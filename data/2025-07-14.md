### [2] [TableReasoner: Advancing Table Reasoning Framework with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08046)
*Sishi Xiong,Dakai Wang,Yu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Changzai Pan,Haowei He,Xiangyu Li,Wenhan Chang,Zhongjiang He,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "TableReasoner," a framework leveraging large language models and programming for efficient table question answering, addressing challenges of real-world tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges such as large table sizes, incomplete semantics, and entity ambiguity in real-world tabular data while enhancing table question-answering (TQA) systems.

Method: The framework adopts a schema combining structural and semantic representations of tables, supported by a multi-step schema linking to focus on query-relevant information. It uses iterative cycles of thinking, reasoning, and reflection.

Result: "TableReasoner" achieved first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves table reasoning by precisely focusing on query-relevant table elements, eliminating ambiguity, and enabling iterative reasoning workflows.

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [3] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses jailbreaking in large language models (LLMs) using a game theory-based approach and proposes a proactive solution called Purple Agent to mitigate such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the critical challenge of jailbreaking in LLMs, where adversaries manipulate models to bypass safety mechanisms, ensuring safer deployment in sensitive applications.

Method: The paper models attacker-defender dynamics using a dynamic Stackelberg game framework and introduces the Purple Agent. This agent applies Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) for adversarial exploration and defense simulation to preempt attacks.

Result: The Purple Agent is shown to actively simulate attack vectors and intervene proactively, providing a structured approach to analyzing adversarial risks and defending against jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and Purple Agent offer a systematic methodology to understand and mitigate jailbreak risks in LLMs, facilitating safer use of these models in critical applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

### [4] [Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208)
*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents LLM-Nash, a game-theoretic model that uses large language models to capture bounded rationality in decision-making. It explores reasoning equilibria in prompt-guided interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of classical game theory, which assumes fully rational agents, by introducing a framework that accounts for bounded rationality using reasoning prompts and LLMs.

Method: The paper models equilibrium as reasoning prompts guiding the outputs of LLMs, rather than traditional utility-maximizing strategies. It focuses on cognitive constraints and epistemic learning through game-theoretic analysis.

Result: Reasoning equilibria from the LLM-Nash framework differ from classical Nash equilibria. Illustrative examples demonstrate the potential of this framework in studying strategic interactions.

Conclusion: The LLM-Nash framework provides a novel approach to studying decision-making and strategic interactions in systems influenced by large language models, emphasizing bounded rationality.

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

### [5] [From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)
*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the interplay between curiosity (seeking knowledge) and competence (controlling the environment) in driving exploration, drawing connections between cognitive theories and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how intelligent agents balance curiosity and competence during exploration, inspired by observations of human behavior such as children playing and scientists experimenting.

Method: The study compares two model-based agents: one using predefined state abstractions (Tabular) and the other learning an internal world model (Dreamer). These approaches are analyzed for their exploration patterns and representation learning.

Result: The Tabular agent demonstrates distinct exploration patterns driven by curiosity and competence, with combined prioritization enhancing exploration efficiency. The Dreamer agent shows a reciprocal relationship between its exploration and representation learning, akin to how curiosity and competence develop in humans.

Conclusion: Adaptive exploration is characterized by a trade-off between seeking novel experiences and mastering controllable aspects of the environment, and these results contribute to cognitive theories and improving reinforcement learning strategies.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [6] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parametrized family of grounding methods for Neural-Symbolic systems, seeking a balance between logic expressiveness and computational scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current Neural-Symbolic methods wherein exhaustive derivations lead to scalability issues, and heuristic-based derivations are computationally efficient but lack justification and guarantees.

Method: The authors propose a generalized family of grounding methods inspired by Backward Chaining, allowing for flexible selection of criteria to balance expressiveness and scalability.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that selecting the right grounding criterion is often as impactful as the choice of Neural-Symbolic method.

Conclusion: The proposed grounding family provides a structured way to optimize the trade-off between reasoning expressiveness and scalability, with significant implications for Neural-Symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [7] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new multimodal quantum federated learning (QFL) framework with quantum entanglement and a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism to address issues caused by missing data. It achieves significant accuracy improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum federated learning frameworks focus mainly on unimodal systems, limiting their relevance to real-world tasks with multiple data modalities.

Method: The study introduces a quantum-based multimodal QFL framework using intermediate fusion via quantum entanglement. It also incorporates a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism to isolate untrained quantum circuits and maintain stable training.

Result: The proposed approach improves model accuracy by 6.84% for IID data distributions and 7.25% for non-IID distributions compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal QFL framework and MMA mechanism offer a significant step forward in distributed quantum machine learning, enabling robust performance in scenarios involving multiple modalities and missing data.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: To address potential risks associated with giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Method: Examines the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, identifies potential harmful vectors, and calls for further technical research.

Result: Identified unique vectors of harm that grant AI access to cryptocurrencies and smart contracts can create.

Conclusion: More technical research is needed to mitigate risks before safely enabling AI to interact with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as
well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position
paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this
argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each
of these new vectors of harm in detail. Finally, we conclude with a call for
more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and,
thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts.

### [9] [Abductive Computational Systems: Creative Abduction and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08264)
*Abhinav Sood,Kazjon Grace,Stephen Wan,Cecile Paris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how abductive reasoning is understood in various fields and analyzes computational implementations, highlighting limitations in generating creative hypotheses and suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and implementing creative abductive reasoning in computational systems across different domains.

Method: Reviewed theoretical discussions of abductive reasoning in epistemology, science, and design; analyzed computational systems' use of abductive reasoning; and identified key limitations.

Result: Found that theoretical frameworks and computational implementations generally fail to address the generation of creative abductive hypotheses.

Conclusion: The paper identifies specific areas for future research to enhance creative abductive reasoning in computational contexts.

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

### [10] [Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270)
*Zeyang Sha,Hanling Tian,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified safety-alignment framework for autonomous LLM agents using tools, addressing risks from both user-initiated and tool-initiated threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address new safety risks in the deployment of autonomous LLM agents capable of using tools, such as vulnerabilities to adversarial prompts and malicious tool outputs.

Method: The authors propose a unified safety-alignment framework that uses structured reasoning, sandboxed reinforcement learning, a tri-modal taxonomy for categorizing threats, and a policy-driven decision model in a sandbox environment for real-world simulations.

Result: Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like Agent SafetyBench and InjecAgent show that safety-aligned agents notably improve resistance to security threats while maintaining strong performance in benign tasks.

Conclusion: Safety and utility can be optimized simultaneously, paving the way for safer deployment of LLM agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

### [11] [M2-Reasoning: Empowering MLLMs with Unified General and Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08306)
*Inclusion AI,:,Fudong Wang,Jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Kaixiang Ji,Lixiang Ru,Qingpei Guo,Ruobing Zheng,Tianqi Li,Yi Yuan,Yifan Mao,Yuting Xiao,Ziping Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents M2-Reasoning-7B, a multimodal language model excelling in general and spatial reasoning through curated data and advanced training, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions essential for real-world applications.

Method: The approach involves a novel data pipeline producing 294.2K high-quality samples and a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization.

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 benchmarks, excelling in general and spatial reasoning domains.

Conclusion: The combination of high-quality data and advanced training methodologies addresses the shortcomings of current MLLMs, advancing reasoning capabilities and setting new performance standards.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

### [12] [Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08392)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework using an ethics advocate agent in multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate drafts of ethics requirements, demonstrating promising results through case studies but noting the need for human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure that ethical considerations are integrated into system design, addressing challenges like resource constraints and lack of prioritization during requirements elicitation.

Method: The authors introduce an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM environment to analyze system descriptions and provide ethical recommendations. They test this approach using case studies.

Result: The framework captures most ethics requirements from human researchers in interviews and even identifies additional relevant ones. However, it shows reliability issues that demand human feedback.

Conclusion: The framework enhances ethics integration into requirements engineering, but human input remains critical to address reliability challenges, paving the way for more ethically aligned systems.

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and analysis of 'Why P but not Q?' explanations by formalizing problems and evaluating their differences in causes.

Method: Defining contrastive explanation problems in propositional logic, analyzing their computational complexity, and implementing solutions using answer set programming.

Result: The framework identifies cardinality-minimal contrastive explanations and showcases its applicability via implemented examples with CNF-formulas.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust foundation for contrastive explanations, advancing their theoretical and practical understanding, while offering tools for their application.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations,
each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a
cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the
literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational
complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas
using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how
they work in practice.

### [14] [From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501)
*Keying Yang,Hao Wang,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel bi-level framework that utilizes a two-stage process to map natural language queries into symbolic reasoning programs using large language models, showing significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of structured reasoning over natural language, which requires bridging the gap between unstructured linguistic inputs and formal logical outputs.

Method: The proposed method employs a bi-level framework: an upper level for parsing language into intermediate structured representations and a lower level for generating symbolic workflows or executable programs. It is further optimized with end-to-end bi-level optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrated notable improvement in reasoning accuracy across various benchmarks, with gains reaching up to 40% over existing baselines.

Conclusion: The framework not only outperforms existing reasoning systems in accuracy but also enhances transparency and error traceability, marking a substantial step toward trustworthy and modular reasoning using LLMs.

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

*Mingda Zhang,Na Zhao,Jianglong Qin,Guoyu Ye,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that improves rare-disease diagnosis by using medical concept activation and a hierarchical knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-disease diagnosis remains challenging due to insufficient depth in knowledge representation, poor concept understanding, and limited clinical reasoning in existing medical models.

Method: The authors propose a framework that combines multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph, utilizing four matching algorithms, diversity control, and a fallback strategy for accuracy.

Result: Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set demonstrated BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with a peak accuracy of 0.89, close to the clinical threshold of 0.90.

Conclusion: This framework improves diagnosis quality and reasoning, potentially reducing the time to diagnose rare diseases and advancing healthcare applications.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Motivation: Addressing the labor-intensive process of georeferencing complex biological sample records using automated methods.

Method: Introducing a grid-based approach utilizing LMM in a zero-shot setting to interpret spatial relations from maps and locality descriptions.

Result: Experiments yielded an average distance error of ~1 km, outperforming traditional tools and uni-modal models.

Conclusion: This novel method shows potential and lays the groundwork for integration into practical georeferencing workflows.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

### [17] [Unlocking Speech Instruction Data Potential with Query Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08603)
*Yonghua Hei,Yibo Yan,Shuliang Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework leveraging multi-LLM knowledge and TTS models to enhance speech instruction dataset construction without relying on human annotation, increasing data usability significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for creating speech instruction datasets are hindered by dataset limitations, biases, and the high cost of human annotation.

Method: A novel query rewriting framework utilizes multiple LLM agents for annotation and validation, optimizing text instructions for conversion into speech via TTS models.

Result: The framework increased data usability from 72% to 93%, showing superior performance in rewriting tasks that demand complex knowledge and context-related expertise.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables cost-effective and high-quality construction of speech instruction datasets, overcoming limitations of previous approaches and enhancing the applicability of TTS models.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

### [18] [Agentic Large Language Models for Conceptual Systems Engineering and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08619)
*Soheyl Massoudi,Mark Fuge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent system (MAS) against a two-agent system (2AS) in early-stage engineering design using a solar-powered water filtration system as the test case. Metrics like JSON integrity, requirement coverage, and code compatibility are compared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining task continuity and generating executable models during early-stage engineering design, which existing LLM workflows struggle with.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) with nine roles to iteratively construct and refine a Design-State Graph (DSG), a structured JSON representation of design data. It compares this system with a simpler two-agent system (2AS) by running 60 experiments using two different LLMs and varying configurations.

Result: Both MAS and 2AS showed perfect JSON integrity but low requirement coverage (below 20%). The MAS created more detailed DSGs, while the 2AS achieved higher code compatibility under specific settings. The reasoning-distilled model (DeepSeek R1 70B) improved workflow completion but overall challenges remained.

Conclusion: A structured multi-agent system improves design granularity and detail, but gaps in requirement coverage and coding fidelity persist. Using reasoning-distilled LLMs enhances workflow completion, but significant room for improvement exists.

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

*Xingguang Ji,Yahui Liu,Qi Wang,Jingyuan Zhang,Yang Yue,Rui Shi,Chenxi Sun,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7 billion parameter large language model that improves formal theorem proving in Lean 4 using verifier-integrated Reinforcement Learning and feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance automated theorem proving by leveraging verifier feedback to create a model that can self-correct its reasoning and demonstrate improved performance over previous versions.

Method: The method involves utilizing Reinforcement Learning with feedback from a Lean 4 verifier to make the model 'self-aware' of its errors and correct them. Techniques such as multi-turn verifier interaction, feedback token masking, and a simple reward strategy were employed.

Result: Leanabell-Prover-V2 showed a 3.2% improvement in pass@128 with one baseline model and a 2.0% improvement with another on the MiniF2F test set.

Conclusion: The integration of verifier feedback into Reinforcement Learning results in a more effective theorem-proving LLM. The paper claims this approach optimizes reasoning trajectories and enhances model performance over prior versions.

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

### [20] [Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08664)
*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reasoning framework for AI agents called Introspection of Thought (INoT), which enhances LLM capabilities by incorporating programmatic dialogue reasoning into prompts, achieving higher performance and reduced token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current limitations of AI Agents relying on LLMs and MLLMs involve inherent challenges in understanding natural language and high computational costs due to iterative reasoning. The authors aim to address these inefficiencies.

Method: INoT framework integrates a specially designed LLM-Read code within prompts, enabling internal programmatic reasoning instead of external iterative processes, thereby embedding self-reflection into LLMs.

Result: Their approach improved performance by an average of 7.95% across six benchmarks for three tasks and reduced token costs by 58.3% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed INoT framework is effective in improving AI Agent reasoning and inference capabilities while significantly lowering computational costs, demonstrating its versatility in both text and image tasks.

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

use of LLMs. Our approach can be re-applied to new applications with minimal
setup requirements. We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text
input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.
Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a
reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to
accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to
enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the complexity and potential failures in exploring novel architectures for system-of-systems using physics-based simulations.

Method: The paper employs surrogate-based optimization approaches, particularly Bayesian optimization leveraging Gaussian process models, to reduce computational costs and address evaluation challenges.

Result: Efficient surrogate-based methods are proposed to explore and optimize architectures in computationally intensive contexts.

Conclusion: Surrogate-based optimization, specifically Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, is effective in simplifying the modeling and optimization process for system-of-systems architectures, overcoming computational challenges.

Abstract: For developing innovative systems architectures, modeling and optimization
techniques have been central to frame the architecting process and define the
optimization and modeling problems. In this context, for system-of-systems the
use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is
highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted

increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization

*Weigang Feng,Yijia Zhang,Zekun Wang,Zhengyang Wang,Yi Wang,Peijun Ma,Ningyi Xu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCSS, a multi-core RTL simulation platform addressing simulation speed limitations of CPUs by enhancing compilation and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing transistor counts in chips leading to increased complexity in RTL-level simulation, making CPU-based simulation inefficient.

Method: Developed CCSS platform leveraging balanced DAG partitioning, efficient boolean computation cores, and low-latency NoC for improved multi-core simulation.

Result: Achieved up to 12.9x simulation speedup compared to existing multi-core simulators.

Conclusion: CCSS successfully combines fast compilation and high throughput, addressing CPU bottlenecks in functional debug simulation.

Abstract: As transistor counts in a single chip exceed tens of billions, the complexity
of RTL-level simulation and verification has grown exponentially, often
extending simulation campaigns to several months. In industry practice, RTL
simulation is divided into two phases: functional debug and system validation.
While system validation demands high simulation speed and is typically
accelerated using FPGAs, functional debug relies on rapid compilation-rendering
multi-core CPUs the primary choice. However, the limited simulation speed of
CPUs has become a major bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose CCSS,
a scalable multi-core RTL simulation platform that achieves both fast
compilation and high simulation throughput. CCSS accelerates combinational
logic computation and sequential logic synchronization through specialized
architecture and compilation strategies. It employs a balanced DAG partitioning
method and efficient boolean computation cores for combinational logic, and
adopts a low-latency network-on-chip (NoC) design to synchronize sequential
states across cores efficiently. Experimental results show that CCSS delivers
up to 12.9x speedup over state-of-the-art multi-core simulators.

### [24] [Fast and Efficient Merge of Sorted Input Lists in Hardware Using List Offset Merge Sorters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08658)
*Robert B. Kent,Marios S. Pattichis*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS), a hardware-based approach to merge sorted lists faster and more efficiently than traditional methods using minimal sorting stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies of traditional merge sort hardware, particularly limitations when handling input lists of variable sizes and unequal lengths.

Method: A novel approach called List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS) is proposed, employing offset input arrangements and alternating sort stages to achieve a fully sorted output. LOMS integrates Single-Stage 2-way Merge Sorters (S2MS) for faster processing.

Result: LOMS outperforms state-of-the-art sorting devices, achieving faster speeds and using fewer FPGA resources. For instance, a LOMS 2-way sorter achieves a processing time of 2.24 nS for 64 values, a 2.63x speedup compared to existing Batcher devices.

Conclusion: The proposed LOMS devices are superior in terms of speed and resource efficiency, making them highly suitable for FPGA implementations where traditional methods may struggle with performance or capacity constraints.

Abstract: A new set of hardware merge sort devices are introduced here, which merge
multiple sorted input lists into a single sorted output list in a fast and
efficient manner. In each merge sorter, the values from the sorted input lists
are arranged in an input 2-D setup array, but with the order of each sorted
input list offset from the order of each of the other sorted input lists. In
these new devices, called List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS), a minimal set of
column sort stages alternating with row sort stages process the input setup
array into a final output array, now in the defined sorted order. LOMS 2-way
sorters, which merge 2 sorted input lists, require only 2 merge stages and are
significantly faster than Kenneth Batcher's previous state-of-the-art 2-way
merge devices, Bitonic Merge Sorters and Odd-Even Merge Sorters. LOMS 2-way
sorters utilize the recently-introduced Single-Stage 2-way Merge Sorters (S2MS)
in their first stage. Both LOMS and S2MS devices can merge any mixture of input
list sizes, while Batcher's merge sorters are difficult to design unless the 2
input lists are equal, and a power-of-2. By themselves, S2MS devices are the
fastest 2-way merge sorters when implemented in this study's target FPGA
devices, but they tend to use a large number of LUT resources. LOMS 2-way
devices use fewer resources than comparable S2MS devices, enabling some large
LOMS devices to be implemented in a given FPGA when comparable S2MS devices
cannot fit in that FPGA. A List Offset 2-way sorter merges 2 lists, each with
32 values, into a sorted output list of those 64 values in 2.24 nS, a speedup
of 2.63 versus a comparable Batcher device. A LOMS 3-way merge sorter, merging
3 sorted input lists with 7 values, fully merges the 21 values in 3.4 nS, a
speedup of 1.36 versus the comparable state-of-the-art 3-way merge device.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel fine-tuning regime for prompt-based Text-to-Speech models to enhance controllability by incorporating new labels derived from latent features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based Text-to-Speech models struggle with limited control over acoustic features and uncontrollable variance due to corpus statistics.

Method: The study uses principal component analysis on synthesized samples to identify latent features and fine-tunes the model with these features as labels.

Result: The proposed method improves the controllability of a Text-to-Speech model, especially when trained without emotional disclosure.

Conclusion: Using latent features for secondary fine-tuning enhances both discrete and continuous control of Text-to-Speech models.

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Performance metrics like F1-score and accuracy were used for evaluation.

Result: MedicalBERT outperformed other biomedical BERT-based models such as BioBERT, SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT in most benchmarks, with an average performance gain of 5.67% over the general-purpose BERT model.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning and pretrained BERT models in tailoring NLP tools for specialized domains like biomedical literature while enhancing task-specific performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the sophistication and evolution of jailbreak strategies for large language models (LLMs) and their implications for AI safety.

Method: Conducted an empirical analysis of over 2 million real-world conversations from various platforms, using metrics like lexical diversity, probabilistic measures, and cognitive load.

Result: Jailbreak attempts are not significantly more complex than normal conversations, and their complexity has remained stable over time. Defensive mechanisms in LLMs have improved, as indicated by reduced assistant response toxicity.

Conclusion: Human ingenuity imposes limits on jailbreak complexity, contrasting the idea of an escalating attacker-defender arms race. Over-disclosure of sophisticated attack methods poses risks to current equilibrium.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance and limitations of a financial domain-specific language model, FinGPT, in real-world financial applications.

Method: Conducting evaluations on six financial NLP tasks using finance-specific datasets and comparing results with GPT-4 and human benchmarks.

Result: FinGPT excels in classification tasks like sentiment analysis and headline categorization but struggles with reasoning and generative tasks like financial Q&A and summarization, showing notable performance gaps in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning.

Conclusion: FinGPT is effective for structured financial tasks but requires architectural improvements and domain-specific optimization to be a more comprehensive financial language model solution.

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

TL;DR: This paper synthesizes findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI) to propose a three-tiered model of machine understanding, arguing that LLMs exhibit forms of understanding but differ fundamentally in cognitive architecture from humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the debate on whether LLMs genuinely understand or simply rely on superficial statistics by exploring their internal structures and proposing a new theoretical framework for machine understanding.

Method: The authors synthesize recent findings in MI and introduce a three-tiered model of machine understanding (conceptual, state-of-the-world, and principled understanding), grounded in the functions and behavior of LLMs.

Result: The study finds that LLMs develop internal structures akin to human-like understanding, such as features, factual connections, and circuits, but their cognitive processes differ significantly from human cognition.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit machine understanding in various forms, but their strange and different cognitive architecture suggests the debate should shift from whether they understand to understanding how their unique mechanisms work.

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a simple framework called R3 to enhance masked text diffusion models, enabling them to identify and correct their errors more effectively during iterative text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling text generation models to efficiently detect and correct their own errors without requiring extra model training.

Method: The R3 framework operates in three stages: Review using a Process Reward Model to evaluate generated text, Remask low-scoring segments to focus attention on potential errors, and Refine these specific parts of the text to improve the final output.

Result: R3 optimizes error detection and correction in pre-trained masked text diffusion models like LLaDA or BD3-LM, leading to higher-quality text generation.

Conclusion: By leveraging targeted error correction mechanisms, R3 offers a practical and model-agnostic solution to enhance iterative text generation models without additional training requirements.

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

### [31] [Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019)
*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the consistency of resume evaluations by large language models (LLMs) compared to human experts. LLMs demonstrate significant variations and differing adaptive behavior across contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs exhibit consistent or random behavior when evaluating resumes against job descriptions, and how their accuracy compares to human recruiters.

Method: Three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini) were tested across various contexts using controlled datasets of resumes and benchmarks, with statistical analysis to measure consistency and divergence.

Result: Statistical tests showed varying adaptiveness among LLMs, with GPT displaying strong contextual adaptation, Gemini showing partial adaptation, and Claude showing minimal. All LLMs behaved significantly differently compared to human experts.

Conclusion: LLMs show interpretable but substantially divergent patterns from human judgment, suggesting careful deployment in automated hiring systems for optimized performance.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

### [32] [Circumventing Safety Alignment in Large Language Models Through Embedding Space Toxicity Attenuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08020)
*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ETTA, a framework targeting vulnerabilities in LLMs' embedding spaces, achieving higher attack success rates against safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient understanding of LLM safety alignment dynamics in the embedding space and to study targeted adversarial perturbation techniques.

Method: The ETTA framework identifies and attenuates toxicity-sensitive embedding dimensions using linear transformations, bypassing safety mechanisms without requiring model fine-tuning or training data.

Result: ETTA achieved an attack success rate of 88.61% on five open-source LLMs and effectively generalizes to safety-enhanced models with a 77.39% success rate on instruction-tuned defenses.

Conclusion: The findings expose critical vulnerabilities in existing LLM alignment strategies and call for embedding-aware defensive mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

*Li Li,Yongliang Wu,Jingze Zhu,Jiawei Peng,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper conducts an external and internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), focusing on the image captioning task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in multimodal In-Context Learning (ICL) research, particularly in understanding the impact of demonstration configuration strategies and controllability of in-context examples.

Method: The paper uses external exploration of demonstration strategies (shot number, image retrieval, caption assignment) and internal investigation with attention-based metrics to study Large Multimodal Models for image captioning.

Result: Key findings on model performance influenced by ICEs (In-Context Examples) configuration and attention characteristics, along with auxiliary experiments for model acceleration and compression feasibility.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into multimodal ICL in LMMs, revealing performance impacts and attention behaviors, and introduces a dual-perspective analysis method applicable to broader areas.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

### [34] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the political leanings of seven prominent LLMs and finds a consistent liberal orientation attributed to multiple factors, including training and fine-tuning practices. This tilt reflects democratic rights-focused discourse and may provide insights into collective reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the underlying causes and implications of the observed liberal orientation in the ethical and political outputs of commercial LLMs.

Method: The study uses Moral Foundations Theory, a variety of political ideology scales, and an index of current political controversies to systematically analyze the political temperament of seven LLMs.

Result: Findings highlight a consistent liberal prioritization, particularly on values like care and fairness, influenced by training corpora, RLHF, academic ethical discourse, and safety fine-tuning. Fine-tuning amplifies this liberal bias.

Conclusion: The liberal tilt is not considered a programming error but an emergent property of training data engaged with democratic rights discourse. The study suggests this orientation could reflect an impartial moral stance akin to Rawls' veil-of-ignorance concept, offering a framework for collective reasoning.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

*Ada Aka,Emil Palikot,Ali Ansari,Nima Yazdani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares traditional recruitment with an AI-assisted process for junior developer applicants, finding the latter improves hiring efficiency and candidate outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited empirical evidence on AI's impact on recruitment efficiency and candidate selection quality.

Method: Randomly assigned 37,000 applicants to either a traditional process or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline. Both groups faced the same final human interview with interviewers blind to selection track.

Result: Candidates in the AI-assisted process had a 20 percentage points higher success rate in final interviews (54% vs. 34%) and a 5.9 pp higher probability of finding new jobs (23% vs. 18%).

Conclusion: AI can improve hiring efficiency and outcomes but tends to select younger, less experienced candidates. The research illuminates AI's implications on recruitment decisions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

TL;DR: MM-Coder introduces a multimodal code generation approach integrating text and visual inputs such as UML diagrams and flowcharts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing text-only language models in code generation by incorporating visual aids that align better with real-world software development needs.

Method: They developed MM-Coder and MMc-Instruct, leveraging a multimodal instruction-tuning dataset and introduced MMEval as a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: MM-Coder significantly enhances code generation accuracy by incorporating visual and textual inputs, but evaluations using MMEval reveal ongoing challenges.

Conclusion: MM-Coder represents a step forward in enabling LLMs to interpret complex text and visual specifications, though improvements in precision and understanding are needed.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the decreasing presence of medical disclaimers in generative AI (LLM and VLM) outputs and stresses the need for safeguarding disclaimers as AI models grow influential in medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the declining use of medical disclaimers in AI models' outputs as they are increasingly used in clinical settings, despite the risks of inaccuracies.

Method: The study evaluated outputs from LLMs and VLMs generated from 2022 to 2025 using data from 2,000 medical images and 500 medical questions, screening for the presence of medical disclaimers.

Result: The presence of medical disclaimers in AI model outputs dropped significantly from 2022 (26.3%) to 2025 (0.97%) for LLMs, and from 2023 (19.6%) to 2025 (1.05%) for VLMs.

Conclusion: Disclaimer usage in AI models is decreasing over time, raising concerns about user safety and the need for safeguards, especially as these models become more authoritative in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

*Hong Jia,Shiya Fu,Vassilis Kostakos,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the mental health understanding capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) using various classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of SLMs as privacy-preserving tools for sensitive applications in mental health analysis, given their smaller scale and fewer parameters.

Method: The study systematically benchmarks five SLMs and three LLMs on six mental health classification tasks using zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms.

Result: SLMs perform comparably to LLMs on binary classification tasks, with only a 2% difference in mean performance. Few-shot learning boosts SLM performance significantly, while multi-class severity tasks remain challenging for both model types.

Conclusion: SLMs show promise as privacy-preserving and scalable tools for mental health analysis, especially given their efficiency in adapting through few-shot learning.

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework that integrates external tools with large language models (LLMs) to improve accuracy in educational queries. Achieving notable results in mathematical and scientific reasoning, it surpasses state-of-the-art models in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of LLMs in querying tasks, specifically their inaccuracies and tendency to hallucinate, by integrating external tools to provide contextual information.

Method: The proposed framework connects LLMs with external APIs to retrieve additional relevant information and computational functionalities like calculators and calendars, tested using MMLU datasets.

Result: The framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific reasoning, outperforming leading models like GPT-4o and LLaMA-Large, whose best baseline scores are 67% and 79%, respectively.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of integrating external tools into LLMs for creating sophisticated ecosystems to enhance their application in various educational and computational tasks.

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reviews 68 publications and surveys 50 clinicians to understand the gap between MedVQA advancements and clinical integration. Key issues include lack of clinical relevance, limited multimodal analysis, and mismatched evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance the clinical utility of Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) systems, as their integration into radiology workflows remains suboptimal despite advancements.

Method: The study applies the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework by systematically analyzing 68 studies for research gaps and surveying 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to understand clinical needs and challenges.

Result: Most MedVQA datasets lack features like multi-view imaging, EHR integration, and domain knowledge. Clinician surveys show 87.2% demand patient history integration, 78.7% want multi-view image support, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based systems.

Conclusion: Though MedVQA holds potential, addressing issues like better multimodal analysis, context-awareness, and improved evaluation metrics is crucial for its clinical applicability.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP introduces a multi-domain dataset for improving LLM reasoning via high-level plan generation, outperforming Chain-of-Thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex problem-solving reasoning, necessitating advancements over existing methods like Chain-of-Thought approaches.

Method: CRISP employs automatically generated and validated step-based plans for reasoning tasks across diverse domains, coupled with fine-tuning smaller models for enhanced performance.

Result: Fine-tuned smaller models surpass larger models relying on few-shot prompting and improve out-of-domain plan generation, showcasing generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicit high-level plan generation via CRISP significantly enhances reasoning in LLMs, showing potential for generalized improvements across tasks and domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

*Talor Abramovich,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents AblationBench, a benchmark to evaluate language model agents on tasks related to ablation planning in AI research. Current frontier models struggle with these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and evaluate the capability of AI agents in supporting empirical AI research, specifically in planning ablation experiments—a key component of this research.

Method: They developed AblationBench, which includes two main tasks: AuthorAblation (proposing experiments) and ReviewerAblation (identifying missing experiments). They also designed LM-based judges for automatic evaluation.

Result: The best-performing language model system could only identify 29% of the original ablations. Chain-of-thought prompting proved more effective than the existing agent-based approach.

Conclusion: Significant room for improvement remains in using language models for ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research.

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

### [43] [Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08045)
*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Krul,' a system that improves multi-turn conversation efficiency in large language models (LLMs) by optimizing key-value (KV) cache restoration through dynamic and customized compression strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for KV cache restoration in LLMs use static compression strategies that do not adapt to conversation-specific attention patterns, causing reduced accuracy and inefficiency.

Method: Krul employs three innovations: a dynamic compression strategy selector, a token-wise attention similarity estimator, and a bubble-free restoration scheduler to optimize KV cache restoration during multi-turn conversations.

Result: Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage while maintaining generation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Krul effectively addresses inefficiencies in KV cache restoration for LLMs, offering a robust and adaptable solution that balances speed, storage reduction, and accuracy in multi-turn conversations.

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

### [44] [GRASP: Generic Reasoning And SPARQL Generation across Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08107)
*Sebastian Walter,Hannah Bast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate SPARQL queries from natural language using large language models without fine-tuning, achieving strong results across various knowledge graphs and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the translation of natural language or keyword queries into SPARQL, enabling wider and easier access to RDF knowledge graphs.

Method: The method employs a large language model for exploring RDF knowledge graphs by iteratively executing SPARQL queries and identifying relevant results, without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Wikidata across several benchmarks, near state-of-the-art results on Freebase, and strong performance on other knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the potential of leveraging large language models for knowledge graph query generation without fine-tuning, offering competitive and scalable performance across datasets.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

*Reilly Raab,Mike Parker,Dan Nally,Sadie Montgomery,Anastasia Bernat,Sai Munikoti,Sameera Horawalavithana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to responsibly integrate language models (LMs) into workflows, ensuring transparency and auditability while improving performance with sparse human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address barriers to real-world adoption of LMs, such as concerns around safety, explainability, and bias, and find ways to responsibly and transparently harness their capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a static typing framework for LM-powered subroutines that records all artifacts for auditing and incorporates human feedback to improve performance. This framework was implemented as a library and tested in an environmental public comment processing application.

Result: The application "CommentNEPA" used the framework to process public comment data, and its outputs were evaluated quantitatively against historical ground-truth data annotated by humans.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for improving LM-based workflows in a transparent and auditable manner, with potential applications in fields like healthcare, legal, and environmental review.

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

### [46] [Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)
*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Compactor, a query-agnostic KV cache compression strategy for LLMs to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' large context windows require significant memory for KV caches, which limits throughput and increases deployment costs.

Method: Compactor uses approximate leverage scores to compress KV caches, with a query-agnostic approach and minimal computational overhead. Additionally, a context-calibrated compression procedure identifies maximum possible compression ratios.

Result: Compactor achieves the same performance as competitors while reducing token retention by 50% and lowering KV memory usage by 63% on average, even across 27 diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Compactor is an effective and generalizable method to reduce KV memory burden in LLMs without sacrificing task performance.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

### [47] [Distilling Empathy from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08151)
*Henry J. Xie,Jinghan Zhang,Xinhao Zhang,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to distill empathy capabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller language models (SLMs) through a two-step fine-tuning approach and empathy-specific prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the empathetic capabilities of LLMs are preserved in SLMs, which are used in resource-constrained environments such as smartphones for human interaction.

Method: The authors propose a two-step fine-tuning process utilizing empathetic dialogue datasets distilled from LLMs, and introduce four tailored prompts for targeted empathy improvement to enhance the distillation process.

Result: Experiments show that the fine-tuned SLMs outperform the base SLM in generating empathetic responses with a 90% win rate. The targeted empathy improvement prompts provide a 10% improvement over basic direct prompting in win rate.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy successfully retains and enhances empathy in SLMs during the distillation process, making them more suitable for human-centric applications where resources are limited.

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

TL;DR: This paper presents TruthTorchLM, an open-source Python library featuring over 30 methods for predicting the truthfulness of Generative Large Language Model (LLM) outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigating untruthful responses generated by LLMs is crucial, especially in contexts where accuracy is critical.

Method: The paper introduces TruthTorchLM, a library consolidating diverse truth prediction methods, compatible with frameworks like HuggingFace and LiteLLM.

Result: TruthTorchLM integrates over 30 truth methods and is evaluated on datasets like TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM provides a valuable, extensible toolkit for advancing research in predicting LLM truthfulness and ensures easy accessibility for wider use.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

### [49] [Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218)
*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) leads to unexpected out-of-distribution generalization (OOCR) and proposes a mechanism behind this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why LLMs exhibit out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is critical for ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in real-world applications.

Method: The study investigates OOCR behavior by analyzing LoRA fine-tuning, which essentially adds a constant steering vector guiding models toward a general concept. Additionally, the authors directly train steering vectors from scratch to analyze their effects.

Result: Fine-tuning via steering vectors explains OOCR, demonstrating surprising generalization across concept-related domains. The authors show that steering vectors can induce this behavior even in cases where conditional behavior is expected.

Conclusion: The paper provides a mechanistic explanation for OOCR during fine-tuning, enhancing the understanding of advanced LLM capabilities and addressing a critical aspect of their reliable use.

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

### [50] [Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Real Students' Abilities in Mathematics and Reading Comprehension?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08232)
*KV Aditya Srivatsa,Kaushal Kumar Maurya,Ekaterina Kochmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as proxy students by comparing them to real students using educational assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if LLMs can emulate real students' behavior and performance in Intelligent Tutoring Systems and test questions to assist in educational tools.

Method: The researchers used a dataset of 489 NAEP items in math and reading, applied an Item Response Theory model, and assessed 11 diverse LLMs against real student performance.

Result: Strong LLMs outperformed average students, weaker models occasionally aligned with student performance, and grade-enforcement prompts impacted performance variably depending on the model and prompt specifics.

Conclusion: LLMs require tailored training and evaluation for achieving effective and consistent alignment with real-grade student behavior across subjects and grades.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

*Ancita Maria Andrade,Tanvi Banerjee,Ramakrishna Mundugar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study employed NLP and HAM-CNN to analyze gender differences in pain experiences, classifying text with an F1 score of 0.86 and identifying distinct emotional and condition-based disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past research often overlooked gender-specific aspects of pain experiences despite extensive exploration of pain causes and treatments.

Method: NLP techniques and HAM-CNN were used to classify male and female corpora, aggregating posts via usernames.

Result: Gender differences in linguistic focus, prevalence of pain conditions like migraines and sinusitis, and varied effects of medication were observed.

Conclusion: Gender significantly influences pain experiences, necessitating consideration of linguistic and medical differences in treatment approaches.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), a 40B large language model designed for reasoning-intensive tasks by dynamically adapting between reasoning and non-reasoning modes to reduce inefficiencies. The model achieves state-of-the-art results while optimizing token usage by 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models face challenges in reasoning-intensive tasks due to overthinking and inefficiencies. The motivation behind KAT is to improve the reasoning process, balancing complexity and efficiency in task performance for better real-world application.

Method: The authors propose an automatic thinking training paradigm with a dual-regime dataset, Multi-Token Prediction-enhanced knowledge distillation, a cold-start initialization strategy, and a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Step-SRPO. These methods aim to enhance structured reasoning and mode selection while minimizing costs.

Result: Experimental results show KAT matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models across different benchmarks while reducing token usage by approximately 30%. It demonstrates high performance in both academic evaluations and real-world deployments, such as improving workflows in Kuaishou's coding assistant.

Conclusion: KAT represents a significant step in addressing inefficiencies in reasoning-intensive tasks, proving its scalability and applicability in real-world contexts. Early-stage results from training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts further validate the effectiveness of the AutoThink paradigm.

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

*Yupu Liang,Yaping Zhang,Zhiyang Zhang,Zhiyuan Chen,Yang Zhao,Lu Xiang,Chengqing Zong,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fine-tuning strategy called Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) tasks without compromising their OCR abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models excel in OCR tasks but face significant challenges in DIMT, struggling to balance cross-modal and cross-lingual tasks without losing their OCR proficiency when fine-tuned on DIMT datasets.

Method: The SSR fine-tuning paradigm involves prompting the model to generate OCR text first and then produce translation text, leveraging existing OCR capabilities while learning cross-lingual translation.

Result: Results show that SSR mitigates catastrophic forgetting and improves the model's generalization for both OCR and DIMT tasks.

Conclusion: Synchronously Self-Reviewing enhances the performance of MLLMs in DIMT while retaining their proficiency in OCR, demonstrating its effectiveness through comprehensive experimentation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRMAgent, a system using large language models to enhance e-commerce message writing, significantly improving performance and marketing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merchants in e-commerce often struggle to craft persuasive outbound messages for CRM due to a lack of expertise and scalable tools.

Method: The CRMAgent system employs three approaches: group-based learning from successful messages, retrieval-and-adaptation of relevant templates, and rule-based fallback for zero-shot rewrites.

Result: CRMAgent consistently delivers message templates that outperform original merchant-created content, improving audience alignment and marketing success.

Conclusion: CRMAgent demonstrates that leveraging advanced LLM techniques can significantly enhance messaging quality and effectiveness for e-commerce campaigns.

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MK2, a lightweight, prompt-centric system for generating commercially viable product ideas from patents. It performs well across domains but shows room for improvement in materials-chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of turning patent content into product ideas that are commercially viable within three years, a task with significant implications for innovation and development.

Method: The authors developed MK2, a prompt-focused pipeline involving iterative prompt editing by Gemini 2.5, idea generation via GPT-4.1, and Elo-loop judgment using Qwen3-8B for prompt selection, all using no additional training data.

Result: The system achieved top performance on the automatic leaderboard across three domains and won 25 of 36 evaluations, although it underperformed in the materials-chemistry domain.

Conclusion: MK2 demonstrates that lightweight prompt engineering can generate commercially relevant ideas effectively, though domain-specific grounding is needed in certain areas like materials-chemistry.

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

*Zhichao Xu,Zhiqi Huang,Shengyao Zhuang,Ashim Gupta,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares contrastive learning and knowledge distillation as strategies for training text rerankers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions.

Method: The researchers trained rerankers of varying sizes and architectures using both strategies on the same data, with a strong contrastive learning model as a teacher in the distillation setup.

Result: Knowledge distillation generally outperforms contrastive learning for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks when a larger teacher model is used, but shows less advantage when the teacher has the same capacity as the student.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is recommended for training smaller rerankers if a larger teacher is accessible; otherwise, contrastive learning is a strong alternative.

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

TL;DR: The study evaluates how prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods affect LLMs and RLLMs in financial question-answering, finding different impacts on their reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective methods that maximize the performance of LLMs and RLLMs in the financial domain, specifically in addressing financial question-answering tasks.

Method: The authors used five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effectiveness of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods in financial QA tasks.

Result: (1) Prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance LLMs' abilities in financial QA by simulating Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). (2) RLLMs already possess Long CoT capabilities, so conventional methods add limited value. (3) Advanced multilingual alignment improves LLM reasoning but has minimal impact on RLLMs.

Conclusion: Current methods improve LLMs but offer limited benefits for RLLMs in financial QA. This study provides a reference point for optimizing LLMs and RLLMs in finance-related tasks.

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

*Itai Mondshine,Tzuf Paz-Argaman,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of n-gram-based and neural-based metrics across eight languages and demonstrates their varied suitability depending on language type and task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the uncertainty surrounding the applicability of automated evaluation metrics, particularly n-gram-based ones like ROUGE, to languages other than English.

Method: The study analyzes eight languages from diverse typological families and resource levels to systematically assess correlations between evaluation metrics and human judgments.

Result: Findings reveal that n-gram-based metrics are less correlated with human judgments in fusional languages compared to isolating or agglutinative languages, but tokenization can mitigate this issue. Neural metrics like COMET outperform others, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: N-gram-based metrics are limited for morphologically rich fusional languages. Neural metrics specifically trained for evaluation are recommended for better alignment with human judgments.

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

*Keisuke Ueda,Wataru Hirota,Takuto Asakura,Takahiro Omi,Kosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Arima,Tatsuya Ishigaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies multi-agent dialogues in large language models (LLMs) for scientific idea generation, highlighting configurations that improve novelty and feasibility of ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to optimize structured dialogues within LLM systems to enhance creative tasks like generating scientific research ideas, focusing on improving both the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas.

Method: Analyses configurations involving agent roles, dialogue depth, and number of agents in multi-agent LLM systems, including setups where ideas undergo a critique and revision loop by diverse agents.

Result: Findings indicate that larger agent cohorts, richer persona diversity, and deeper dialogue iterations improve idea novelty, while critic-side diversity enhances feasibility.

Conclusion: The study provides practical design guidelines for effective multi-agent LLM setups to better support scientific ideation tasks, suggesting configurations that enhance both idea generation and refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

### [60] [The Curious Case of Factuality Finetuning: Models' Internal Beliefs Can Improve Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08371)
*Benjamin Newman,Abhilasha Ravichander,Jaehun Jung,Rui Xin,Hamish Ivison,Yegor Kuznetsov,Pang Wei Koh,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning language models on model-generated data filtered by their own internal judgments can reduce hallucinations better compared to using gold (human-curated) data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reducing hallucination in language models, particularly by assessing the impact of different data types used for fine-tuning on factual accuracy.

Method: Analyzed the impact of fine-tuning using various datasets (gold factual data, model-generated data believed factual, and different filtering strategies) and evaluated the influence on hallucination prevalence in long-form text generation.

Result: Fine-tuning on model-generated data filtered by models' own internal judgments led to better factual accuracy, outperforming fine-tuning on gold factual data or other configurations.

Conclusion: Models can generate more factually accurate outputs when fine-tuned on their own filtered, internally-judged data instead of exclusively relying on human-curated factual data.

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

*Zilu Dong,Xiangqing Shen,Zinong Yang,Rui Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChainEdit improves logical consistency in large language model knowledge editing, showing a 30% improvement in generalization and setting new benchmarks for ripple effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining logical consistency during ripple effect propagation in knowledge editing.

Method: ChainEdit integrates knowledge graph rules with LLM reasoning to systematically update logically connected knowledge clusters.

Result: ChainEdit achieved over 30% improvement in logical generalization compared to baselines and set performance benchmarks in ripple effects.

Conclusion: The framework enhances logical generalization and consistency during knowledge editing in LLMs, addressing biases and external dependencies in current evaluations.

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

*Selina Heller,Mohamed Ibrahim,David Antony Selby,Sebastian Vollmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate decision conferences, focusing on detecting agreement among simulated participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage LLMs to mimic real-world decision-making scenarios and improve the efficiency and quality of group deliberations in expert-driven conferences.

Method: The study evaluates six different LLMs on tasks like stance detection and stance polarity detection and integrates these models into a multi-agent system to assess agreement detection.

Result: LLMs effectively detect agreement in nuanced and dynamic discussions, and incorporating agreement-detection agents enhances debate efficiency and outcome quality in simulations.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems show great potential in simulating and supporting group decision-making processes, making them suitable for expert workshops across various fields.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

*Zishan Xu,Shuyi Xie,Qingsong Lv,Shupei Xiao,Linlin Song,Sui Wenjuan,Fan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack effective tools for error attribution. This paper proposes a novel framework, dataset, and model to address this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs generates extensive user-data interactions daily, necessitating efficient tools for performance analysis and error diagnostics.

Method: The paper introduces a Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary error categories, along with a new dataset, AttriData, and a fine-tuned model, MisAttributionLLM, for error analysis.

Result: Experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the MisAttribution Framework, AttriData, and MisAttributionLLM in error categorization and attribution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, dataset, and model offer a systematic approach to better understand and diagnose errors in LLMs, improving model evaluation and reliability.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

### [65] [Using Large Language Models for Legal Decision-Making in Austrian Value-Added Tax Law: An Experimental Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08468)
*Marina Luketina,Andrea Benkel,Christoph G. Schuetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the legal decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Austrian and EU VAT law, highlighting their strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore LLMs' potential to assist in automating legal decision-making and reducing the workload of tax professionals who often handle cases described in natural language.

Method: The paper experiments with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques on textbook and real-world cases to identify optimal configurations of LLM-based systems and assess their legal reasoning capabilities.

Result: LLMs demonstrate capability in supporting tax professionals by automating routine tasks and providing initial legal analyses, but are limited by challenges such as hallucinations, implicit client knowledge, and context-specific documentation.

Conclusion: While LLMs can enhance VAT-related decision-making, structured background information and refinement are needed for effective integration into sensitive legal domains.

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Conclusion: The approach is proven effective in enhancing model performance and is highly applicable for practical scenarios in multilingual ASR and speech separation tasks.

Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025

achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

### [67] [Enhancing Essay Cohesion Assessment: A Novel Item Response Theory Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08487)
*Bruno Alexandre Rosa,Hilário Oliveira,Luiz Rodrigues,Eduardo Araujo Oliveira,Rafael Ferreira Mello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for predicting essay cohesion scores using item response theory, claiming its method surpasses conventional machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate essay cohesion effectively using automated systems due to its critical role in understanding text meaning.

Method: Applied item response theory to tweak cohesion scores generated by machine learning models, using linguistic features and regression tasks on a corpus of 7,798 Brazilian essays.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional machine learning and ensemble approaches in predicting cohesion scores.

Conclusion: The suggested approach improves the reliability of automatic cohesion evaluation in essays, showing promise for educational contexts.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

*David Schlangen,Sherzod Hakimov,Jonathan Jordan,Philipp Sadler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses three paradigms for evaluating large language models, introduces a new approach using dialogue game-based evaluation, and presents clembench—a reusable implementation for model benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing evaluation paradigms for large language models and introduce a reusable solution for dialogue game-based evaluation.

Method: The clembench framework provides benchmark game instances and allows for repeatable, goal-directed evaluations of models, emphasizing extensibility and ease of use.

Result: The paper describes clembench as a mature framework optimized for general use and extends it to support custom targeted tests for benchmarking language models.

Conclusion: Dialogue game-based evaluation is established as a complementary paradigm for model assessment, and clembench is presented as a robust tool aiding adoption of this method.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents LLaPa, a vision-language model framework for generating executable action sequences from textual and visual inputs, with notable improvements in procedural planning demonstrated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance procedural planning in embodied AI systems by incorporating multimodal inputs (text + visual) and counterfactual reasoning, areas which have been less explored with current LLMs.

Method: The researchers developed LLaPa, integrating vision-language models and auxiliary modules: 1) Task-Environment Reranker (TER) for aligning text and visual elements crucial for planning, and 2) Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR) to improve reasoning about potential alternative scenarios.

Result: LLaPa outperformed existing methods based on experiments using ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks, achieving higher scores in metrics like LCS and plan correctness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of LLaPa in multimodal procedural planning and counterfactual reasoning, providing a framework for advancing embodied AI systems. The models and code are openly shared for further exploration.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing LDA topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs) during Initialization and Post-Correction phases. Initialization with LLMs underperformed, but Post-Correction showed significant improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of LDA’s reliance on effective initialization and investigate the potential of LLMs to enhance its performance.

Method: The study integrates LLMs into two LDA phases: (1) Initialization (topic clustering for Gibbs sampling) and (2) Post-Correction, with extensive experimental evaluation.

Result: LLM-guided initialization showed no notable improvement upon convergence and had the worst performance compared to baselines. LLM-enabled Post-Correction, however, increased topic coherence by 5.86%.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of LLMs in refining topic models during Post-Correction, challenging assumptions about the universal superiority of LLMs over traditional techniques.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in text-based emotion detection across diverse languages, particularly in low-resource settings, with an emphasis on scalability and computational efficiency.

Method: A feature-centric framework is developed, dynamically adapting representations and learning algorithms to optimize performance in 28 languages, using tools like TF-IDF, contextual embeddings (FastText, Sentence-BERT), and dimensionality reduction (PCA).

Result: TF-IDF is found highly effective for low-resource languages, while advanced embeddings exhibit language-specific strengths; PCA aids in reducing training time, and computational efficiency analysis highlights trade-offs between model complexity and cost.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable approach for multilingual emotion detection, effectively tackling linguistic diversity and resource constraints, and balancing performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

### [73] [DocPolarBERT: A Pre-trained Model for Document Understanding with Relative Polar Coordinate Encoding of Layout Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08606)
*Benno Uthayasooriyar,Antoine Ly,Franck Vermet,Caio Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduction of DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document understanding using relative polar coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To remove the dependency on absolute 2D positional embeddings and improve efficiency in document understanding models.

Method: Extending self-attention mechanisms to utilize text block positions in a relative polar coordinate system.

Result: DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results despite smaller pre-training data.

Conclusion: A well-designed attention mechanism can offset the need for extensive pre-training data in document understanding.

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document
understanding that eliminates the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings.
We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative
polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being
pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used
IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results
demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for
reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for
document understanding.

### [74] [A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621)
*Marcin Pietroń,Rafał Olszowski,Jakub Gomułka,Filip Gampel,Andrzej Tomski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines LLM performance for argument mining using datasets like Args.me and UKP, showing GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 excel but still have errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gaps in research regarding LLM performance on publicly available argument classification databases.

Method: Testing various LLMs, including GPT variants, Llama, and DeepSeek, enhanced with reasoning algorithms like Chain-of-Thoughts, across diverse datasets.

Result: ChatGPT-4o is the top performer in general benchmarks, while Deepseek-R1 excels when reasoning capabilities are included.

Conclusion: Despite significant advancements by top models, errors persist, and the study highlights weaknesses and improvement pathways for both models and datasets.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

### [75] [The Impact of Automatic Speech Transcription on Speaker Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08660)
*Cristina Aggazzotti,Matthew Wiesner,Elizabeth Allyn Smith,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates speaker attribution's resiliency to transcription errors, finding that automatic transcripts (from ASR systems) can be equally or more effective than human transcriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding how well speaker attribution works when using automatic (error-prone) speech transcripts, a real-world scenario where human-transcribed data is often unavailable or impractical.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive analysis of speaker attribution performance using automatically transcribed speech (ASR) and evaluated the effects of transcription errors and ASR system properties on the attribution.

Result: The results reveal that speaker attribution is robust against transcription errors. Further, ASR errors may even highlight speaker-specific linguistic traits, leading to comparable or superior performance than human transcriptions.

Conclusion: Speaker attribution using ASR transcripts is practical and effective, with less reliance on perfect transcription. This opens new opportunities for speaker identification in settings where only ASR data is accessible.

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

### [76] [KELPS: A Framework for Verified Multi-Language Autoformalization via Semantic-Syntactic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08665)
*Jiyao Zhang,Chengli Zhong,Hui Xu,Qige Li,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic framework called KELPS to improve the translation of informal math into formal languages by generating a multilingual corpus and achieving superior accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for formalizing informal mathematics face limitations due to inadequate multilingual parallel corpora, requiring an innovative approach to enhance both quality and quantity.

Method: The KELPS framework first translates natural language into "Knowledge Equations" (KEs), grounded in assertional logic, and then converts them into formal languages like Lean, Coq, and Isabelle through well-defined rules, creating a 60,000-problem corpus.

Result: KELPS achieves a syntactic accuracy of 88.9% (pass@1) on the MiniF2F benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-V3 (81%) and Herald (81.3%).

Conclusion: The KELPS framework effectively addresses data limitations in formalizing mathematics, offering a robust solution that advances the field with superior accuracy.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

### [77] [KG-Attention: Knowledge Graph-Guided Attention at Test-Time via Bidirectional Information Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08704)
*Songlin Zhai,Guilin Qi,Yuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a test-time knowledge graph-augmented framework using a knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module for dynamic knowledge fusion, avoiding parameter updates and enabling real-time knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-enhanced methods for large language models rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, leading to limitations like catastrophic forgetting, reduced generalization, and poor adaptability to real-time knowledge updates.

Method: The paper proposes a knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module that integrates knowledge dynamically during test-time via two pathways: outward aggregation for dynamic input-driven KG fusion and inward aggregation for KG-guided filtering, forming a closed-loop enhancement with no parameter adjustments required.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the KGA module in achieving comparable performance for dynamic and test-time knowledge integration.

Conclusion: The KGA framework enables real-time and parameter-free test-time knowledge fusion, addressing the shortcomings of traditional KG-enhanced LLM approaches while maintaining generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

### [78] [KV Cache Steering for Inducing Reasoning in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08799)
*Max Belitsky,Dawid J. Kopiczko,Michael Dorkenwald,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cache steering is a method to influence language models through one-shot key-value cache interventions, improving reasoning without fine-tuning or prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often require continuous intervention or fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and practicality, motivating a simpler, lightweight approach.

Method: Cache steering uses GPT-4-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that guide models toward explicit, multi-step reasoning.

Result: The method enhances both the reasoning structure and quantitative performance on reasoning benchmarks, outperforming prior techniques in stability and inference-time efficiency.

Conclusion: Cache steering shows promise as a more practical and robust approach for controlled language model behaviors through one-shot interventions.

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for agricultural image analysis, achieving significant improvements in disease diagnosis, symptom analysis, and treatment recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle to perform effectively in specialized agricultural domains, yet accurate image analysis is crucial for precision agriculture.

Method: The framework introduces a prompt-based expert evaluation protocol and a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism to enhance diagnosis accuracy using domain-adapted embeddings.

Result: The proposed approach boosts diagnostic accuracy from 82.2% to 87.8%, symptom analysis from 38.9% to 52.2%, and treatment recommendation from 27.8% to 43.3%.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates VLM enhancement strategies that are deployable on mobile devices, offering reliable tools for precision agriculture in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [82] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for evaluating Text-to-Image models based on their adherence to text prompts and evaluates multiple models, revealing significant limitations in generating binary images with specific variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image models have gained prominence, but their performance and robustness are under-researched compared to text-only LLMs, necessitating an evaluation framework that assesses their reliability in adhering to prompts.

Method: Developed a dataset to test the models' adherence to text prompts, utilized gpt-4o to generate ground-truth image descriptions, and established a pipeline to compare descriptions of generated images with input prompts.

Result: Findings reveal that models, including variants of Stable Diffusion and Janus, fail to generate simple binary images following explicit input variations, and pre-trained VAEs show the generated images do not follow the dataset distribution.

Conclusion: The research highlights significant limitations in current Text-to-Image models and emphasizes the need for improved methods to evaluate and enhance their adherence to input text prompts.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven weight initialization method (CNTLoRA) for fine-tuning foundation models, improving convergence and performance by addressing LoRA weight initialization through domain shift constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models often rely on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques which suffer from limitations due to random initialization of LoRA weights. The authors aim to improve performance and convergence by addressing this gap.

Method: The proposed CNTLoRA method uses pre-training weights and fine-tuning activations to compute LoRA weights via a data-driven, closed-form estimation, requiring no training during initialization and allowing variable rank decomposition.

Result: Through experiments on tasks like image generation, classification, and understanding, CNTLoRA demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional and other data-driven initialization methods.

Conclusion: CNTLoRA offers a more efficient and effective initialization approach for LoRA fine-tuning, yielding faster convergence, enhanced performance, and valuable insights for optimal design in PEFT frameworks.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) is introduced for image classification, particularly applied to UAV tasks, demonstrating better efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance image classification methods for both benchmark and UAV applications using innovative approaches to feature extraction and classification.

Method: The method uses ELM-based autoencoder for unsupervised feature extraction in a hierarchical framework and a Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM for supervised classification.

Result: HML-ELM outperforms existing methods like ML-ELM, ML-FELM, and ELM in benchmark image classification tasks and UAV-based object transport experiments.

Conclusion: HML-ELM is a highly efficient image classification methodology, showcasing its robustness in practical and experimental applications.

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the performance of denoising algorithms based on diffusion models when applied to non-Gaussian noise distributions, using experiments on basic hardware and small images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether diffusion-based denoising algorithms, typically designed for Gaussian noise, can handle other types of noise distributions effectively.

Method: Experiments were conducted by applying the existing algorithm without modifications to various non-Gaussian noise distributions (e.g., uniform, Beta, or bimodal noise). Analysis was performed using small-scale image processing on standard laptops.

Result: The performance of the algorithm with non-Gaussian noise is studied and compared to its performance with Gaussian noise, indicating limitations and potential insights.

Conclusion: The results underline the dependence of these algorithms on Gaussian noise models and raise questions about their adaptability to other noise distributions.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Deep Learning-based method for estimating building heights using high-resolution SAR imagery, achieving promising results in diverse geographic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building height estimation is critical for various urban applications but challenging when generalizing across diverse geographic regions.

Method: A Deep Learning object-based regression model is applied to SAR imagery, incorporating bounding box detection and height estimation, trained on multi-continental data with cross-validation.

Result: The model performs well, with exemplary accuracy in European cities (MAE: 2.20 m in Munich), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in out-of-distribution scenarios, though variability remains in other regions.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of Deep Learning for robust global transfer learning in urban building height estimation using VHR SAR data.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building

*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS is a novel method for reconstructing scenes from sparse, unposed images using a 3D Gaussian registration-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods fall short when dealing with sparse views or incorporating additional input views, presenting the need for better techniques to tackle these challenges.

Method: RegGS uses an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to align local 3D Gaussian mixture models globally in Sim(3) space. Its framework combines optimal transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry for coarse-to-fine registration.

Result: RegGS achieves precise camera pose estimation, accurate 3D Gaussian alignment, and produces high-quality novel-view synthesis as demonstrated on benchmark datasets like RE10K and ACID.

Conclusion: RegGS overcomes the limitations of prior approaches, offering a robust solution for reconstructing unposed sparse views with improved accuracy and fidelity.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that addresses challenges of occlusion and temporal inconsistency using amodal completion and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods falter when handling occlusions and dynamic interactions due to assumptions of static objects or full visibility, necessitating a method to overcome these limitations.

Method: The framework employs amodal completion for inferring occluded regions and integrates temporal context for consistent reconstruction across video frames without relying on predefined templates.

Result: The approach, validated using 3D Gaussian Splatting, outperforms existing methods in precision, occlusion handling, and temporal stability on challenging monocular video datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the reconstruction of intricate dynamic scenes, offering improved robustness and detail recovery compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing to certify model predictions against adversarial examples by leveraging guided denoising diffusion models and privacy mechanisms, achieving improved accuracy under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve certification and robustness of vision model predictions against adversarial attacks, particularly under the $\ell_2$ threat model.

Method: The approach reinterprets guided denoising diffusion models as a series of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms, enabling end-to-end robustness analysis and certification.

Result: The method boosts both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet when applied under a specific guiding strategy.

Conclusion: By adapting guided denoising diffusion models, the proposed method provides provable certification and advances the robustness of vision models against adversarial examples.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research proposes a novel alert system for guiding visually impaired people in busy urban areas by leveraging lightweight models for real-time depth estimation and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals during urban commutes in Bangladesh, particularly due to frequent collisions and road accidents.

Method: The system employs transfer learning for training models in depth estimation and object detection, and optimizes them using quantization techniques for deployment on embedded systems.

Result: The system achieved a real-time lightweight model with an mAP50 score of 0.801, demonstrating effectiveness in depth estimation and object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a practical and efficient solution to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating urban environments safely, reducing risks of collisions.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [92] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HNOSeg-XS, an efficient and resolution-robust architecture for medical image segmentation, overcoming computational limitations of CNNs and transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional CNNs (restricted layers in 3D models and high memory requirements) and transformers (quadratic complexity). These challenges hinder resolution robustness and efficient medical image segmentation.

Method: The authors propose HNOSeg-XS, using Fourier neural operators reformulated with the Hartley transform for efficient, learnable partial differential equations. It addresses resolution limitations while being computationally and memory efficient.

Result: HNOSeg-XS demonstrated superior performance on benchmark datasets (BraTS'23, KiTS'23, MVSeg'23) with fewer parameters (< 34.7k), quicker inference time (< 0.24s), and lower memory usage (< 1.8 GiB) compared to CNNs and transformers.

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS offers a resolution-robust, highly efficient solution for medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional CNN and transformer approaches in terms of performance, memory, and computational cost.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining and balanced sampling were effective, but improvements in metadata selection and domain-adapted multi-modal learning are still needed.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), a smartphone-based tool to obtain clinically validated biomechanical measurements for healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in clinical practice caused by the lack of accessible and validated tools for objective movement measurement.

Method: The paper proposed a smartphone app with a novel algorithm to capture and analyze biomechanical data and validated its effectiveness using large datasets and clinical environments.

Result: The system demonstrated highly accurate joint angle measurements (errors within 3 degrees) across diverse clinical populations, along with reliability and sensitivity to clinical outcomes.

Conclusion: PBL can enhance mobility impairment monitoring by enabling scalable and easy-to-use biomechanical assessments, offering significant promise for clinical and rehabilitation practices.

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in SAR target detection caused by resolution discrepancies, proposing a novel model (CR-Net) that incorporates structural priors and evidential learning for better cross-resolution domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving SAR resolution benefits urban monitoring and target detection but introduces challenges in adapting models across varying resolution discrepancies.

Method: The CR-Net model features two core modules: SHFA (Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation) for structure-aware feature adaptation, and RSAA (Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment) for secure semantic alignment between domains.

Result: Experimental results indicate CR-Net improves cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and enhancing discriminability, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SAR target detection.

Conclusion: CR-Net demonstrates reliable cross-resolution detection and offers a solution to mitigate the blind feature adaptation and semantic propagation issues in SAR applications.

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

*Kui Jiang,Shiyu Liu,Junjun Jiang,Xin Yang,Hongxun Yang,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in audio-driven talking head generation by proposing M2DAO-Talker, which improves motion representation and video quality through a multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven talking head generation methods face issues like rendering artifacts and unstable motion fields, impeding their application in film production.

Method: The paper introduces M2DAO-Talker, employing a systematic three-step framework of video preprocessing, multi-granular motion representation (decoupling rigid and non-rigid motions), and rendering reconstruction with motion consistency constraints and alternating optimization.

Result: M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving generation quality by 2.43 dB (PSNR) and video realness by 0.64 (user evaluation), along with an inference speed of 150 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances video generation quality and realism, addressing key limitations in motion modeling and rendering for audio-driven talking heads, making it suitable for film production applications.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve craniofacial identification in forensic science using advancements in deep learning to connect skulls with corresponding faces.

Method: The framework utilizes convolutional Siamese networks trained on a cross-domain dataset of skull X-rays and optical facial images to learn a feature space that links similar data while separating dissimilar ones.

Result: The Siamese network successfully identified individuals from skull images with satisfactory results through experiments on a custom dataset of 40 volunteers.

Conclusion: The study shows the potential of convolutional Siamese networks for forensic craniofacial identification, even with a limited dataset.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Result: Experiments show the approach achieves high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across various medical image classification tasks.

Conclusion: The method enables the creation of lightweight, interpretable models for healthcare applications, facilitating their real-world use.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interpretability and compositionality of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) by addressing the reliance on auxiliary visual cues in generative CBMs.

Method: Proposed the CoCo-Bot model, which uses explicit concepts routed through diffusion-based energy functions, allowing for post-hoc interventions like concept composition and negation.

Result: Experimental results with StyleGAN2 on CelebA-HQ show that CoCo-Bot provides better concept-level control and interpretability while achieving competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot demonstrates the potential to maintain interpretable generative modeling without auxiliary cues, offering robust concept-level interventions and compositionality.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

*Jia-Xuan Jiang,Jiashuai Liu,Hongtao Wu,Yifeng Wu,Zhong Wang,Qi Bi,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing survival prediction models across different cancer types using multimodal data, introducing new methods to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal methods for survival prediction are cancer-type specific and lack generalization, which is crucial in real-world clinical applications.

Method: Two new modules, Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE), are proposed to improve multimodal robustness by enhancing weaker modalities and synthesizing domain distributions, respectively.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve generalization capabilities in cross-cancer scenarios, as demonstrated on a four-cancer-type benchmark.

Conclusion: The methods successfully address major challenges of multimodal integration and cross-cancer generalization, paving the way for robust clinical implementations.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Method: The authors propose MRAG, which integrates local (convolution) and global (transformer) feature extraction, uses multi-grained frequency decomposition, and incorporates a unique features angle-norm disentanglement loss to inject adversarial perturbations for stego generation.

Result: Experimental results show that MRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in balancing secret restorability, imperceptibility, and resistance against steganalysis.

Conclusion: MRAG demonstrates a robust capability to generate adversarial stego images that are more resistant to detection while maintaining message recovery and imperceptibility, marking an advancement in deep hiding techniques.

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a framework that boosts in-context learning for medical image segmentation. It addresses alignment issues between query images and in-context pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation across various imaging modalities is challenging due to limited annotated data and computational constraints of fine-tuning existing foundation models.

Method: CCV involves a cyclic process where the model generates a segmentation mask for a query image, swaps roles between the query and in-context pairs, and introduces query-specific prompts for improved alignment and self-verification.

Result: CCV was tested on seven medical datasets using two foundation ICL models, showcasing its effectiveness over existing methods in enhancing alignment and segmentation quality.

Conclusion: CCV improves the reliability and performance of in-context learning models in universal medical image segmentation, making it a promising solution despite data scarcity and fine-tuning limitations.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

*Yuki Yoshihara,Linjing Jiang,Nihan Karatas,Hitoshi Kanamori,Asuka Harada,Takahiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines the capability of ChatGPT-4o, a multimodal language model, to analyze traffic scenes for elderly driver assessments, showing that prompt design significantly impacts model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore if multimodal LLMs can reliably assist in human-like interpretations of traffic scenes, with a focus on elderly driver assessments—an area that demands contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.

Method: The researchers used zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting techniques to evaluate ChatGPT-4o on tasks like traffic density evaluation, intersection visibility assessment, and stop-sign recognition. Human annotations were used as a reference standard, and performance was measured using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Prompt design had a notable effect on results: for intersection visibility, recall improved from 21.7% to 57.0%, and for traffic density, agreement rose from 53.5% to 67.6%. Additionally, the model demonstrated high precision but lower recall in stop-sign detection.

Conclusion: With careful prompt engineering, multimodal LLMs show potential as tools for driving risk assessment. However, challenges remain, particularly in interpreting ambiguous scenes and improving recall rates. Future research should further test scalability, annotator diversity, and advanced model architectures.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

*Sen Wang,Shao Zeng,Tianjun Gu,Zhizhong Zhang,Ruixin Zhang,Shouhong Ding,Jingyun Zhang,Jun Wang,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU), integrating low-light image enhancement and understanding by using a novel paradigm powered by diffusion models and a technique called SCUF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited generalization and scalability in low-light enhancement methods and the lack of labeled data in low-light understanding tasks.

Method: The authors use pretrained generative diffusion models for zero-shot enhancement and propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF), which employs illumination-aware image prompts and a cycle-attention adapter, improving high-level and spatial semantics.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both image quality and downstream tasks such as classification, detection, and semantic segmentation on low-light datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating enhancement and understanding tasks through the GEFU paradigm shows promise for improving both visual quality and downstream AI performance, offering better scalability and generalization.

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing artwork datasets that lack robustness against artistic abstraction, diverse objects, and fine-grained object categories, thus improving computer vision applications in the humanities.

Method: The authors developed the ODOR dataset with extensive object-level annotations, statistical analyses of dataset properties, and baseline testing using object detection models.

Result: The dataset revealed challenging properties like dense and overlapping objects with detailed spatial distribution, offering insights into new challenges for object detection models.

Conclusion: ODOR dataset provides a valuable benchmark for challenging object detection in artworks, advancing research in computer vision and cultural heritage studies.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

*Zhanxin Gao,Beier Zhu,Liang Yao,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi achieves subject-consistent and pose-diverse text-to-image generation using a two-stage strategy that refines identity features during diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle to maintain consistent subject identity across diverse poses and layouts, limiting visual storytelling.

Method: Employs a two-stage process during diffusion: Identity Transport for pose-aware identity transfer and Identity Refinement for refining subject details.

Result: CoDi enhances subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity, outperforming existing methods in visual and metric-based evaluations.

Conclusion: CoDi offers an innovative framework for text-to-image generation, balancing subject consistency with pose and layout diversity effectively.

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch is a foundation model for two-frame correspondence matching tasks using a unified 2D displacement framework, eliminating the need for task-specific architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning, which lack versatility and generalization across correspondence tasks.

Method: Proposed a universal 2D displacement estimation model trained with features from Large Vision Models and pretrained on a large cross-domain dataset.

Result: PanMatch achieved state-of-the-art generalization, outperformed UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task evaluations, and demonstrated exceptional zero-shot performance in uncommon scenarios.

Conclusion: PanMatch provides a robust, versatile solution for various correspondence matching tasks and excels in cross-task and abnormal scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

*Li Chen,Rui Liu,Yuxiang Zhou,Xudong Ma,Yong Chen,Dell Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel deep hashing approach, SHC, that uses semantic relationships between classes to enhance image retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hashing methods often neglect semantic relationships by using data-independent algorithms, which can degrade retrieval performance.

Method: The authors propose SHC, a three-stage framework: (1) a classification network identifies semantic similarities, (2) an optimization algorithm generates semantic hash centers, and (3) a deep hashing network converts images into binary hash codes.

Result: SHC achieves significant performance improvements in large-scale image retrieval tasks, with average gains of +7.26% in MAP@100, +7.62% in MAP@1000, and +11.71% in MAP@ALL compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic relationships through SHC enhances the discriminability and retrieval quality of hash codes, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale retrieval.

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuGCP, a novel approach for conditional prompt learning to address challenges in adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt-learning methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with generalization to novel classes and lack effective cross-modal alignment, limiting performance.

Method: It proposes MuGCP, a framework leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create dynamic Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP), an AMG module for enhanced cross-modal interactions, and a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism.

Result: MuGCP demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models across 14 datasets.

Conclusion: MuGCP effectively integrates multi-modal knowledge to address limitations in prompt learning for VLMs, improving generalization and alignment.

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

TL;DR: InstaScene addresses challenges in enabling robots to perform holistic 3D scene perception by proposing methods for accurate decomposition and complete reconstruction of occluded instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with recognizing complete objects in cluttered environments due to treating scenes as indistinct wholes.

Method: InstaScene employs spatial contrastive learning for precise decomposition and in-situ generation for overcoming observational incompleteness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved decomposition accuracy and reconstruction fidelity for scenes with complex environments.

Conclusion: InstaScene successfully advances 3D perception capabilities by producing visually and geometrically accurate reconstructions of occluded objects.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a method that accelerates diffusion transformers by focusing on spatial dimensions, reducing computation time while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiency of diffusion transformers, which limits their real-world deployment despite their superior scalability in image and video generation.

Method: RALU uses a three-stage mixed-resolution sampling: 1) low-resolution latent denoising for semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive latent upsampling for artifact-prone areas at full resolution, and 3) full latent upsampling for refining detail, complemented by noise-timestep rescheduling to stabilize resolution transitions.

Result: RALU achieves up to 7.0× speed-up on FLUX and 3.0× on Stable Diffusion 3, with minimal degradation in image quality.

Conclusion: RALU offers a significant computational efficiency improvement and is compatible with existing temporal acceleration methods, enabling faster inference without affecting generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

*Ji Hyun Seo,Byounhyun Yoo,Gerard Jounghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 3D scene inpainting technique that ensures realistic and consistent results by leveraging a reference view and geometry reconstruction to tackle issues like detail loss and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene inpainting methods face challenges such as detail loss and perceptual inconsistencies when producing plausible content for occluded regions exposed by object removal.

Method: The proposed method uses a reference view to guide the inpainting process. It assesses inpainting similarity across views to adapt contributions for constructing accurate geometry. This geometry warps the reference view as pseudo-ground truth for optimizing consistency.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved geometric fidelity and appearance consistency for inpainted scenes in comparison to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses inconsistencies and detail loss in 3D scene inpainting, delivering more reliable and perceptually consistent results for complex scenes.

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VFMTok, an image tokenizer built using pre-trained vision foundation models, successfully enhancing image reconstruction, generation quality, and token efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore image tokenization atop pre-trained vision foundation models for improving image synthesis and generation, an area that has received limited attention.

Method: The method uses a pre-trained vision model as the encoder and introduces a region-adaptive quantization framework to reduce redundancy, along with a semantic reconstruction objective to preserve semantic fidelity.

Result: VFMTok improves autoregressive generation with a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet, achieves 3x faster model convergence, and enables high-quality class-conditional synthesis without classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a novel and effective way to leverage vision foundation models for image tokenization, offering substantial performance gains across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

*Wei Zhang,Yihang Wu,Songhua Li,Wenjie Ma,Xin Ma,Qiang Li,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews advancements in deep learning-based 3D reconstruction, focusing on feed-forward models like DUSt3R, which simplify workflows and improve robustness compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional 3D reconstruction methods such as complexity, high computational costs, and poor performance in texture-less regions.

Method: The feed-forward approach employs a unified deep network to simultaneously infer camera poses and dense geometry using Transformer-based correspondence modeling and scalability techniques.

Result: The feed-forward models are presented as more robust, efficient, and capable of handling challenging scenarios compared to traditional pipelines and older learning-based methods.

Conclusion: This survey highlights the transformative potential of feed-forward models in 3D reconstruction and identifies future challenges such as improving accuracy, scalability, and dynamic scene handling.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

### [119] [A document is worth a structured record: Principled inductive bias design for document recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08458)
*Benjamin Meyer,Lukas Tuggener,Sascha Hänzi,Daniel Schmid,Erdal Ayfer,Benjamin F. Grewe,Ahmed Abdulkadir,Thilo Stadelmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to document recognition by framing it as a transcription task, leveraging intrinsic document-specific structures and integrating inductive biases for enhanced end-to-end systems. It successfully transcribes documents like sheet music and engineering drawings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of current state-of-the-art document recognition systems, which neglect intrinsic document-type-specific structures and rely on sub-optimal heuristic post-processing. This makes many complex or less common document types inaccessible to modern recognition methodologies.

Method: The paper proposes using document-type-specific inductive biases, embedded into end-to-end machine learning systems. These biases align with the structural properties of documents and are implemented through a base transformer architecture adapted to different structures, such as graph structures for engineering drawings.

Result: The proposed system demonstrates effectiveness in experiments with progressively complex document structures, transcribing various document types, such as sheet music, shape drawings, and engineering drawings. Notably, it achieves the first end-to-end transcription of engineering drawings.

Conclusion: The approach provides a framework for designing document recognition systems for complex or unconventional document types and guides the development of unified document foundation models. This represents a significant advancement over standard recognition tasks like OCR and OMR.

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

### [120] [F3-Net: Foundation Model for Full Abnormality Segmentation of Medical Images with Flexible Input Modality Requirement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08460)
*Seyedeh Sahar Taheri Otaghsara,Reza Rahmanzadeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F3-Net is a model for medical image segmentation, excelling in robustness and generalizability across modalities and pathologies, without relying on retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical image segmentation related to multimodal input reliance, task specificity, and generalization.

Method: Utilizes synthetic modality training with a zero-image strategy to handle missing MRI inputs, surpassing traditional synthesis techniques.

Result: Achieved top performance on multiple datasets (BraTS, ISLES) and resiliently handles domain shifts and clinical variability.

Conclusion: F3-Net is a scalable and versatile model for bridging research and clinical applications, providing robust segmentation capability.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research
and practical clinical deployment.

### [121] [Dual Dimensions Geometric Representation Learning Based Document Dewarping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08492)
*Heng Li,Qingcai Chen,Xiangping Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces D2Dewarp, a document image dewarping model that focuses on dual dimensions (horizontal and vertical) of distortion perception. It achieves state-of-the-art results and releases a new dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document dewarping methods limit their focus to the horizontal dimension, missing finer-grained distortions in vertical directions.

Method: The paper proposes D2Dewarp, which uses dual-dimensional distortion perception with a fusion module based on X and Y coordinates to enhance feature interaction. It also introduces a new dataset with fine-grained annotations for training.

Result: D2Dewarp outperforms state-of-the-art models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation on public Chinese and English benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging a dual-dimensional approach with effective feature fusion, the proposed method advances document image dewarping and sets a new benchmark, with public release of the dataset and code for further research.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

Abstract: This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people
tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying
on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that
aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless
information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling,
the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new
large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene
reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with
flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be
publicly released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

### [123] [Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation for Occluded Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08520)
*Yufei Zheng,Wenjun Wang,Wenjun Gan,Jiawei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OGFR, a novel method leveraging occlusion-aware Vision Transformers and reinforced knowledge distillation for improving occluded person re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in occluded person re-identification, such as diverse occlusion scenarios and feature contamination from holistic images.

Method: The proposed OGFR method uses a teacher-student distillation architecture combined with a Vision Transformer and reinforcement learning to purify features and enhance occlusion representation.

Result: The method allows robust feature representation in occlusion scenarios by employing occlusion pattern modeling and purified knowledge transfer between holistic and occluded branches.

Conclusion: OGFR successfully mitigates limitations in existing methods, enabling accurate re-identification in occluded images through innovative purification techniques and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval is a 3D content-based image retrieval system combining radiomics descriptors and deep learning to enhance medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for medical image retrieval are mainly focused on 2D images and require fully annotated inputs, which limits their clinical flexibility.

Method: RadiomicsRetrieval integrates handcrafted radiomics features with deep learning embeddings using a promptable segmentation model. Tumor embeddings are aligned with radiomics features through contrastive learning, enhanced with anatomical positional embedding (APE).

Result: The framework demonstrated improved retrieval specificity in lung CT and brain MRI datasets by leveraging radiomics features and APE for better anatomical context.

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval offers a flexible, low-overhead solution for medical image retrieval, supporting diverse clinical scenarios like diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

*Alen Adamyan,Tomáš Čížek,Matej Straka,Klara Janouskova,Martin Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using reinforcement learning to optimize memory updates in the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in handling object tracking challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address limitations in SAM 2, especially when dealing with distractors, occlusions, and object motion during visual object tracking, using a novel approach instead of heuristic-based solutions.

Method: The paper introduces reinforcement learning to frame memory control in SAM 2 as a sequential decision-making problem, enabling the optimization of memory updates with a separate agent per video.

Result: The reinforcement learning-based approach achieves more than three times the improvement over SAM 2 compared to heuristic methods, showcasing the efficacy of this novel method.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning reveals untapped potential in SAM 2’s memory bank and serves as a promising alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory management in visual object tracking.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

### [126] [Image Translation with Kernel Prediction Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08554)
*Cristina Mata,Michael S. Ryoo,Henrik Turbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the domain gap issue in semantic segmentation when using synthetic datasets by proposing a novel unpaired image translation method, DA-KPN, to improve semantic matching and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges posed by the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets in semantic segmentation, as current methods using GANs do not ensure pixel-level semantic matching, impacting segmentation accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, DA-KPN, estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters for a simple image translation function and employs multi-scale discriminators to ensure transformations are realistic, maintaining semantic consistency.

Result: DA-KPN outperformed traditional GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation, especially in low-data scenarios, and showed comparable results on face parsing tasks.

Conclusion: DA-KPN provides a more semantically consistent and realistic image translation method, improving segmentation performance and addressing limitations in existing GAN-based approaches.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

*Enyu Liu,En Yu,Sijia Chen,Wenbing Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DISC, a dual-stream method optimizing class-level and voxel-level features for 3D Semantic Scene Completion, achieving state-of-the-art results using single-frame input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of voxel-based methods in utilizing class-level information, which is critical for fine-grained 3D scene completion.

Method: DISC employs a dual-stream paradigm with class-specific queries and specialized decoding modules to enhance class-level interactions and optimize instance and scene categories separately.

Result: DISC achieved state-of-the-art mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55 on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks. It also outperformed existing methods in instance category performance, even with single-frame input.

Conclusion: DISC demonstrates the effectiveness of disentangling instance and scene contexts for improved 3D semantic scene completion, setting a new performance benchmark.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Result: The proposed framework reached an average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.8256mm, surpassing existing models like SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D U-Net.

Conclusion: The study shows that the integration of semantic fusion and bidirectional interactive attention enhances segmentation accuracy, setting a benchmark for clinical knowledge incorporation in medical imaging.

Abstract: This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain
tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal
Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text
descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

*Shuang Cui,Jinglin Xu,Yi Li,Xiongxin Tang,Jiangmeng Li,Jiahuan Zhou,Fanjiang Xu,Fuchun Sun,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BayesTTA, a Bayesian adaptation method designed to address gradual temporal distribution shifts in test-time adaptation scenarios. It ensures consistent predictions and evolves visual representations without storing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, which struggle with temporal distribution shifts seen in real-world scenarios such as illumination or seasonal changes.

Method: BayesTTA leverages class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions, statistical hypothesis testing for covariance structure selection, Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) for inference, and self-paced adaptation of normalization layers to ensure efficient and stable performance.

Result: BayesTTA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across four temporally evolving datasets and also generalizes well on ten standard TTA datasets.

Conclusion: BayesTTA introduces a novel solution for gradual temporal adaptation challenges, providing improved performance and efficiency without relying on raw data storage.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

TL;DR: This study evaluates the Document Attention Network (DAN) for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan handwritten birth certificates, focusing on efficient annotation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to facilitate the automatic transcription of handwritten documents, especially Uruguayan birth certificates, and to determine effective annotation strategies while minimizing training effort.

Method: The authors used the Document Attention Network (DAN) and analyzed two annotation strategies (normalized and diplomatic) across two datasets with 201 birth certificate scans handwritten by over 15 writers.

Result: Normalized annotation outperforms for standardizable fields (e.g., dates and places of birth), while diplomatic annotation yields better results for non-standardizable fields (e.g., names and surnames).

Conclusion: Choosing appropriate annotation methods for different field types can significantly enhance handwriting transcription using DAN.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, outperforming existing methods like SOLOFusion.

Conclusion: OnlineBEV effectively improves temporal 3D perception performance while optimizing memory usage and achieving significant accuracy gains in camera-based 3D object detection tasks.

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

*Haoran Sun,Haoyu Bian,Shaoning Zeng,Yunbo Rao,Xu Xu,Lin Mei,Jianping Gou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DatasetAgent, a multi-agent system that uses multi-modal large language models and image optimization tools to efficiently auto-construct high-quality image datasets from real-world images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual collection and annotation of image datasets are inefficient and time-consuming. The paper aims to address this inefficiency by proposing a scalable automated method to construct high-quality datasets from real-world images.

Method: The researchers designed DatasetAgent, a collaborative system comprising four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and specialized image optimization tools. This system creates image datasets tailored to user requirements and supports expanding existing datasets or creating new ones.

Result: Experiments showed that DatasetAgent successfully created multiple image datasets which were used to train vision models for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation with satisfactory performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DatasetAgent system effectively automates the dataset construction process, offering a tool for generating high-quality image datasets from real-world sources, thereby improving efficiency and scalability in building datasets for vision applications.

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

### [133] [Generalizable 7T T1-map Synthesis from 1.5T and 3T T1 MRI with an Efficient Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08655)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Tonghe Wang,Vanessa Wildman,David S. Yu,Hui Mao,Erik Middlebrooks,Aparna Kesewala,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces 7T-Restormer, a transformer-based model for synthesizing ultra-high-field (7T) MRI T1-maps from 1.5T and 3T T1-weighted images, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of high cost, limited availability, and susceptibility artifacts of 7T MRI by providing a solution to synthesize comparable 7T-quality images from more common field strengths (1.5T, 3T).

Method: The model was trained and validated on a dataset of T1-weighted MRI from 141 patients, paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps. A total of 32,128 slices were divided into training, validation, and test datasets. Performance was benchmarked against ResViT and ResShift models.

Result: 7T-Restormer achieved a PSNR of 26 dB, SSIM of 0.861-0.866, and NMSE of 0.019, showing substantial improvements (up to 64% lower NMSE) over competing models while using significantly fewer parameters (10.5M vs up to 70.4M). Mixed-field training yielded better results than training on a single field.

Conclusion: The proposed 7T-Restormer model effectively generates high-quality synthetic 7T MP2RAGE maps, enabling broader accessibility of 7T imaging benefits in standard clinical workflows by leveraging commonplace MRI machines (1.5T, 3T).

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ByDeWay is a training-free framework using depth-aware prompting to improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning and grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of MLLMs in spatial reasoning and hallucination by developing a lightweight, training-free enhancement strategy.

Method: Introduces Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which uses monocular depth estimation to segment scenes into layers and generate depth-aware captions appended to the input prompt for MLLMs.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in spatial grounding and response quality on benchmarks such as POPE and GQA, across multiple MLLMs.

Conclusion: Depth-aware prompting enhances MLLM performance in a modular and lightweight manner, demonstrating significant benefits without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoSAiC, a framework for contrastive learning in Earth System Observation, addressing challenges like high-class similarity and clutter, and achieving superior results on satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance representation learning in Earth System Observation, which involves diverse satellite modalities and challenges like multi-label alignment, scene clutter, and inter-class similarity.

Method: The proposed framework, MoSAiC, integrates intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery.

Result: MoSAiC outperforms existing fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization on benchmark datasets like BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS.

Conclusion: MoSAiC demonstrates its potential for finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning in challenging multi-modal satellite imagery scenarios.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a training-free muscle segmentation method using keypoint tracking and optical flow, achieving comparable accuracy to CNNs with lower computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in automated MRI segmentation: high computational cost, reliance on training data, and issues with smaller muscle segmentation.

Method: Introduced a training-free approach combining keypoint selection and Lucas-Kanade optical flow for segmentation.

Result: Achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.6 to 0.7, matching state-of-the-art CNN models with reduced computational needs.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable, interpretable alternative for muscle segmentation, suitable for clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces L-CLIPScore, a lightweight, embedding-based captioning metric derived from CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an efficient metric to evaluate and train captioning models while reducing computational cost.

Method: L-CLIPScore leverages compression techniques like weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition, along with a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss for distillation.

Result: L-CLIP achieves comparable performance to CLIP with reduced computation resources, and L-CLIPScore proves effective for caption evaluation.

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore works best as a judge for captions when mixed with n-gram metrics; it faces challenges when solely used for training.

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGPMIL, a probabilistic attention-based MIL framework using Sparse Gaussian Processes, addressing uncertainty in instance-level relevance for digital pathology datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deterministic attention-based MIL methods in digital pathology overlook uncertainty in instance relevance despite delivering strong bag-level performance.

Method: A Sparse Gaussian Process-based posterior distribution is used to quantify uncertainty in attention scores, incorporating feature scaling to speed up training and improve efficiency.

Result: SGPMIL achieves competitive bag-level performance alongside enhanced interpretability, reliability, and quality of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in digital pathology datasets, improving predictions and training efficiency, and sets a new benchmark for probabilistic MIL approaches.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoundaboutHD, a high-resolution, real-world benchmark dataset for multi-camera vehicle tracking to address existing gaps in smart city applications like anomaly detection and traffic density estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current publicly available datasets for multi-camera vehicle tracking are inadequate for real-world applications because of oversimplified scenarios, poor resolution, and limited diversity.

Method: The authors designed and introduced RoundaboutHD, a 40-minute dataset with footage captured by four non-overlapping high-resolution cameras and annotated with 512 unique vehicle identities for comprehensive analysis.

Result: Baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking were provided, with supporting evaluation code publicly accessible.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD bridges the gap between academic research and real-world multi-camera vehicle tracking scenarios, offering enhanced challenges for further research in smart city applications.

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features to address insufficient training data in machine learning for computer vision, achieving better results than deep learning and Radiomics methods for a medical imaging problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of limited training data in solving computer vision problems, particularly in complex medical imaging contexts.

Method: The authors use spectral total-variation (STV) features known for their texture characterization, creating lowly correlated weak learners for ensemble models, and validate their approach on medical imaging data.

Result: On a dataset of CT and PET scans with 1524 pairs, their STV-based ensemble gained an AUC of 0.87, outperforming deep learning (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79).

Conclusion: STV-based ensembles are proven effective particularly in capturing fine-grain information in CT images, offering a robust solution for specific medical imaging prediction tasks.

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles challenges in hierarchical land cover and use (LCLU) classification by introducing HieraRS and TransLU, novel approaches for improved multi-granularity predictions and cross-domain adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses two key limitations of existing deep-learning LCLU models: reliance on flat classification methods that fail to capture hierarchical predictions, and difficulties in transferring these models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies.

Method: The authors propose HieraRS, utilizing a Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM) for generating semantic, hierarchical predictions. They also introduce TransLU, a dual-branch framework featuring Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA), for effective domain transfer.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate improved classification accuracy, semantic consistency, adaptability to cross-domain tasks, and dynamic category expansion. Additionally, the authors develop MM-5B, a large-scale, pixel-annotated LCLU dataset.

Conclusion: HieraRS and TransLU significantly enhance the flexibility, accuracy, and generalization of LCLU classification models, paving the way for more practical applications across diverse domains.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT is a framework integrating lane detection, synchronization, and learning strategies for transportation Digital Twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for transportation Digital Twins struggle with scalability, adaptability, privacy, and computational efficiency.

Method: Developed Geo-ORBIT using a lightweight lane detection model, federated meta-learning, and integration with simulation environments like CARLA.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane outperformed alternatives in geometric accuracy and generalization while reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: The work establishes a context-aware and scalable modeling approach for dynamic roadway geometry in transportation Digital Twins.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly

Method: The authors propose Hyper-Compression, which transforms high-dimensional parameter vectors into low-dimensional scalars, and introduce a HyperLinear operator to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication for faster inference.

Result: Birkhoff achieves a 5.17x compression ratio on SAM2-B with less than 1% performance drop, completing the compression process within 60 seconds on all tested models.

Conclusion: Birkhoff demonstrates consistent and competitive results in model compression, making it a practical solution for compressing SAMs efficiently without compromising performance.

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a hybrid model combining CNNs and a Hopfield network for handwritten digit classification, achieving 99.2% accuracy on MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of intraclass variability in handwritten digit recognition while offering interpretability in the model through an energy-based decision process.

Method: It extracts features using CNNs, clusters them using k-means into class-specific prototypes, and employs a multi-well Hopfield network to classify by minimizing an energy function.

Result: The model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on the MNIST dataset, showing its robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach demonstrates the synergy of CNNs for feature extraction and Hopfield networks for classification, offering both high accuracy and a potential framework for broader pattern recognition tasks.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

TL;DR: NeuralOS is a neural framework simulating operating system GUIs by predicting screen frames in response to user actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance human-computer interaction by creating a fully adaptive neural interface capable of simulating OS GUIs effectively.

Method: NeuralOS uses an RNN to track OS state combined with a diffusion-based renderer for screen image generation, trained on Ubuntu XFCE data of varied user interactions.

Result: NeuralOS simulates realistic GUI sequences, captures mouse interactions effectively, and predicts application launches accurately, but struggles with precise keyboard input modeling.

Conclusion: NeuralOS represents progress towards generative neural interfaces, though challenges remain for fine-grained input modeling.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPart, a part-aware 3D diffusion framework designed to improve control and detail in 3D object generation by decomposing objects into part latents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D object generation methods fail to capture detailed, compositional geometries and offer limited fine-grained control.

Method: Proposes a part-aware framework (CoPart) that decomposes 3D objects into part-based representations and employs a mutual guidance strategy for joint latent denoising. Partverse, a new dataset, is also introduced.

Result: CoPart achieves superior part-level editing, articulated object generation, and compositional scene creation with improved controllability.

Conclusion: CoPart improves 3D generation by reducing encoding complexity, modeling part relationships, and enabling part-level control, filling gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

*Zhengqing Wang,Yuefan Wu,Jiacheng Chen,Fuyang Zhang,Yasutaka Furukawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLiFT, a neural rendering approach that uses compressed light-field tokens for efficient and flexible scene rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compute-efficient and adaptive rendering while maintaining high-quality scene representation and flexibility in resource usage.

Method: Images with camera poses are tokenized via a multi-view encoder, reduced using latent-space K-means, and compressed into CLiFTs using a multi-view "condenser." These tokens are used for compute-adaptive rendering at test time.

Result: The method achieves significant data reduction while delivering comparable rendering quality and achieving the highest overall rendering score on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets.

Conclusion: CLiFT provides an effective balance between data size, rendering quality, and speed, showcasing promising potential for resource-efficient neural rendering.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

### [149] [Lumos-1: On Autoregressive Video Generation from a Unified Model Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08801)
*Hangjie Yuan,Weihua Chen,Jun Cen,Hu Yu,Jingyun Liang,Shuning Chang,Zhihui Lin,Tao Feng,Pengwei Liu,Jiazheng Xing,Hao Luo,Jiasheng Tang,Fan Wang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lumos-1, a novel autoregressive video generator built on standard large language model (LLM) architectures. It minimizes architectural changes and integrates efficient methods like MM-RoPE and AR-DF to handle spatiotemporal data and address frame-wise loss imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues with existing autoregressive video generators, such as divergence from standard LLMs, dependence on external encoders, and high latency, while making video generation more efficient and aligned with LLM paradigms.

Method: Lumos-1 retains the LLM architecture and introduces innovations like MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal correlations and AR-DF for addressing frame-wise loss imbalance. Additionally, it employs memory-efficient training techniques using 48 GPUs.

Result: Lumos-1 achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models like EMU3, COSMOS-Video2World, and OpenSoraPlan on benchmark tests, demonstrating its effectiveness in video generation.

Conclusion: Lumos-1 successfully unifies autoregressive video generation with LLM architectures, solving critical issues in spatiotemporal modeling and training inefficiencies. Its contributions pave the way for efficient and scalable video generation models.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Lumos.

*Ahmad Zaki Akmal,Azkario Rizky Pratama,Guntur Dharma Putra*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-layer architecture for Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) web services to resolve security and latency issues, achieving responsiveness under 200ms while maintaining strong security guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive user experiences in BFT systems are hindered by high latency, which limits their applicability in critical applications like supply chain management and metaverse environments.

Method: The paper introduces a two-layer architecture with a session-aware transaction buffer (Layer 2) offering immediate feedback and a traditional BFT consensus layer (Layer 1) for periodic tamper-proof operation finalizations.

Result: Layer 2 operations were shown to be four times faster than the corresponding Layer 1 processes, with minimal compromise on transaction integrity. The system supports responsive interactions in latency-sensitive applications.

Conclusion: This architecture makes BFT systems practical for domains requiring both immediate feedback and strong integrity, addressing latency challenges effectively.

Abstract: Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) web services provide critical integrity
guarantees for distributed applications but face significant latency challenges
that hinder interactive user experiences. We propose a novel two-layer
architecture that addresses this fundamental tension between security and
responsiveness in BFT systems. Our approach introduces a session-aware
transaction buffer layer (Layer 2) that delivers immediate feedback to users
through consensus simulation, while periodically committing batched operations
to a fully Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus layer (Layer 1). By separating
interactive operations from consensus finalization, our system achieves
responsive user experiences of under 200ms, while maintaining strong BFT
security guarantees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture through a
supply chain management implementation, where operators require both immediate
feedback during multi-step workflows and tamper-proof record keeping. Our
evaluation shows that our Layer 2 operations perform four times faster than the
Layer 1 counterpart, while substantially preserving the end-to-end transaction
integrity. Our approach enables BFT applications in domains previously
considered impractical due to latency constraints, such as metaverse
environments, where users require both responsive interaction and guaranteed
state consistency.

### [152] [Content-Oblivious Leader Election in 2-Edge-Connected Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08348)
*Yi-Jun Chang,Lyuting Chen,Haoran Zhou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents an asynchronous content-oblivious leader election algorithm that works in any 2-edge-connected network with quiescent termination and message complexity $O(m \cdot N \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$, refuting the conjecture that a predesignated leader is necessary for non-trivial computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in fully-defective asynchronous networks, where effective communication without a predesignated leader is conjectured to be impossible in certain settings.

Method: The authors designed a new algorithm for asynchronous leader election that quiescently terminates and incorporates properties of 2-edge-connected networks, leveraging a message complexity dependent on edges, nodes, and IDs.

Result: The proposed algorithm successfully achieves leader election in fully-defective asynchronous networks without requiring a predesignated leader, allowing subsequent simulation of noiseless algorithms.

Conclusion: This work entirely refutes the conjecture that a predesignated leader is necessary, showing that leader election and subsequent communication are feasible in fully-defective asynchronous networks under 2-edge-connected conditions.

Abstract: Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sela (PODC 2022 \& Distributed Computing
2023) studied fully-defective asynchronous networks, where communication
channels may suffer an extreme form of alteration errors, rendering messages
completely corrupted. The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation,
where nodes communicate solely via pulses. They showed that if the network is
2-edge-connected, then any algorithm for a noiseless setting can be simulated
in the fully-defective setting; otherwise, no non-trivial computation is
possible in the fully-defective setting. However, their simulation requires a
predesignated leader, which they conjectured to be necessary for any
non-trivial content-oblivious task.
  Recently, Frei, Gelles, Ghazy, and Nolin (DISC 2024) refuted this conjecture
for the special case of oriented ring topology. They designed two asynchronous
content-oblivious leader election algorithms with message complexity $O(n \cdot
\mathsf{ID}_{\max})$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\mathsf{ID}_{\max}$
is the maximum $\mathsf{ID}$. The first algorithm stabilizes in unoriented
rings without termination detection. The second algorithm quiescently
terminates in oriented rings, thus enabling the execution of the simulation
algorithm after leader election.
  In this work, we present an asynchronous content-oblivious leader election
algorithm that quiescently terminates in any 2-edge connected network with
message complexity $O(m \cdot N \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$, where $m$ is the
number of edges, $N$ is a known upper bound on the number of nodes, and
$\mathsf{ID}_{\min}$ is the smallest $\mathsf{ID}$. Combined with the previous
simulation result, our finding implies that any algorithm from the noiseless
setting can be simulated in the fully-defective setting without assuming a
preselected leader, entirely refuting the original conjecture.

*Dominik Schweisgut,Anne Benoit,Yves Robert,Henning Meyerhenke*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of reducing carbon emissions in computing centers by scheduling interdependent tasks (DAGs) during periods of higher renewable energy availability. It presents a heuristic framework, CaWoSched, which achieves notable emission reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the large energy consumption and carbon emissions caused by computing centers, specifically targeting the optimization of task scheduling to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy.

Method: The authors formalize the scheduling problem as a polynomial-time solvable case for single processors, while identifying it as NP-hard for multiple processors. They then develop a heuristic framework (CaWoSched), combining greedy methods and local search approaches. Comparisons are made against a baseline algorithm and an ILP-based exact solution.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that the proposed CaWoSched framework significantly reduces carbon emissions compared to the baseline scheduling method.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging smarter scheduling strategies such as those in CaWoSched can help integrate renewable energy more effectively in data centers, reducing their environmental impact.

Abstract: Large data and computing centers consume a significant share of the world's
energy consumption. A prominent subset of the workloads in such centers are
workflows with interdependent tasks, usually represented as directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs). To reduce the carbon emissions resulting from executing such
workflows in centers with a mixed (renewable and non-renewable) energy supply,
it is advisable to move task executions to time intervals with sufficient green
energy when possible. To this end, we formalize the above problem as a
scheduling problem with a given mapping and ordering of the tasks. We show that
this problem can be solved in polynomial time in the uniprocessor case. For at
least two processors, however, the problem becomes NP-hard. Hence, we propose a
heuristic framework called CaWoSched that combines several greedy approaches
with local search. To assess the 16 heuristics resulting from different
combinations, we also devise a simple baseline algorithm and an exact ILP-based
solution. Our experimental results show that our heuristics provide significant
savings in carbon emissions compared to the baseline.

*Ming Wang,Zhaoyang Duan,Dong Xue,Fangzhou Liu,Zhongheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with differential privacy to improve respiratory disease diagnosis under limited labeled data and privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited high-quality labeled medical datasets for respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained settings, and to ensure patient privacy in decentralized data environments.

Method: The paper introduces a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm to reduce overfitting due to limited data, employs differential privacy noise to safeguard against gradient leakage, and uses a weighted average algorithm for aggregating diagnostic models in a federated setting.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates strong performance in diagnosing respiratory diseases across diverse data structures and distributions, all while maintaining privacy through differential privacy mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study successfully combines federated learning, few-shot learning, and privacy preservation, presenting an effective and privacy-conscious approach to respiratory disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

TL;DR: This paper enhances the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for efficient hyperparameter optimization in combinatorial search spaces, introducing a generalized kernel and modifications to handle large search spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study recognizes that hyperparameter optimization (HPO) applications extend beyond deep learning, especially into domains like chemistry and biology, where combinatorial optimization is critical but underexplored in TPE.

Method: The authors generalize the categorical kernel with a numerical kernel in TPE to introduce a distance structure. They also propose modifications to handle large combinatorial search spaces by reducing the time complexity of kernel calculations.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated better optimization results with fewer evaluations in synthetic problem experiments, outperforming the original TPE.

Conclusion: The enhanced TPE algorithm broadens the scope of HPO to effectively tackle black-box combinatorial optimization problems, and it is implemented in the open-source framework, Optuna.

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal learning perspective for spatio-temporal anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, aiming to improve interpretability, adaptability, and robustness over existing black-box deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the resilience of increasingly interconnected and distributed cyber-physical systems against evolving cyberattacks is critical, yet current black-box deep learning models used for anomaly detection lack interpretability and robustness.

Method: The proposed approach focuses on causal graph profiling, multi-view data fusion, and continual causal graph learning to identify dynamic cause-effect structures for anomaly detection.

Result: The study demonstrates the advantages of causal models, such as providing early warning signals and root cause attribution in real-world systems like water treatment infrastructures.

Conclusion: The work sets a future agenda for scalable and adaptive causal anomaly detection frameworks, aiming to shift cybersecurity research towards causality-driven methods for better system resilience and explainability.

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO bridges the gap between online pointwise absolute reward alignment and offline learning methods by using quantile rewards to optimize KL-regularized RL objectives, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current RL methods that either require online adaptation or rely on relative reward signals, while introducing scalable and offline-compatible approaches to utilize pointwise absolute rewards.

Method: Quantile Reward Policy Optimization (QRPO) introduces quantile rewards for regression with analytically tractable KL-regularized RL objectives, enabling offline scalability and improved computation.

Result: QRPO outperforms baseline methods like DPO, REBEL, and SimPO on chat and coding evaluations, showcasing its scalability and top performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: QRPO simplifies pointwise reward alignment, scales well with computation, and avoids the biases induced by preferences or length biases during training.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

### [158] [Low-rank Momentum Factorization for Memory Efficient Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08091)
*Pouria Mahdavinia,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), a memory-efficient fine-tuning method for large foundation models, using dynamically updated low-rank momentum factorization with competitive performance and resource savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large models like LLMs is memory-intensive due to stateful optimizers, and alternatives like LoRA or gradient compression have their own limitations. There is a need for a scalable solution that mitigates memory challenges without significant computational trade-offs.

Method: The proposed MoFaSGD method uses a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation for the first-order momentum during training. This enables adaptive optimization subspace updates and efficient spectrally normalized updates, avoiding costly offline resampling and fixed subspaces.

Result: MoFaSGD achieves effective memory reduction comparable to parameter-efficient methods like LoRA while maintaining similar or better performance. It demonstrates theoretical convergence guarantees and is validated on large language model benchmarks for alignment.

Conclusion: MoFaSGD offers an optimized trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance in fine-tuning large-scale models, positioning itself as a viable, practical solution for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available

### [159] [PDE-aware Optimizer for Physics-informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08118)
*Hardik Shukla,Manurag Khullar,Vismay Churiwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a PDE-aware optimizer for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to address gradient misalignment in PDE-constrained systems, showing improved performance over existing methods (e.g., Adam, SOAP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimizers like Adam often struggle with balancing loss terms in PINNs, particularly for stiff or ill-conditioned PDE systems, motivating the need for a tailored optimization approach.

Method: The authors propose a PDE-aware optimizer that adapts parameter updates using the variance of per-sample PDE residual gradients, avoiding high computational costs associated with second-order optimizers like SOAP.

Result: The PDE-aware optimizer outperforms Adam and SOAP in solving 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn, and KdV equations, demonstrating smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, especially in regions with sharp gradients.

Conclusion: The PDE-aware optimizer effectively enhances PINNs training stability but requires further investigations for scalability on larger architectures and advanced hardware.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

*Tianchi Yu,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quasi-Random PINNs (QRPINNs), which utilize low-discrepancy sampling sequences to improve efficiency and accuracy in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance and sampling efficiency of traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), particularly in high-dimensional PDEs, by addressing their sensitivity to sampling methods.

Method: The method involves replacing random sampling in PINNs with low-discrepancy sequences, as inspired by quasi Monte-Carlo methods, to create QRPINNs. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments validate their efficiency and convergence.

Result: The results show that QRPINNs perform significantly better than PINNs and certain adaptive sampling methods, especially for high-dimensional PDEs. Combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling further boosts performance.

Conclusion: QRPINNs are proven to be a superior alternative to conventional PINNs, offering better convergence rates and higher accuracy, with potential gains when paired with adaptive sampling.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KKT-Hardnet is a new PINN architecture ensuring strict constraint satisfaction by using KKT conditions and log-exponential transformations for reliable hybrid modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle to strictly meet constraints, which is critical in engineering systems where slight violations can severely affect model reliability.

Method: KKT-Hardnet employs constraint satisfaction by solving KKT conditions for a projection approach. It uses log-exponential reformulation to create a sparse system with linear and exponential components, making the system differentiable.

Result: KKT-Hardnet outperforms conventional PINNs and multilayer perceptrons in accuracy and constraint satisfaction, as demonstrated in test cases and a real-world chemical process simulation.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet effectively integrates domain-specific knowledge into machine learning models, ensuring precision and improved reliability in complex system simulations.

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

TL;DR: This paper presents ALCo-FM, a model for traffic risk prediction using adaptive long-context multimodal reasoning and advanced model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic accidents, though infrequent, are significant events that necessitate advanced multimodal, long-context reasoning for reliable risk prediction.

Method: The authors developed ALCo-FM, which dynamically selects input context windows using a volatility pre-score, integrates multimodal data with shallow cross attention, and processes information using local GAT layers and a sparse BigBird transformer on H3 hexagonal grids. Monte Carlo dropout is applied for confidence estimation.

Result: ALCo-FM achieves exceptional performance on urban risk prediction tasks with metrics like 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1 score, and 0.04 ECE, outperforming over 20 existing models.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in urban risk prediction and addresses label imbalance with a class-weighted loss and fine-tuning. Its code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in
large-scale urban risk prediction. Code and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative method that avoids estimating density functions by using gradient descent to transform distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function estimation in generative models is computationally and statistically challenging, necessitating alternatives.

Method: The authors propose utilizing deterministic updates with inverse gradient descent, leveraging physics of interacting particles, to transport uniform distributions to data distributions.

Result: Theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrates the feasibility of this estimation-free generative method.

Conclusion: This approach offers an innovative, training-free generative model that eliminates the need for density function estimation and neural network training.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

### [164] [Just Read the Question: Enabling Generalization to New Assessment Items with Text Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08154)
*Arisha Khan,Nathaniel Li,Tori Shen,Anna N. Rafferty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Text-LENS, an educational assessment method using item text embeddings, achieving improved predictions, especially on unseen test items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving educational assessment by addressing the challenge of incorporating new items in predictive models, which often rely on historical data.

Method: Developed an extended partial variational auto-encoder, Text-LENS, to leverage item text embeddings, and evaluated it on two datasets (Eedi and LLM-Sim).

Result: Text-LENS performed comparably to its predecessor for seen items but significantly better for unseen items, learning and predicting student proficiency effectively.

Conclusion: Text-LENS enhances predictive performance and generalizability in educational assessments, particularly for unseen test items, making it a valuable tool for adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

*Md. Saif Hassan Onim,Travis S. Humble,Himanshu Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores emotion recognition using physiological signals to ensure privacy, comparing classical machine learning with quantum-enhanced models. Quantum methods outperform classical ones with a notable improvement in metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facial recognition techniques can raise privacy concerns in emotion recognition. There's a need for alternative methods using physiological signals to ensure privacy while maintaining accuracy. The approach also has potential applications in helping individuals with communication impairments.

Method: Researchers compared classical machine learning algorithms with hybrid quantum machine learning approaches, including a quantum kernel-based model, using wearable sensor data.

Result: Quantum-enhanced SVM achieved F1 scores over 80% across all emotion classes, and showed up to 36% recall improvement over classical methods, even with limited training datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating wearable sensors with quantum machine learning facilitates accurate, non-intrusive emotion recognition. This approach supports populations with communication challenges and lays groundwork for passive monitoring in clinical settings.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living

### [166] [Monitoring Risks in Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08721)
*Mona Schirmer,Metod Jazbec,Christian A. Naesseth,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a risk monitoring framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) models to track predictive performance and detect when models need offline retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of predictive models degrading due to shifted data at test time and to propose a method to monitor and detect points of failure in TTA methods.

Method: The paper extends existing sequential testing tools using confidence sequences to work in a scenario where the model adapts during test time with no labeled test data available.

Result: The proposed framework effectively allows rigorous statistical risk monitoring for TTA and demonstrates utility across various datasets, shift types, and TTA methods.

Conclusion: Augmenting TTA with a robust risk monitoring framework offers a practical solution for identifying the need for offline retraining, extending model reliability in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

*Junda Wu,Yuxin Xiong,Xintong Li,Zhengmian Hu,Tong Yu,Rui Wang,Xiang Chen,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CTRLS, a framework that uses Markov decision processes and distributional reinforcement learning to improve chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional chain-of-thought reasoning methods rely on heuristic sampling and lack structured modeling of reasoning transitions, limiting their ability to systematically explore diverse reasoning paths.

Method: The authors design CTRLS, which formulates reasoning as a Markov decision process with latent state transitions. It uses distributional reinforcement learning, epsilon-greedy exploration, and entropy-based regularization to improve reasoning performance iteratively, without fine-tuning the underlying language model.

Result: CTRLS improves reasoning accuracy, diversity, and exploration efficiency in benchmark tasks compared to conventional methods, according to experimental results.

Conclusion: CTRLS enhances the systematic and robust exploration of reasoning processes in language models by modeling reasoning as latent state transitions and applying principled reinforcement learning techniques.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

*Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh,Soroush H. Zargarbashi,Jimin Cao,Aleksandar Bojchevski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an evolutionary-based attack method on graph neural networks (GNNs), showcasing its effectiveness in outperforming existing attacks and revealing untapped vulnerabilities in GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-based attacks on GNNs rely on continuous-space optimization, leading to sub-optimal solutions and poor adaptability to non-differentiable objectives. This paper seeks to overcome these limitations by directly addressing the discrete optimization problem for perturbing graph structures.

Method: The authors introduce an improved evolutionary-based algorithm, termed Evolutionary Attack (EvA), which directly works in the discrete space. Unlike gradient-based methods, EvA is model-agnostic, eliminating the need for differentiable proxies and enabling its application in black-box scenarios.

Result: EvA demonstrates superior performance, achieving an extra ~11% drop in accuracy on average compared to previous best attacks. It is also shown to exploit vulnerabilities in robustness certificates and shatter conformal sets, with linear memory complexity proportional to the attack budget.

Conclusion: EvA presents a robust and adaptable attack method, shedding light on the need for further research into GNN vulnerabilities and robust defenses. Its novel approach highlights the potential of evolutionary techniques in adversarial graph manipulation.

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

*Peter Crowley,Zachary Serlin,Tyler Paine,Makai Mann,Michael Benjamin,Calin Belta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLASH is a new method in inverse reinforcement learning designed for long-term and adversarial tasks using suboptimal demonstrations, validated on maritime robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current IRL approaches assume expert demonstrations, which are often unavailable. Additionally, existing methods are inadequate for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks.

Method: The study introduces SPLASH, a preference-based IRL framework focused on long-horizon adversarial tasks using suboptimal hierarchical demonstrations. It includes both simulation and sim-to-real tests.

Result: SPLASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reward learning for suboptimal demonstrations on maritime environments.

Conclusion: The research advances IRL capabilities, particularly for complex robotic tasks, and validates the practicality of SPLASH in real-world settings.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces InsightBuild, a framework combining causality analysis and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to explain energy anomalies in smart buildings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart buildings produce large data streams, but facility managers struggle to interpret anomalous energy behavior, prompting the need for human-readable explanations.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage method: causal inference (via Granger causality tests and structural discovery) followed by LLM-generated textual explanations based on fine-tuned models.

Result: Testing on Google and Berkeley datasets (2017-2022 and 2018-2020), InsightBuild provides accurate, expert-evaluated explanations for energy use anomalies.

Conclusion: Explicit causal analysis paired with LLMs creates actionable insights, aiding energy inefficiency diagnosis and resolution in smart buildings.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility scenarios is underexplored due to a lack of large, labeled datasets, hindering effective training of deep-learning models.

Method: The authors use a self-supervised learning approach by pre-training a model on multi-modal data from existing datasets, then fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior dataset.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves the performance of prosocial behavior prediction models, addressing the issue of data scarcity.

Conclusion: The method serves as an effective benchmark for prosocial behavior prediction and provides insights to enhance intelligent vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

TL;DR: The paper presents CoreSPECT, a clustering enhancement framework improving accuracy for simpler algorithms like K-Means and GMM using insights into the interaction of density and geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neglected interaction between density distribution and geometry in clustering, and to improve the performance of simpler clustering algorithms such as K-Means and GMM.

Method: CoreSPECT leverages core space projection and neighborhood graph-based multi-layer propagation to partition datasets effectively by focusing on strategic sub-regions.

Result: On 15 datasets from three domains, CoreSPECT improves ARI for K-Means by 40% and for GMM by 14%, surpassing manifold-based and recent density-based algorithms.

Conclusion: CoreSPECT significantly boosts simpler clustering algorithms' accuracy, providing theoretical guarantees, robustness to noise, and ablations showcasing its design utility.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum-UnIMP, a framework combining quantum circuits with LLMs, achieving significant accuracy improvements in mixed-type data imputation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models struggle with missing data, particularly in mixed-type datasets (numerical, categorical, textual). While LLMs like UnIMP show promise, they falter in capturing complex, non-linear correlations using classical embeddings.

Method: The proposed Quantum-UnIMP replaces classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps derived from an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit, leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement.

Result: Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by up to 15.2% (numerical RMSE) and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% (categorical F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Quantum-UnIMP demonstrates the ability of quantum-enhanced features to better represent data complexities and improve imputation accuracy, even with current quantum hardware limitations.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data

*Hiroshi Yoshihara,Taiki Yamaguchi,Yuichi Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a combined training approach using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models while maximizing both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The method involves an extended SFT phase for high accuracy followed by a GRPO (a type of RL) phase to optimize token efficiency. The authors advocate for an extended SFT duration (up to 10 epochs) for performance improvements.

Result: The proposed recipe exhibited top-tier performance on mathematical benchmarks, including a high rank in the AI Mathematical Olympiad among 2,200 participants.

Conclusion: The introduced framework significantly advances mathematical reasoning in LLMs while ensuring reproducibility and practical efficiency. The authors also commit to open-sourcing their framework for further research.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will
open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and
training configurations at

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an efficient and scalable content moderation framework using small-scale language models to reduce computational requirements while maintaining high performance.

Method: The framework generates synthetic data via human-curated seed data, query augmentation, and paraphrasing. Adversarial reinforcement-learning-based training fine-tunes safety classifiers and improves performance.

Result: Small-scale language models outperformed larger counterparts in content moderation tasks while being more computationally efficient and resilient against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables small models to act as effective safety guardrails, reducing computational costs and enhancing robustness for AI content moderation systems.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity

Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN) for accurate workload prediction in dynamic cloud services, outperforming traditional models in prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural and deep learning models struggle with diverse, high-dimensional workloads, particularly under abrupt resource demand changes, due to limited optimization in training.

Method: The proposed CA-QNN utilizes quantum computing for converting workload data into qubits, processed through qubit neurons, coupled with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions and an architecture optimization algorithm.

Result: CA-QNN significantly enhances prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27% compared to current deep learning and QNN methods, as tested across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating quantum computing with comprehensive architectural optimization successfully addresses inefficiencies in workload prediction, offering a promising advancement for cloud services.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided single-cell embedded topic model, which enhances clustering and interpretability in scRNA-seq data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-cell embedded topic models suffer from qualitative-only interpretability evaluations, the issue of interpretation collapse, and lack of utilizing external biological knowledge.

Method: The proposed scE2TM model incorporates external biological knowledge for better cell embedding and clustering. Additionally, it introduces a new interpretability benchmark with 10 metrics for quantitative evaluation.

Result: scE2TM significantly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art methods across 20 scRNA-seq datasets in clustering performance. Its interpretability is also highly rated based on diversity and alignment with biological signals.

Conclusion: scE2TM enhances both analytical performance and interpretability in single-cell RNA sequencing, providing deeper insights into biological mechanisms and solving interpretation issues in existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of manually converting textual process documents into formal BPMN models is time-intensive, costly, and hampered by existing methods' inability to handle complex writing styles and parallel structures effectively.

Method: The authors propose an automated pipeline employing machine learning and large language models. They enhance a key dataset (PET) by adding 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways, improving model training for identifying parallel constructs.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates good reconstruction accuracy, effectively capturing parallel structures, thus addressing a major limitation in existing systems.

Conclusion: This approach provides a promising step towards automating BPMN model creation, offering time and cost efficiency while improving the accuracy of process representation.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of lane changes by vehicles can enhance safety and efficiency in traffic, yet previous works lacked comparisons between architectural models and analysis of input data for this task.

Method: The authors implemented and tested LSTM, CNN, and Transformer networks on the highD dataset to predict driver lane change intentions, analyzing how data preparation and different input configurations impacted performance.

Result: Transformers outperformed LSTM and CNN models in terms of accuracy (82.79% to 96.73%), and they exhibited better resistance to overfitting.

Conclusion: Transformers are a superior choice for predicting lane change intentions in automated systems, offering strong performance metrics and reduced sensitivity to overfitting.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Motivation: The paper explores the computational bottlenecks of classical machine learning and investigates how quantum computing principles can provide theoretical and practical solutions.

Method: The paper reviews quantum data encoding, optimization methods, and categorizes QML approaches by data and architecture. It examines notable applications while critically analyzing theoretical and practical limitations.

Result: Quantum tools like Quantum Principal Component Analysis and quantum-enhanced sensing show promising speed-ups for specialized tasks but face scalability and hardware challenges.

Conclusion: Quantum Machine Learning holds significant potential in specific high-value domains but requires overcoming issues like error correction, scalability, and benchmarks to achieve broader practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach to address biased significance testing in cluster analysis, presenting a two-cluster test leveraging boundary points to reduce inflated Type-I error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from the bias affecting conventional two-sample tests when comparing subsets generated by clustering methods, leading to disproportionately small p-values and inflated Type-I error rates.

Method: The proposed method derives analytical p-values by focusing on boundary points between subsets, offering a distinct significance testing framework for clustering applications.

Result: The method significantly reduces Type-I error rates when compared to classic approaches, as demonstrated in experiments with synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The two-cluster test is effective in overcoming cluster-based bias issues and proves its utility in tree-based interpretable clustering and hierarchical clustering applications.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Conclusion: By addressing distribution shift and incorrect value estimates, OPT significantly enhances the performance of offline-to-online RL agents, demonstrating its effectiveness for diverse environments.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored

SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach for discrete diffusion models to improve text generation quality using particle Gibbs sampling, achieving better accuracy under reward-guided settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored issue of inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models, particularly under reward-guided settings for text generation.

Method: The method involves particle Gibbs sampling, which iteratively refines diffusion trajectories using conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its mechanism.

Result: The proposed method outperforms previous inference-time strategies, showing significant accuracy improvements on reward-guided text generation tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement using the particle Gibbs sampling approach enhances inference-time scaling and quality of text generation under fixed compute budgets.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address variability and reliability issues in nanoelectronic devices caused by random telegraph noise, and the limitations of existing analysis techniques relying on manual interventions or restrictive assumptions.

Method: RTNinja uses machine learning and consists of two components: LevelsExtractor for denoising and discretizing signals, and SourcesMapper for inferring source configurations via probabilistic clustering and optimization.

Result: RTNinja showed high-accuracy in reconstructing signals and extracting source characteristics across 7000 simulated datasets, handling wide noise ratios and source complexities.

Conclusion: RTNinja is a robust and scalable tool that enables comprehensive RTN analysis, predictive modeling, and enhanced reliability assessments for next-gen nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KGRAG-Ex, a RAG system grounded in domain-specific knowledge graphs to improve factual grounding and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with explainability, particularly using unstructured text for retrieval. Knowledge graphs can provide structured semantics for better interpretability.

Method: KGRAG-Ex uses a knowledge graph built with prompt-based information extraction to identify relevant entities and paths, transformed into pseudo-paragraphs guiding retrieval. Explanation methods analyze the influence of graph components.

Result: Experiments show how perturbation methods, graph structure positions, semantic node types, and graph metrics influence component importance in explanations.

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex enhances interpretability and reasoning transparency in retrieval-augmented generation systems by leveraging structured semantic information from knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Method: The paper introduces RSS-MLP, which incorporates Rank Set Sampling to impose an ordered structure in training data and reduce loss variance. This is compared to bagging methods utilizing Simple Random Sampling (SRS).

Result: RSS-MLP demonstrates theoretically and experimentally reduced empirical loss variance. Benchmark experiments across twelve datasets validate its effectiveness against standard methods.

Conclusion: RSS-MLP is effective and logical, achieving better variance reduction and improving the performance of MLPs as compared to traditional SRS-based bagging approaches.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

*Joel Schlotthauer,Christian Kroos,Chris Hinze,Viktor Hangya,Luzian Hahn,Fabian Küch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares three optimizers (AdamW, Lion, and Sophia) for LLM pre-training, finding Sophia excels at loss reduction, Lion is fastest, and AdamW achieves the best downstream results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the performance of prominent optimizers for large language model pre-training given the impact of optimization algorithms on model quality and training efficiency.

Method: Two different base architectures, proxy models, Maximal Update Parametrization, and tuned hyperparameters were used to evaluate the effectiveness of optimizers across single and multiple epochs.

Result: Sophia showed lowest training/validation loss, Lion had fastest training (GPU hours), and AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: While performance varied by criteria, all optimizers performed comparably, with specific strengths like speed, loss minimization, or downstream task performance.

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

### [191] [Evaluating SAE interpretability without explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08473)
*Gonçalo Paulo,Nora Belrose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to evaluate sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders' interpretability without requiring natural language explanations, providing more direct and standardized assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of consensus on how to effectively measure the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and transcoders, with current methods being entangled with explanation generation processes.

Method: The authors adapt existing evaluation methods to directly assess sparse coders' interpretability and compare the resulting metrics with human evaluations.

Result: The new evaluation method provides more consistent and standardized interpretability metrics, aligning well with human assessment.

Conclusion: The authors suggest improvements for the evaluation of interpretability techniques, advocating for methods that bypass the need for natural language explanations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynBridge is a bidirectional generative model leveraging graph-to-graph transformers to predict chemical reactions by modeling transformations in electronic states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better model the discrete and abrupt nature of chemical reaction transitions for enhanced reaction prediction.

Method: Proposed SynBridge, a graph-based transformer and discrete flow model, to predict bidirectional chemical transformations.

Result: Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets (USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio) for forward and retrosynthesis tasks.

Conclusion: Structured diffusion over discrete spaces enhances reaction prediction accuracy, validated by experiments and analyses.

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys multiple deployment frameworks (llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, mllm) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile devices, identifying CPU overuse and underutilization of GPU/NPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational and energy challenges in deploying VLMs on mobile devices for real-time applications.

Method: Benchmarking llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm with representative VLMs (LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, Imp-v1.5 3B) on a OnePlus 13R, measuring hardware utilization, inference time, and power.

Result: CPU resources were overused during token generation, while GPUs and NPUs were underutilized or unstable. GPU saturation in image feature extraction reduced device responsiveness.

Conclusion: The paper provides benchmarks and identifies critical hardware utilization bottlenecks, highlighting the need to optimize current VLM deployment frameworks for balanced hardware usage.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

### [194] [SFedKD: Sequential Federated Learning with Discrepancy-Aware Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08508)
*Haotian Xu,Jinrui Zhou,Xichong Zhang,Mingjun Xiao,He Sun,Yin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SFedKD, a sequential federated learning (SFL) framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation to address catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) experiences catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous environments, causing models to lose knowledge from previous clients.

Method: The authors propose SFedKD, which employs discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, fine-grained weighting strategies for class knowledge, and a complementary-based teacher selection mechanism to enhance training and prevent knowledge dilution.

Result: SFedKD alleviates catastrophic forgetting, achieves superior training efficacy, and outperforms existing federated learning approaches.

Conclusion: SFedKD is an effective solution to catastrophic forgetting in Sequential Federated Learning and offers substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

*Yuting Tang,Yivan Zhang,Johannes Ackermann,Yu-Jie Zhang,Soichiro Nishimori,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores flexible behavior alignment in reinforcement learning without modifying the reward function, using algebraic perspectives to generalize reward aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions in reinforcement learning can be complex, especially for intricate desired objectives, necessitating new methodologies.

Method: The paper proposes using algebraic perspectives on Markov decision processes (MDPs), enabling the generalization of standard discounted sum rewards to alternative recursive aggregations like discounted max and Sharpe ratio.

Result: Experiments show the approach optimizes various objectives effectively, showcasing its adaptability and applicability.

Conclusion: The approach proves to be versatile, eliminating reward function modifications while optimizing diverse objectives, making it promising for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

### [196] [CircFormerMoE: An End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Circular RNA Splice Site Detection and Pairing in Plant Genomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08542)
*Tianyou Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CircFormerMoE, a deep learning framework for predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA, addressing limitations of prior alignment-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circRNA identification methods face challenges such as reliance on RNA experimental data, high computational cost, inefficiency for large-scale predictions, and lack of deep learning solutions designed for plants.

Method: CircFormerMoE leverages transformers and mixture-of-experts architecture, focusing on two subtasks: splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing (SSP), validated on genomic data of 10 plant species.

Result: The model demonstrated effective prediction of circRNAs, discovered unannotated circRNAs, and provided high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE offers a robust tool for circRNA discovery in plants, advancing research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA annotation.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

*Xinyi Ning,Zilin Bian,Kaan Ozbay,Semiha Ergan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for vehicle trajectory prediction that incorporates surrounding risks to improve safety and efficiency in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction methods often overlook uncertain or aggressive behaviors of nearby vehicles, increasing safety risks in autonomous driving.

Method: A spatial-temporal risk-attentive prediction framework using an encoder-decoder structure integrates risk potential fields into spatial-temporal feature representations, supplemented by a risk-scaled loss function.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach achieves a 4.8% and 31.2% reduction in average trajectory prediction errors on NGSIM and HighD datasets respectively, particularly in high-risk scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables interpretable, risk-aware trajectory predictions that enhance decision-making robustness in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: AbbIE introduces a recursive method to improve Transformer performance, offering better perplexity, flexible computation at test time, and enhanced zero-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve language model performance by achieving better perplexity and dynamic computational adaptability through an innovative transformer architecture.

Method: Developed AbbIE, a recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer that operates in latent space without specialized datasets or training and generalizes upward during iterations.

Result: AbbIE showed up to 12% improvement in zero-shot in-context learning tasks and 5% enhancement in language perplexity on models up to 350M parameters.

Conclusion: AbbIE offers a promising alternative for scaling LLM performance, broadening possibilities in dynamic resource allocation and task generalization.

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address performance degradation in machine learning models for malware detection due to concept drift, while reducing reliance on costly ground truth annotations.

Method: The paper introduces ADAPT, a novel semi-supervised, pseudo-labeling algorithm that is model-agnostic and adaptable to various machine learning models, such as neural networks and tree-based algorithms.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted across five diverse malware detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPT consistently outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADAPT facilitates more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in malware detection, making it a promising approach for reducing annotation burdens and maintaining model performance over time.

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a remote sensing system that uses satellite imagery to monitor sustainable irrigation practices in Punjab, India, achieving accurate classification and scalable mapping to inform policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical water management challenges in rice production, where traditional irrigation consumes a significant fraction of global freshwater, and to promote sustainability amidst water scarcity.

Method: The study developed a remote sensing framework using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and ground-truth data from trained farmers in Punjab. It classifies irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and monitors these practices across millions of plots.

Result: The method achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing DSR from traditional methods without prior planting date knowledge and demonstrated a high correlation with government records, showcasing scalability and accuracy.

Conclusion: The remote sensing framework provides an effective tool for monitoring sustainable practices, enabling policymakers to better allocate resources, measure impacts, and target interventions in water-scarce regions.

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LoGIC, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for unsupervised image captioning, achieving compelling results without the need for additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve unsupervised image captioning performance and address challenges in using existing labeled datasets that have largely been exhausted by current large Vision Language Models.

Method: Developed LoGIC, a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game with a 'speaker' and 'listener' to collaboratively learn a communication strategy, leveraging GRPO and pre-trained VLMs and LLMs, as well as lightweight models trained from scratch.

Result: LoGIC achieves a 46 BLEU score after fine-tuning pre-trained VLMs and 31 BLEU score with lightweight models trained unsupervised, outperforming baseline methods by 2 and 10 BLEU points respectively.

Conclusion: LoGIC demonstrates potential for enhancing unsupervised image captioning, offering efficiency and competitive performance without relying on additional labeled data.

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses collaborative fairness in federated learning, focusing on handling imbalanced covariate shifts. It proposes FedAKD, an updated approach that integrates asynchronous knowledge distillation strategies to resolve sample variability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve collaborative fairness and predictive accuracy in federated learning, especially under challenging data heterogeneity like imbalanced covariate shifts.

Method: FedAKD utilizes asynchronous knowledge distillation strategies. It makes client updates by focusing on correctly predicted high-confidence samples and applies traditional distillation for misclassified ones. It finalizes server updates through model aggregation, ensuring convergence.

Result: Results show FedAKD enhances collaborative fairness, predictive accuracy, and client participation under heterogeneous datasets including FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and an EHR dataset.

Conclusion: FedAKD effectively addresses imbalanced covariate shifts in federated learning, proving its theoretical convergence while ensuring better fairness and accuracy across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WERSA, a novel efficient attention mechanism for processing long sequences, overcoming the quadratic complexity of traditional transformer models, achieving both high accuracy and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of transformer models with quadratic attention complexity when dealing with long sequences, making such models practical for low-resource hardware.

Method: Proposes Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), which combines random spectral features, multi-resolution Haar wavelets, and learnable parameters for efficient and selective attention computation with linear O(n) complexity.

Result: WERSA outperformed other attention mechanisms such as Flash-Attention-2 and Waveformer across multiple benchmarks, achieving better accuracy and significant reductions in training time and FLOPS—even on extremely long sequences where other methods fail.

Conclusion: WERSA is a sustainable, scalable, and computationally efficient mechanism for long-sequence processing, providing practical solutions for low-resource scenarios and improving the feasibility of extensive long-context models.

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s

### [204] [Forget Me Not: Fighting Local Overfitting with Knowledge Fusion and Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08686)
*Uri Stern,Eli Corn,Daphna Weinshall*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses localized overfitting in neural networks and proposes a method that aggregates model checkpoints into ensembles and distills them back into a single model for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in deep neural networks often defies theoretical expectations. This study seeks to understand cases of local overfitting, a novel phenomenon where overfitting occurs only in specific sub-regions of the data space.

Method: The authors measure the forgetting behavior of deep models using a novel score and propose a two-step approach: (1) aggregate checkpoints into an ensemble, and (2) distill this ensemble into a single compact model to enhance performance.

Result: The proposed method overcomes local overfitting, achieves better performance than original models, and excels in scenarios with label noise. It reduces training and inference complexity.

Conclusion: Knowledge Fusion combined with Knowledge Distillation reduces local overfitting and computational demands, providing a scalable solution to a critical problem in neural network training.

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Mahalanobis Distance-based Optimization (MAD-OPT) framework to use AI in thermal power plants effectively by integrating domain knowledge into data analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of AI in thermal power plants is limited due to the 'black-box' nature of AI algorithms and the insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge into conventional data-centric analytics.

Method: The authors propose a MAD-OPT framework that incorporates Mahalanobis distance-based constraints to integrate domain knowledge into AI-powered analytics. They applied the framework to optimize thermal efficiency and turbine heat rate in a 395 MW gas turbine system and evaluated its robustness via Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The MAD-OPT framework successfully predicted domain-informed optimal process conditions under varying ambient conditions, showed robustness through Monte Carlo simulations, and provided comparable results to actual data when estimating operational conditions beyond the system's design limit.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge via the MAD-OPT framework enhances operational excellence and provides a safe pathway for adopting AI in thermal power systems by addressing the limitations of conventional data-driven methods.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

*Jan Felix Kleuker,Aske Plaat,Thomas Moerland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a large-scale empirical analysis of Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) in reinforcement learning, examining its two key regularization components and the importance of their combination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited empirical investigations regarding Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) and to provide insights into the interaction of its regularization techniques in reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors conducted a large-scale empirical analysis using over 500k training seeds on small RL environments, focusing on the effects and interplay of PMD's distance term and MDP regularizer.

Result: Findings reveal that while the two regularizers can partially replace each other, their precise combination is crucial for achieving robust reinforcement learning performance.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for research on more robust RL algorithms, particularly concerning their sensitivity to hyperparameters.

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

*Idan Mashiach,Oren Glickman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in deep learning using a novel method that focuses on parameter tracking during the final training plateau.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve deep neural networks' ability to learn new tasks without degrading performance on previously learned ones.

Method: The approach involves tracking parameter activity during the final stages of training, focusing on movement and variability during the plateau phase.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining strong new task learning.

Conclusion: Tracking parameter activity during the final training plateau offers a viable strategy to address catastrophic forgetting in deep learning models.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

*Azimov Sherkhon,Susana Lopez-Moreno,Eric Dolores-Cuenca,Sieun Lee,Sangil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive NVAR model that integrates learnable MLP features to improve scalability and predictive accuracy, especially in noisy and high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like standard NVAR and RC struggle with adaptability to noisy or real-world data due to their reliance on fixed nonlinearities, and they are computationally inefficient in high-dimensional contexts.

Method: The authors introduce an adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with a trainable MLP. The entire system, including the MLP and linear readout, is optimized using gradient-based training.

Result: The adaptive NVAR model demonstrated better predictive accuracy than standard NVAR, performing robustly under noisy conditions and with lower observation frequencies.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances adaptability and scalability, making it suitable for real-world chaotic system forecasting under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO), a hybrid quantum-classical extension of QFNO for scientific machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in extending QFNOs to higher dimensions, improve distribution across devices, and leverage hybrid quantum-classical computation for scientific problems.

Method: Partitioned computation of Fourier operators using classical and quantum resources, message-passing for data distribution, unary data encoding into quantum states, and optimization using a variational scheme.

Result: PHQFNO matches classical FNO accuracy, outperforms on specific equations like incompressible Navier-Stokes, and exhibits enhanced stability under noisy input.

Conclusion: PHQFNO is a viable method that effectively leverages hybrid quantum-classical architectures for scientific learning tasks, with promising accuracy and stability benefits over purely classical methods.

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

*Chuanqi Chen,Zhongrui Wang,Nan Chen,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) combines Koopman embedding with Gaussian systems to enable efficient state forecasting and data assimilation (DA) for complex dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in state forecasting and DA for partially observed high-dimensional systems governed by nonlinear PDEs.

Method: A discrete-time CGKN is developed based on conditional linear dynamics of latent states coupled with observed states. Analytical formulae are used for efficient Gaussian posterior evaluation and DA integration.

Result: Experiments on nonlinear PDE systems like Burgers' equation and Navier-Stokes demonstrate comparable predictive performance to state-of-the-art SciML methods and efficient DA processing.

Conclusion: CGKN unifies scientific machine learning (SciML) with data assimilation and showcases its potential in broader applications such as optimization and control.

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

*Tiffany Yu,Rye Stahle-Smith,Darssan Eswaramoorthi,Rasha Karakchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoSlim, a machine learning-based framework that simplifies Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) graphs for symbolic accelerators, leading to significant resource savings on FPGA-based overlays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic accelerators often struggle with scalability due to high memory consumption and complex routing, making it difficult to process large datasets efficiently.

Method: AutoSlim uses a Random Forest classification method to identify and prune low-impact NFA graph transitions based on edge scores and structural features, while maintaining the graph's semantic correctness.

Result: AutoSlim reduces FPGA LUT usage by up to 40% and transitions by more than 30%, while enabling scalability to much larger graphs compared to prior benchmarks. It also addresses challenges related to hardware interconnection costs.

Conclusion: AutoSlim effectively balances resource efficiency and performance in symbolic accelerators, establishing a practical approach for scalable symbolic data processing.

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses Q-value extrapolation errors in offline reinforcement learning by proposing a new algorithm, PARS, which guides Q-value behavior beyond the data range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Q-value extrapolation errors hinder reinforcement learning performance when using offline data, necessitating solutions for better generalization.

Method: The authors introduce PARS, which combines reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and penalizes infeasible actions (PA) to guide Q-values during training.

Result: The PARS algorithm shows superior performance in offline reinforcement learning and online fine-tuning, achieving success in tasks like the AntMaze Ultra challenge on the D4RL benchmark.

Conclusion: PARS effectively addresses Q-value extrapolation issues, resulting in improved reliability and performance for reinforcement learning across challenging tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BlockFFN, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to improve computational efficiency and acceleration compatibility for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face computational inefficiencies, particularly under low-resource conditions, when using vanilla MoE architectures due to inflexible routing and low chunk-level sparsity.

Method: BlockFFN architecture integrates differentiable routing with ReLU and RMSNorm, introduces chunk-level sparsity-aware training objectives, and implements acceleration kernels combining activation sparsity with speculative decoding.

Result: BlockFFN outperforms other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% token-level sparsity and 70% 8-token chunk-level sparsity. Its kernels achieve up to 3.67x speedup on end-side devices compared to dense models.

Conclusion: BlockFFN resolves prior inefficiencies in sparse models, enhancing both model performance and real-world deployment speed, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

*Chuyan Chen,Yutong He,Pengrui Li,Weichen Jia,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GreedyLore, a low-rank gradient compression method for distributed learning that combines greedy strategies with rigorous convergence guarantees, achieving linear speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for large-scale signal processing and machine learning is hindered by communication overhead. Although low-rank gradient compression reduces communication by approximating gradients with low-rank matrices, existing methods either suffer from high variance or lack convergence guarantees.

Method: The authors introduce GreedyLore, a method combining error feedback and semi-lazy subspace updates to ensure a contractive compression operator. This is the first approach to use a greedy strategy alongside rigorous convergence guarantees for low-rank gradient compression.

Result: GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under optimizers like MSGD and Adam. Experiments confirm the method's theoretical performance.

Conclusion: GreedyLore successfully bridges the gap between high performance in empirical settings and theoretical convergence guarantees for low-rank gradient compression methods, making it a substantial contribution to distributed optimization.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

*James McCarthy,Radu Marinescu,Elizabeth Daly,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the ORAC framework for risk-averse reinforcement learning, which balances reward and safety during exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to tackle the challenge of Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) where conservative exploration often leads to suboptimal policy performance.

Method: The ORAC framework combines maximizing an upper confidence bound for rewards and minimizing a lower confidence bound for costs. It dynamically adjusts cost weighting to encourage exploration while adhering to safety constraints.

Result: Experimental results show that ORAC avoids suboptimal policies and improves the reward-cost trade-off in tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and CityLearn.

Conclusion: ORAC enables effective exploration in RaCRL while satisfying safety constraints, demonstrating significant improvements in policy outcomes and overall safety compliance.

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

TL;DR: Generative reward models using LLMs for evaluation are vulnerable to superficial manipulations, jeopardizing their reliability in reinforcement learning tasks, but a simple data augmentation strategy improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of rigid rule-based metrics in evaluating complex reasoning tasks and improve the reliability of LLMs as judges in reinforcement learning paradigms.

Method: The study identified vulnerabilities in LLM-based generative reward models through experiments, then proposed and applied a data augmentation strategy to train a more robust reward model.

Result: The proposed data augmentation strategy significantly improved the robustness of generative reward models against manipulative inputs, validated across LLMs, datasets, and formats.

Conclusion: There is an urgent necessity for more robust LLM-based evaluation methods, and the proposed solution provides a step forward in mitigating reliability issues. The study also released resources for broader application.

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We

### [217] [The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802)
*Denis Sutter,Julian Minder,Thomas Hofmann,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the application of causal abstraction in neural networks by examining it with non-linear alignment maps, showing that without constraints, causal abstraction becomes uninformative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of current methods in understanding how neural networks make decisions through causal abstraction, especially the widely used linear alignment maps.

Method: The authors analyze causal abstraction using arbitrarily powerful (non-linear) alignment maps, providing both theoretical proofs and empirical experiments with randomly initialized language models.

Result: Theoretically, the authors show that any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm when alignment maps lack constraints. Experimentally, they map models incapable of solving tasks to algorithms with perfect accuracy on tasks like indirect object identification.

Conclusion: The study argues that unconstrained causal abstraction is trivial and insufficient for interpretability, emphasizing the need for future work to explore how models encode information and the role of constraints in alignment maps.

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeurOptimiser, a neuromorphic-based framework for optimization using biologically-inspired spiking dynamics, achieving energy-efficient and decentralized performance on Intel's Lava platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The energy-intensive nature of artificial intelligence necessitates exploration of computational models that are both efficient and scalable, leading to interest in Neuromorphic Computing for minimal power solutions.

Method: NeurOptimiser employs Neuromorphic Heuristic Units combining spiking neuron dynamics with spike-triggered heuristics for decentralized optimization, tested on the Loihi 2 chip.

Result: The framework showed structured population dynamics, consistent convergence, and feasibility at milliwatt-level power consumption, highlighting its potential for low-energy computation.

Conclusion: NeurOptimiser validates the viability of spike-native metaheuristics for real-time, decentralized, and energy-efficient optimization, with opportunities for further improvements and extensions.

Abstract: The increasing energy footprint of artificial intelligence systems urges
alternative computational models that are both efficient and scalable.
Neuromorphic Computing (NC) addresses this challenge by empowering event-driven
algorithms that operate with minimal power requirements through biologically
inspired spiking dynamics. We present the NeurOptimiser, a fully spike-based
optimisation framework that materialises the neuromorphic-based metaheuristic
paradigm through a decentralised NC system. The proposed approach comprises a
population of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units (NHUs), each combining spiking
neuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve
candidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimiser's coordination arises
through native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local
information sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration.
We implement this framework on Intel's Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2
chip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We
deploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly
considering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking
neural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for
spike-triggered heuristics. Although these configurations are implemented as a
proof of concept, we document and outline further extensions and improvements
to the framework implementation. Results show that the proposed approach
exhibits structured population dynamics, consistent convergence, and
milliwatt-level power feasibility. They also position spike-native MHs as a
viable path toward real-time, low-energy, and decentralised optimisation.

### [219] [Enhancing Parameter Control Policies with State Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08368)
*Gianluca Covini,Denis Antipov,Carola Doerr*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces four benchmarks that derive optimal or near-optimal control policies for dynamic parameter selection in the RLS$_k$ algorithm applied to the LeadingOnes function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore benchmark cases where optimal control policies for parameter adjustment in algorithms can be thoroughly analyzed, as such cases are limited yet critical for advancements in automated parameter control.

Method: The authors propose benchmarks where the RLS$_k$ algorithm dynamically adjusts mutation strength using additional information beyond just the quality of the current-best solution, such as the OneMax value.

Result: Using richer state information about the algorithm's condition leads to better parameter decisions, yielding a significant speed-up in expected runtime, especially in marginal states.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks serve as a robust platform for testing parameter control methods in diverse state spaces, showcasing significant runtime improvements from optimal parameter adjustments.

Abstract: Parameter control and dynamic algorithm configuration study how to
dynamically choose suitable configurations of a parametrized algorithm during
the optimization process. Despite being an intensively researched topic in
evolutionary computation, optimal control policies are known only for very few
cases, limiting the development of automated approaches to achieve them.
  With this work we propose four new benchmarks for which we derive optimal or
close-to-optimal control policies. More precisely, we consider the optimization
of the \LeadingOnes function via RLS$_{k}$, a local search algorithm allowing
for a dynamic choice of the mutation strength $k$. The benchmarks differ in
which information the algorithm can exploit to set its parameters and to select
offspring. In existing running time results, the exploitable information is
typically limited to the quality of the current-best solution. In this work, we
consider how additional information about the current state of the algorithm
can help to make better choices of parameters, and how these choices affect the
performance. Namely, we allow the algorithm to use information about the
current \OneMax value, and we find that it allows much better parameter
choices, especially in marginal states. Although those states are rarely
visited by the algorithm, such policies yield a notable speed-up in terms of
expected runtime. This makes the proposed benchmarks a challenging, but
promising testing ground for analysis of parameter control methods in rich
state spaces and of their ability to find optimal policies by catching the
performance improvements yielded by correct parameter choices.

### [220] [Dependent Multiplicities in Dependent Linear Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08759)
*Maximilian Doré*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dependent linear type theory with variable-dependent multiplicities for precise resource annotations, showcased through an implementation in Agda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing type systems struggle to provide precise resource annotations, particularly for higher-order functions, necessitating a refined system.

Method: The approach embeds linear logic into dependent type theory, combining them via the Dialectica translation, and uses standard natural number types for quantitative typing.

Result: The system was characterized semantically as a blend of standard dependent type theory and linear logic and implemented successfully in Agda.

Conclusion: The proposed system adds advanced resource annotation capabilities to dependently typed languages, addressing limitations in existing systems.

Abstract: We present a novel dependent linear type theory in which the multiplicity of
some variable - i.e., the number of times the variable can be used in a program
- can depend on other variables. This allows us to give precise resource
annotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in
any other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline
is obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying
how the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a
standard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with
dependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a
combination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our
system can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate
with an implementation in Agda.

### [221] [Filter Equivariant Functions: A symmetric account of length-general extrapolation on lists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08796)
*Owen Lewis,Neil Ghani,Andrew Dudzik,Christos Perivolaropoulos,Razvan Pascanu,Petar Veličković*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper explores filter-equivariant functions, a new class that ensures predictable behavior when list elements are removed through a standard filter operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define a 'good' extrapolant function that adheres to certain rules for predictable behavior, specifically when elements are removed from a list.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of filter-equivariant functions, relate it to map-equivariant functions, and provide a geometric perspective through simplicial structures. They also propose an amalgamation algorithm for constructing filter-equivariant functions.

Result: The paper establishes foundational theorems for filter-equivariant functions, highlights their relationship with map-equivariant functions, and introduces an amalgamation algorithm for perfect extrapolation.

Conclusion: Filter-equivariant functions provide a robust framework for rule-following behavior in list functions, especially under element removal, with theoretical and geometrical grounding and practical algorithmic solutions.

Abstract: What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples
look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function
matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct
extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of
rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following
in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when
certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to
express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our
paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant
functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some
basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map
equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter
equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial
structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which
constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it
behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

### [222] [Noise-Enabled Goal Attainment in Crowded Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08100)
*Lucy Liu,Justin Werfel,Federico Toschi,L. Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how noisy motion in dense environments can alleviate traffic jams, thus optimizing agent navigation and goal attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and control traffic flows in crowded spaces, which is pivotal for coordinating robot swarms and improving infrastructure design.

Method: The authors use simulations, theoretical modeling, and robotic experiments to analyze the impact of noise levels on traffic jams and goal attainment across agents.

Result: They found that above a critical noise threshold, jams dissipate, and they approximated optimal noise and density conditions to maximize goal rates. Results were validated via robotic experiments.

Conclusion: A reactive, computationally efficient navigation method is effective in moderately dense environments, providing practical insights for infrastructure and robotic swarm design.

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

*Lamiaa H. Zain,Hossam H. Ammar,Raafat E. Shalaby*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This research uses custom CNNs and sensor fusion with color and depth inputs for obstacle avoidance navigation in mobile robots, collecting novel datasets to train and evaluate performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve navigation and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots in various environments by leveraging color and depth imagery with CNNs.

Method: Two custom CNNs were trained using visual datasets collected through a mobile robot equipped with depth cameras, and synchronized with steering commands over ROS via a Wi-Fi link.

Result: Evaluation metrics compared the performance of the two CNNs, helping identify the more suitable network for mobile robot obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Custom CNNs incorporating sensor fusion can handle diverse environments for obstacle avoidance in robot navigation effectively.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in both known and
unknown environments. This research designs, trains, and tests two custom
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using color and depth images from a depth
camera as inputs. Both networks adopt sensor fusion to produce an output: the
mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command.
A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling
synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands.
Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and
Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and
clarified which one to use for the application.

### [224] [Making VLMs More Robot-Friendly: Self-Critical Distillation of Low-Level Procedural Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08224)
*Chan Young Park,Jillian Fisher,Marius Memmel,Dipika Khullar,Andy Yun,Abhishek Gupta,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents SelfReVision, a scalable framework that enables small vision-language models (VLMs) to generate high-quality, executable plans through self-critiquing and revising, outperforming much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic procedural planning with LLMs lacks low-level, grounded details for execution, and current VLMs solutions are either resource-heavy or lack scalability. This paper aims to create a lightweight and effective framework.

Method: The authors introduce the SelfReVision framework, which uses a self-improvement loop inspired by chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms. It allows small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify their plans without external supervision or teacher models.

Result: SelfReVision significantly improves the quality of plans generated by smaller models, outperforming much larger 100X-sized models in downstream embodied tasks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that a self-improvement approach in small VLMs can yield highly efficient and accurate results for robotic procedural planning, making them viable alternatives to resource-heavy, large-scale models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL3R, a pre-training framework that uses a point cloud Masked Autoencoder and 2D foundation models to enhance robotic manipulation by addressing challenges in 3D spatial awareness and viewpoint generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current robotic perception modules, which struggle with capturing 3D spatial data and generalizing across diverse camera viewpoints, impeding their use in fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: The proposed method combines a point cloud Masked Autoencoder for 3D spatial learning and contrastive learning using pre-trained 2D semantic models. It also unifies coordinate systems and incorporates random fusion of multi-view point clouds for better generalization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority in visuomotor policy learning, both in simulations and in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: CL3R effectively combines 3D spatial and semantic understanding to overcome previous limitations, resulting in enhanced generalization and robust perception for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust adversarial training method using a learnable attack network to improve the robustness of humanoid robots in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots often struggle with robustness issues in reinforcement learning-based motion policies due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap.

Method: The researchers introduce an adversarial attack network to identify vulnerabilities in robot motion policies and train them dynamically for robustness improvement.

Result: Experiments on Unitree G1 robots show improved motion robustness, allowing navigation through challenging terrains and agile trajectory tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial training approach enhances the real-world motion robustness and agility of humanoid robots.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real
worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that
precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body
control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body
trajectory tracking.

*Junhui Wang,Yan Qiao,Chao Gao,Naiqi Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a targetless method to achieve accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) for intelligent mining vehicles, addressing existing limitations like overlapping sensor views, artificial targets, and trajectory estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration methods for multiple LiDAR sensors and GINS often rely on unrealistic assumptions such as the need for artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or precise trajectory estimation, which are impractical in real-world mining environments and ineffective due to the planar motion of mining vehicles.

Method: The authors developed a targetless method that uses an observation model based on the known installation height of the GINS unit and a joint optimization framework. This framework refines both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by integrating constraints derived from geometric correspondences and motion consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated the proposed method's accuracy, robustness, and adaptability to various heterogeneous LiDAR configurations, including mechanical and solid-state sensors.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, accurate, and robust solution for extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and GINS without requiring overlapping views or external targets, making it suitable for diverse sensor setups in intelligent mining vehicles.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

*Deteng Zhang,Junjie Zhang,Yan Sun,Tao Li,Hao Yin,Hongzhao Xie,Jie Yin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in SLAM robustness under challenging conditions by introducing a dataset (M3DGR), evaluating 40 SLAM systems, and proposing a modular multi-sensor fusion framework called Ground-Fusion++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in SLAM for structured environments, these methods fail in corner cases, and adaptive multi-sensor fusion strategies have not been fully explored due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and adaptive frameworks.

Method: The authors introduce the M3DGR dataset with systematic degradation scenarios, evaluate 40 SLAM systems on this dataset, and propose the Ground-Fusion++ framework utilizing GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry.

Result: The comprehensive evaluation revealed critical insights into the weaknesses of SLAM systems under challenging scenarios. Ground-Fusion++ showcased robust performance across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The study presents a new benchmark and highlights the potential of adaptive multi-sensor fusion with Ground-Fusion++, offering the community valuable tools for advancing SLAM research.

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes TD3-HD, a reinforcement learning-based control strategy improving satellite attitude resilience and adaptability under reaction wheel faults. It outperforms traditional PD controllers and common DRL algorithms in stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous satellites operating in uncertain environments need robust attitude control systems resilient to faults in reaction wheels to ensure mission success.

Method: The study combines TD3 algorithm with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) to create TD3-HD, which is then tested against other control strategies.

Result: The TD3-HD method demonstrated superior performance during experiments, achieving lower attitude error, better angular velocity regulation, and improved fault tolerance compared to PD controllers and standard DRL approaches.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that TD3-HD is a promising onboard AI solution for fault-tolerant satellite attitude control in autonomous satellite operations.

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of cumulative drift and misalignment in LiDAR-based 3D mapping, especially in GNSS-constrained urban environments.

Method: The framework integrates velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping, extended Kalman filtering to refine GNSS/IMU data, local map construction through NDT-based registration, pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, and global consistency enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors and fine segment registration.

Result: The proposed method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32m to 1.24m, achieving a 61.4% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: The method enhances 3D city mapping accuracy in challenging environments and provides a new benchmark dataset and an open-source codebase for future research.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

*Juraj Gavura,Michal Vavrecka,Igor Farkas,Connor Gade*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method for addressing discrepancies in robotic arm control between simulation and reality using haptic feedback calibration with a touchscreen, reducing end effector positioning errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address discrepancies between the simulated end effector (EE) position of robotic arms and their real-world counterparts in sim-to-real transfer, where real EE position data is often unavailable.

Method: The proposed method uses haptic feedback calibration with a touchscreen. The robot touches specific points on the screen for calibration, storing the interactions. Then, a transformation function is generated using linear transformation and neural networks to predict missing variables from partial inputs.

Result: The study found that a fully nonlinear neural network model significantly reduced positioning errors compared to other approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network-based method bridges the gap between simulation and reality for robotic arm manipulation tasks, enabling more accurate control of the end effector in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

*Aravind Elanjimattathil Vijayan,Andrei Cramariuc,Mattia Risiglione,Christian Gehring,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an RL-based framework for simultaneous locomotion and arm motions, addressing task conflicts using a multi-critic actor architecture and twist-based end-effector control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise in combining locomotion and arm motions because these tasks have conflicting objectives, such as stable walking vs. extended reachability.

Method: The authors use a new multi-critic actor architecture and a twist-based task formulation to separate locomotion and manipulation reward tuning, enabling velocity-aware whole-body control.

Result: Simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that the controller effectively performs both walking and end-effector tracking, with emergent collaborative behaviors.

Conclusion: This approach simplifies reward tuning, enables smooth task execution, and produces a system capable of dynamic whole-body control for complex robot tasks.

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

*Yuekun Wu,Yik Lung Pang,Andrea Cavallaro,Changjae Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces H2RH-SGS, a supervised learning method allowing robots to perform human-to-robot handovers using only RGB images, leveraging Gaussian Splatting for realistic simulation without real-world training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of visual domain gaps between simulation and real-world robot manipulation, and enabling cost-effective robot learning without physical trials.

Method: The method uses Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting to recreate realistic handover scenes, which are then used to train a robot policy directly from simulated image-action pairs.

Result: The method successfully trains a robot on simulated demonstrations with household objects and deploys it effectively in real robotic environments.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS is a promising approach for robot manipulation tasks, providing realistic visual reconstruction and bypassing the need for costly real-world training.

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the shift in software tools for fusion and fission energy engineering, highlighting the shift towards modern programming languages, open-source, and modular software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the current and emerging trends among computational scientists developing codes for fusion and fission energy.

Method: A survey conducted in 2024 of 103 computational scientists working in fusion and fission energy, analyzing their tools, problems, and developer experience.

Result: Survey revealed increasing preference for modern languages like Python and C++, a decline in FORTRAN usage, rise of modular and multiphysics codes, and increasing budgets for development.

Conclusion: The paper illustrates a future of nuclear engineering tools being modular, lighter in computation, and more prioritized by organizations, offering a glimpse into upcoming trends for the field.

Abstract: The tools used to engineer something are just as important as the thing that
is actually being engineered. In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed
determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering,
software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for
the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes
used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to
solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their
end to end developer experience with said tools.
  The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission,
with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming
languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a
peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering.
Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and
universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the
industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in
Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes,
a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python
and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M
in a single organization.
  Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in
nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by
organizations. Access to our results in web form are available online.

### [235] [Code with Me or for Me? How Increasing AI Automation Transforms Developer Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08149)
*Valerie Chen,Ameet Talwalkar,Robert Brennan,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes the impact of coding agents versus copilots on developer productivity and experience, revealing agents' potential while addressing adoption challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how autonomous AI coding agents influence developer productivity and align with evolving software development needs, compared to copilots.

Method: Compared developer interactions with GitHub Copilot (copilot) and OpenHands (coding agent) by recruiting users of the former and observing their workflows.

Result: Coding agents can outperform copilots by completing complex tasks and reducing user effort but face usability and adoption challenges like understanding agent behaviors.

Conclusion: Agents have the potential to transform developer workflows but require improved user understanding and strategies for broader adoption to fully realize their advantages.

Abstract: Developers now have access to a growing array of increasingly autonomous AI
tools to support software development. While numerous studies have examined
developer use of copilots, which can provide chat assistance or code
completions, evaluations of coding agents, which can automatically write files
and run code, still largely rely on static benchmarks without
humans-in-the-loop. In this work, we conduct the first academic study to
explore developer interactions with coding agents and characterize how more
autonomous AI tools affect user productivity and experience, compared to
existing copilots. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding
assistants, GitHub Copilot and OpenHands, recruiting participants who regularly
use the former. Our results show agents have the potential to assist developers
in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks that humans might not
have accomplished before) and reduce the user effort required to complete
tasks. However, there are challenges involved in enabling their broader
adoption, including how to ensure users have an adequate understanding of agent
behaviors. Our results not only provide insights into how developer workflows
change as a result of coding agents but also highlight how user interactions
with agents differ from those with existing copilots, motivating a set of
recommendations for researchers building new agents. Given the broad set of
developers who still largely rely on copilot-like systems, our work highlights
key challenges of adopting more agentic systems into developer workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of generative AI on developer expertise models, using ChatGPT-generated code in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reliance on generative AI tools could diminish developers' understanding of code and affect expertise metrics.

Method: The authors analyzed statistical data from GitHub projects and simulated scenarios with varying levels of ChatGPT contribution to evaluate impacts on knowledge models and the Truck Factor algorithm.

Result: The study found that different scenarios show measurable effects on expertise metrics, demonstrating their current sensitivity to GenAI integration.

Conclusion: The integration of generative AI into software development workflows could undermine the reliability of developer expertise models.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools for source code generation
have significantly boosted productivity in software development. However, they
also raise concerns, particularly the risk that developers may rely heavily on
these tools, reducing their understanding of the generated code. We hypothesize
that this loss of understanding may be reflected in source code knowledge
models, which are used to identify developer expertise. In this work, we
present an exploratory analysis of how a knowledge model and a Truck Factor
algorithm built upon it can be affected by GenAI usage. To investigate this, we
collected statistical data on the integration of ChatGPT-generated code into
GitHub projects and simulated various scenarios by adjusting the degree of
GenAI contribution. Our findings reveal that most scenarios led to measurable
impacts, indicating the sensitivity of current expertise metrics. This suggests
that as GenAI becomes more integrated into development workflows, the
reliability of such metrics may decrease.

### [237] [Leveraging Large Language Models for Classifying App Users' Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08250)
*Yasaman Abedini,Abbas Heydarnoori*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates advanced LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b for user feedback classification across eight datasets, aiming to address challenges in labeled dataset scarcity by using these models for annotation. The study finds that guided LLMs can enhance dataset quality and boost performance of BERT classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating large, accurately labeled datasets for user feedback classification is time-consuming and resource-intensive, necessitating research into leveraging advanced language models to augment datasets and improve classifier performance.

Method: The authors conduct experiments with four advanced LLMs on eight labeled datasets comprising app store reviews, X platform posts, and forum discussions. They use LLM-generated annotations for dataset augmentation to improve BERT-based classification models.

Result: Results show that LLMs are effective when guided by prompts to classify user feedback into coarse-grained categories, and augmenting labeled datasets with LLM-generated annotations significantly enhances classification performance.

Conclusion: Advanced LLMs, with proper guidance, can serve as valuable annotation tools for augmenting datasets and improving performance of traditional classifiers like BERT in the domain of user feedback classification.

Abstract: In recent years, significant research has been conducted into classifying
application (app) user feedback, primarily relying on supervised machine
learning algorithms. However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based
on existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large
and accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources.
In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including
GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback
classification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To
achieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been
meticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews
from app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public
forums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We
analyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and
coarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily
user feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these
models as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and
app-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of
state-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that
LLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user
feedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training
dataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly
enhance classifier performance.

### [238] [Computing Floating-Point Errors by Injecting Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08467)
*Youshuai Tan,Zhanwei Zhang,Jinfu Chen,Zishuo Ding,Jifeng Xuan,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents PI-detector, a tool to efficiently compute floating-point errors by injecting small perturbations, overcoming flaws in previous tools (ATOMU and FPCC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point errors in programs can have severe consequences, especially in critical fields like aerospace and financial analysis. Detecting such errors effectively is challenging due to implementation difficulties and execution time constraints in existing methods.

Method: PI-detector introduces perturbations in atomic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) of floating-point computations and compares the results of the original and perturbed programs to evaluate errors.

Result: PI-detector outperforms existing tools, ATOMU and FPCC, by providing more accurate and efficient calculations using datasets and a complex linear system-solving test.

Conclusion: The proposed PI-detector effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling accurate and efficient detection of floating-point errors, enhancing practical applicability.

Abstract: Floating-point programs form the foundation of modern science and
engineering, providing the essential computational framework for a wide range
of applications, such as safety-critical systems, aerospace engineering, and
financial analysis. Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences.
Although floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may
trigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial
to determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend
to take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for
detecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)
difficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent
tools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU
suffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives,
operates at a considerably slower speed.
  To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named
PI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our
approach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large
condition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction),
which then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations
into the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and
compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to
compute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU
and HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental
results demonstrate that PI-detector can perform efficient and accurate
floating-point error computation.

### [239] [InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via ICL-oriented Prefix Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08523)
*Yilun Wang,Pengfei Chen,Haiyu Huang,Zilong He,Gou Tan,Chuanfu Zhang,Jingkai He,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents InferLog, an optimization technique to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) for online log parsing by tackling latency issues without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software systems produce massive logs requiring efficient parsing methods. Despite LLMs' accuracy in log parsing, privacy risks and latency issues hinder their deployment in real-time, high-volume log environments.

Method: InferLog prioritizes inference efficiency by introducing (1) a Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to optimize prefix caching and example selection, and (2) a task-tuned configuration pipeline using meta-learning to optimize LLM settings for dynamic workloads.

Result: Experimental evaluations using the Loghub dataset and vLLM show that InferLog significantly improves inference speed and efficiency compared to traditional methods while maintaining high parsing accuracy.

Conclusion: InferLog successfully addresses the latency bottleneck in LLM-based log parsing, enabling real-time application without sacrificing accuracy, while meeting industry privacy and performance needs.

Abstract: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs,
necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream
tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but
their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1)
the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of
local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements
imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to
meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they
overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing
requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.
  In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization
method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency
emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than
parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A
Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of
in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and
task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the
optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads.
The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that
InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and
markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without
compromising parsing accuracy.

*Fernando Ayach,Vitor Lameirão,Raul Leão,Jerfferson Felizardo,Rafael Sobrinho,Vanessa Borges,Patrícia Matsubara,Awdren Fontão*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores using Generative AI (GenAI) to create proto-personas during Product Discovery, finding it saves time and improves quality but has limitations in domain specificity and eliciting certain types of empathy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proto-personas are vital for early-stage Product Discovery but creating them manually is challenging, time-intensive, and prone to bias.

Method: The researchers used a prompt engineering-based method with GenAI and evaluated its performance through a case study involving 19 participants in a Lean Inception, employing mixed qualitative and quantitative methods.

Result: The approach saved time and effort, improved the quality and reusability of proto-personas, and was generally well-accepted. However, domain-specific generalizations and uneven empathy types (cognitive vs. affective/behavioral) were noted as limitations.

Conclusion: GenAI offers an efficient and effective method for proto-persona generation in software Product Discovery, but challenges like domain specificity and empathy elicitation need addressing for broader applicability.

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such
as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.
However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,
cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and
empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate
proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to
evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,
and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study
with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative
and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency
by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of
personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially
regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations
related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although
cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy
varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel
empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software
Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be
addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

*Chi-en Amy Tai,Pengyu Nie,Lukasz Golab,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates how intermediate representations, such as natural language (NL) summaries and abstract syntax trees (ASTs), can help LLMs improve code translation. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with NL summaries achieves the highest accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often produce buggy code translations, motivating the exploration of intermediate representations to enhance translation accuracy.

Method: The authors use popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR) to test several integration methods for intermediate representations, experimenting with Open Gpt4 8X7B, StarCoder, and CodeGen models, focusing on one-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting approaches.

Result: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with intermediate NL summaries achieves a significant performance boost, improving successful translations by 13.8% on the CodeNet benchmark and 6.7% on AVATAR for the best model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the baseline zero-shot prompt.

Conclusion: The study concludes that intermediate representations, particularly NL summaries used with CoT prompting, substantially enhance LLM code translation accuracy, showcasing a promising approach for improving such models.

Abstract: Studies show that large language models (LLMs) produce buggy code
translations. One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through
intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide
the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can
benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and
abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM
performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from
one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and
specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks
(CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs
best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful
translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the
zero-shot prompt.

### [242] [LLMCup: Ranking-Enhanced Comment Updating with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08671)
*Hua Ge,Juan Zhai,Minxue Pan,Fusen He,Ziyue Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents LLMCup, a framework for updating code comments using large language models (LLMs) with diverse prompt strategies and a ranking mechanism for selecting the best update. Experimental results show significant improvements over prior methods, and a user study reveals its updates can outperform human-written ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often fail to update code comments in software projects, causing inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Existing solutions like CUP and HebCup struggle with complex cases or miss vital information. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promise due to their successes in other software engineering tasks.

Method: The proposed framework, LLMCup, utilizes multiple prompt strategies to generate diverse comment update candidates with an LLM. The best candidate is chosen using a ranking model called CupRank.

Result: LLMCup outperforms state-of-the-art methods like CUP and HebCup with improvements in Accuracy (49.0%-116.9%), BLEU-4 (10.8%-20%), METEOR (4.6%), F1 (0.9%-1.9%), and SentenceBert similarity (2.1%-3.4%). It also sometimes surpasses human performance in user studies.

Conclusion: LLMCup effectively addresses the challenges of automatic comment updating, outperforming existing methods and sometimes even human performance. The framework's reliance on multiple prompt strategies and ranking improves comment quality, highlighting its potential in software engineering tasks.

Abstract: While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and
maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to
update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation
that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as
CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural
sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these
methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating,
resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update
scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging
large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in
software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and
program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic
behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment
updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on
each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel
comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies
to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a
ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements
over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy,
10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in
SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated
by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance
of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.

*Zezhen Xiang,Jingzhi Gong,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DHDA, a framework for adapting to concept drifts in configuration-performance learning systems using a dually hierarchical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle to adapt to unpredictable dynamic changes caused by global and local drifts in environments, limiting real-time performance learning.

Method: DHDA employs upper-level divisional retraining for global drifts and asynchronous lower-level local model adaptation for local drifts, combining incremental updates with periodic retraining for efficiency.

Result: DHDA demonstrated significantly improved accuracy (up to 2x better performance) while effectively adapting to concept drifts, with reasonable computational overhead.

Conclusion: DHDA provides an effective and efficient solution to learning and adapting configuration-performance models in dynamic environments, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate
configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic
environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates
will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,
which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and
local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,
existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to
these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration
performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online
configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to
these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the
local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper
level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the
local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the
lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and
adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA
combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize
redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight
software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA
achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with
up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to
improve different local models in handling concept drift.

*Trung Le,Hao Fang,Jingyuan Li,Tung Nguyen,Lu Mi,Amy Orsborn,Uygar Sümbül,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural transformer framework "SPINT" for decoding neural activity in long-term intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCI), addressing neural recording instabilities without requiring test-time alignment or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the challenge of nonstationarity in neural recordings, which hinders long-term intracortical brain-computer interface functionality for restoring motor and communication abilities in individuals with impairments.

Method: The proposed method, SPINT, uses a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural Transformer with a novel positional embedding to infer unit identities dynamically. It incorporates dynamic channel dropout for robustness to neural population variability and supports gradient-free adaptation with minimal unlabeled test data.

Result: SPINT demonstrated superior cross-session generalization in decoding tasks compared to baselines, showing robust performance without requiring test-time alignment or parameter updates across multiple datasets from the FALCON Benchmark.

Conclusion: SPINT offers a scalable and adaptive neural decoding solution for iBCI, addressing the neural instability problem and enabling robust, long-term applications without added computational burden during deployment.

Abstract: Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI) aim to decode behavior from
neural population activity, enabling individuals with motor impairments to
regain motor functions and communication abilities. A key challenge in
long-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the
composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across
recording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit
alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require
test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across
sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In
this work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural
Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on
unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel
context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers
unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording
sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows
few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from
the test session. To further promote model robustness to population
variability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for
iBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We
evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,
covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT
demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing
zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for
test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step
toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI
applications.

*Daniel K. Freeman,Brian Odegaard,Seung-Schik Yoo,Matthias Michel*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a roadmap for using transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) in humans to explore the neural basis of conscious perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations in traditional techniques like EEG, fMRI, electrical, and magnetic stimulation which lack spatial resolution and targeting capabilities for deep brain structures.

Method: The authors plan experiments utilizing tFUS, a non-invasive high-resolution brain stimulation tool, to investigate how brain activity enables conscious perception.

Result: The paper does not present experimental results but focuses on providing guidelines and planning for effective use of tFUS.

Conclusion: Transcranial focused ultrasound has the potential to revolutionize consciousness research by overcoming the limitations of traditional stimulation techniques.

Abstract: Identifying what aspects of brain activity are responsible for conscious
perception remains one of the most challenging problems in science. While
progress has been made through psychophysical studies employing EEG and fMRI,
research would greatly benefit from improved methods for stimulating the brain
in healthy human subjects. Traditional techniques for neural stimulation
through the skull, including electrical or magnetic stimulation, suffer from
coarse spatial resolution and have limited ability to target deep brain
structures with high spatial selectivity. Over the past decade, a new tool has
emerged known as transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), which enables the
human brain to be stimulated safely and non-invasively through the skull with
millimeter-scale spatial resolution, including cortical as well as deep brain
structures. This tool offers an exciting opportunity for breakthroughs in
consciousness research. Given the extensive preparation and regulatory
approvals associated with tFUS testing, careful experimental planning is
essential. Therefore, our goal here is to provide a roadmap for using tFUS in
humans for exploring the neural substrate of conscious perception.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper presents criticality, a state poised between active and inactive dynamics, as a fundamental principle for optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of how to optimize DNN dynamics for better performance and adaptability, despite rapid advancements in artificial intelligence.

Method: The researchers analyzed the dynamics of over 80 high-performing DNNs and developed a training method to explicitly drive networks toward criticality.

Result: The study found that recent improvements in AI coincided with networks unknowingly approaching criticality. Explicitly maintaining criticality improved robustness and resolved issues like performance loss in continual learning.

Conclusion: Criticality serves as a unifying principle for network dynamics and offers a theoretical basis for designing adaptable, high-performing AI systems inspired by biological brains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly through larger and deeper neural
networks, yet fundamental questions remain about how to optimize network
dynamics for performance and adaptability. This study shows that deep neural
networks (DNNs), like biological brains, perform optimally when operating near
a critical phase transition - poised between active and inactive dynamics.
Drawing from physics and neuroscience, we demonstrate that criticality provides
a unifying principle linking structure, dynamics, and function in DNNs.
Analyzing more than 80 state-of-the-art models, we first report that
improvements in accuracy over the past decade coincided with an implicit
evolution toward more critical dynamics. Architectural and training innovations
unknowingly guided networks toward this optimal regime. Second, building on
these insights, we develop a training method that explicitly drives networks to
criticality, improving robustness and performance. Third, we show that
fundamental problems in AI, including loss of performance in deep continual
learning, are caused by loss of criticality and that maintaining criticality
rescues performance. This work introduces criticality as a fundamental
framework for AI development by emphasizing dynamic optimization alongside
scale. It bridges artificial intelligence with physics and biological cortical
network function inspiring novel self-tuning strategies in DNNs. The findings
offer a theoretically grounded path forward in designing efficient, adaptable,
and high-performing artificial intelligence systems drawing inspiration from
principles observed in biological neural systems.

### [247] [Distinct neurodynamics of functional brain networks in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia as revealed by EEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08728)
*Sungwoo Ahn,Evie A. Malaia,Leonid L Rubchinsky*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) exhibit distinct neurodynamic changes, characterized by differences in brain rhythms and functional connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and differentiate the general principles of neurodynamics underlying AD and FTD for advancing understanding of these disorders.

Method: Utilizing advanced methods including spectral power analysis, Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and machine learning classification on functional brain networks.

Result: Patterns of functional connectivity and neural dynamics vary significantly between AD, FTD, and control groups across several frequency bands.

Conclusion: AD demonstrates reduced coordination and connectivity, making neural activity more random, whereas FTD shows higher coordination in neural activity outside frontal regions, offering contrasting neural signatures.

Abstract: Objective While Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
show some common memory deficits, these two disorders show partially
overlapping complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. The objective
of this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the
general principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.
  Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and
functional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures
to Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and
measures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning
techniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.
  Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network
organization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD
and FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.
  Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest
that AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across
areas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity
(except slow frontal activity).
  Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain
function in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity.
Deviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits,
which are specific to each of the disorders.

### [248] [Mallows Model with Learned Distance Metrics: Sampling and Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08108)
*Yeganeh Alimohammadi,Kiana Asgari*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generalized Mallows model that learns a distance metric from ranking data, introduces an efficient sampling algorithm, and provides a consistent estimation method validated on sports datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Mallows model rely on fixed distance metrics, limiting flexibility in varied ranking contexts. The authors aim to address this by learning the distance metric from data.

Method: The authors propose a generalization of the Mallows model using $L_\alpha$ distances, develop a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for efficient sampling, and create a Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm for joint parameter estimation.

Result: The paper provides strong consistency results for their estimators and demonstrates empirical validity of their approach on sports ranking datasets.

Conclusion: The generalized Mallows model, combined with the proposed sampling and estimation techniques, effectively addresses the limitations of fixed distance metrics in ranking data, making it applicable to diverse contexts.

Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning
from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and
voting to aligning language models with human
preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic,
rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy
perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying
exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta
\cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a
distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$
distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly
from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for
instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team
beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by
this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance
metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances:
$d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are
$\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even
in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that
required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we
propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly
estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal
distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for
any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically
using datasets from sports rankings.

### [249] [CLEAR: Calibrated Learning for Epistemic and Aleatoric Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08150)
*Ilia Azizi,Juraj Bodik,Jakob Heiss,Bin Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents CLEAR, a calibration method combining aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, achieving improved conditional coverage across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification is essential for reliable predictive modeling, especially in regression tasks, which requires addressing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Method: Introduced CLEAR, a calibration method using parameters γ₁ and γ₂, compatible with distinct aleatoric and epistemic estimators—specifically quantile regression and ensembles from the PCS framework.

Result: CLEAR demonstrated an average improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in interval width compared to individually calibrated baselines across 17 real-world datasets, while achieving nominal coverage.

Conclusion: CLEAR offers a balanced approach to combining aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, delivering better predictive intervals while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable predictive
modeling, especially in regression tasks. Existing methods typically address
either aleatoric uncertainty from measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty
from limited data, but not necessarily both in a balanced way. We propose
CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components for improved conditional
coverage. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic
estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for
aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic
uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average
improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two
individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. This
improvement can be particularly evident in scenarios dominated by either high
epistemic or high aleatoric uncertainty.

### [250] [Admissibility of Stein Shrinkage for Batch Normalization in the Presence of Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08261)
*Sofia Ivolgina,P. Thomas Fletcher,Baba C. Vemuri*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stein shrinkage estimator to improve batch normalization (BN) in deep learning, showing its advantage against adversarial attacks using multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional batch normalization statistics under adversarial attacks and to improve the mean-square-error performance of BN estimations.

Method: Application of Stein's shrinkage estimation to adjust mean and variance statistics in BN for enhanced performance and resilience to sub-Gaussian-distributed adversarial attacks.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in image classification and segmentation tasks across datasets (CIFAR-10, neuroimaging, Cityscape) with robustness to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Stein shrinkage provides a more robust alternative to traditional BN approaches, improving performance and stability, particularly when subjected to adversarial disturbances.

Abstract: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks
used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training.
BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances,
respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature
maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of
Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the
mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In
this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and
variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence
of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian
distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein
shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in
image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks.
We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a
standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using
CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using
HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.

### [251] [MIRRAMS: Towards Training Models Robust to Missingness Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08280)
*Jihye Lee,Minseo Kang,Dongha Kim*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes MIRRAMS, a deep learning framework aimed at addressing shifts in missingness distributions between training and test datasets, achieving robust prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often has missingness distributional shifts between training and test datasets, undermining model robustness.

Method: Introduced MI robustness conditions using mutual information. Proposed the MIRRAMS objective function with tailored loss terms for robustness to unseen missingness scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show MIRRAMS outperforms baselines and ensures stable performance across missingness scenarios. It also achieves state-of-the-art results on tasks without missing data.

Conclusion: The MIRRAMS framework is effective for general-purpose learning tasks and can handle semi-supervised situations while advancing robustness against missingness shifts.

Abstract: In real-world data analysis, missingness distributional shifts between
training and test input datasets frequently occur, posing a significant
challenge to achieving robust prediction performance. In this study, we propose
a novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness
distributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based
conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to
extract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse
missingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness
scenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple
yet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and
formulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information
Regularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our
analysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying
consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as
FixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that
MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable
performance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be
naturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting
MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning.

### [252] [Optimal and Practical Batched Linear Bandit Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08438)
*Sanghoon Yu,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces BLAE, a new algorithm for batched linear bandits that achieves minimax-optimal regret with low computational overhead and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to batched linear bandits either have high computational costs or lack practical efficacy, creating a need for better algorithms.

Method: The authors develop BLAE, which integrates arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, and apply novel techniques for batch-wise optimal design and refined concentration bounds.

Result: BLAE achieves provably minimax-optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors) in both large and small arm regimes, uses only O(log log T) batches, and exhibits superior empirical performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BLAE is the first algorithm to provide minimax-optimality across all regimes while also excelling in practical applications, making it a significant advance in batched linear bandits.

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem under limited adaptivity, known as the
batched linear bandit. While existing approaches can achieve near-optimal
regret in theory, they are often computationally prohibitive or underperform in
practice. We propose \texttt{BLAE}, a novel batched algorithm that integrates
arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, achieving the minimax
optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors in $T$) in both large-$K$ and
small-$K$ regimes for the first time, while using only $O(\log\log T)$ batches.
Our analysis introduces new techniques for batch-wise optimal design and
refined concentration bounds. Crucially, \texttt{BLAE} demonstrates low
computational overhead and strong empirical performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in extensive numerical evaluations. Thus,
\texttt{BLAE} is the first algorithm to combine provable minimax-optimality in
all regimes and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.

### [253] [Data Depth as a Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08518)
*Arturo Castellanos,Pavlo Mozharovskyi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces "loss depths," a new family of data depth measures derived by associating the minimum loss of classifiers like SVM or logistic regression, enabling effective high-dimensional anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine data depth measures in a way that utilizes machine learning principles, making them computationally efficient, statistically robust, and extendable to high-dimensional data.

Method: The authors reinterpret the halfspace depth as the minimal loss across classifiers and generalize it to a novel family of "loss depths," employing machine learning models for efficient computations and statistical guarantees.

Result: The proposed loss depths demonstrate computational efficiency and robust statistical convergence while proving useful for high-dimensional anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally and statistically advantageous means of measuring data depth, bridges data depth and classifier model complexity, and is effective for anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how
central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as
anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across
various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising
the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety
of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.
Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the
halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of
classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the
set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of
"loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or
logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits
computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as
their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the
high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a
connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity
of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation
as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for
anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.

*Berire Gunes Reyhan,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize ultra-reliable Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) under constraints like PAoI violation, transmit power, and schedulability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless Networked Control Systems require co-design of communication and control systems due to their interdependence, demanding reliable methods to optimize performance while ensuring constraints are satisfied.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage approach: first deriving optimality conditions via optimization theory to simplify the problem, and then implementing a safe DRL model with a teacher-student mechanism to guide decision-making under constraints.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing rule-based and DRL benchmarks, offering faster convergence, higher rewards, and greater system stability.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective solution for constraint-satisfying optimization in WNCSs, advancing the state-of-the-art in safe DRL applications.

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication
systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper
presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction
while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The
approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age
of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability
in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely
derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and
maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The
framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first
stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships
among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage
employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent
(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system
constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other
optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher
rewards, and greater stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges of class imbalance and variability in medical image segmentation, which are critical for effective wound management and automated assessment.

Method: The study integrates SCSE and spatial attention mechanisms into a dual-attention U-Net++ architecture. EfficientNet-B7 was selected as the encoder through benchmarking. Two class-specific models were trained using tailored preprocessing, data augmentation, Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, and Test Time Augmentation, with results evaluated using external weighted F1-score.

Result: The model achieved an F1-score of 0.8640 on a benchmark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition, indicating high performance for medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effectiveness in tackling variability and imbalance in medical segmentation tasks, presenting a reliable solution for complex clinical challenges.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa
significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and
automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++
archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores the use of multispectral LiDAR data and deep learning models to achieve precise segmentation of forest components, identifying six classes including foliage and woody debris. KPConv proved to be the most accurate model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for efficient and accurate forest inventory methods to support conservation and decision-making efforts.

Method: Multispectral LiDAR data from the HeliALS system providing high-density point clouds is analyzed using three 3D deep learning models (KPConv, Superpoint Transformer, Point Transformer V3) and one machine learning model (Random Forest).

Result: The KPConv model demonstrated superior accuracy with all three wavelengths as input features, resulting in significant improvements in mIoU (33.73%) and mAcc (32.35%).

Conclusion: Multispectral LiDAR holds significant promise for automating forest component segmentation with high accuracy, enabling efficient forest resource inventory and management.

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

*Xiwen Chen,Peijie Qiu,Wenhui Zhu,Hao Wang,Huayu Li,Xuanzhao Dong,Xiaotong Sun,Xiaobing Yu,Yalin Wang,Abolfazl Razi,Aristeidis Sotiras*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach to histopathological image analysis through solving instance jigsaw puzzles, aimed at improving instance correlation capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIL has limitations due to permutation invariance that prevent effective identification of spatial correlations between image instances in WSIs.

Method: A novel Siamese network solution that tackles instance jigsaw puzzles, supported by optimal transport theory.

Result: The proposed method achieved superior results in WSI classification and survival prediction tasks compared to state-of-the-art MIL approaches.

Conclusion: Restoring instance order enables better semantic correlation capture, and the method offers improved performance in complex histopathological image tasks.

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at

### [258] [Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) for Segment-Specific ICA Calcification Mapping on Non-Contrast CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08214)
*Xiangjian Hou,Ebru Yaman Akcicek,Xin Wang,Kazem Hashemizadeh,Scott Mcnally,Chun Yuan,Xiaodong Ma*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) framework for accurate segment-specific intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) quantification, addressing limitations in conventional 3D modeling methods. It achieves high precision and robustness, processing full-resolution CT volumes effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ICAC quantification fail to consider the clinical significance of calcification location and suffer from technical constraints that limit anatomical accuracy when processing 3D models.

Method: The paper reformulates ICAC quantification as a Parallel Probabilistic Landmark Localization problem along the 1D axial dimension, utilizing a Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) that processes full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices to pinpoint anatomical landmarks with independent probability distributions.

Result: The DST framework achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1 slices and 96% accuracy within a ±1 slice tolerance across a 100-patient dataset, validated via 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, it demonstrates top performance on the Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark.

Conclusion: The DST framework is the first viable tool for automated segment-specific analysis of ICAC, facilitating studies into the clinical role of location-specific biomarkers. Publicly available code will support further research in diagnosis, prognosis, and procedural planning.

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Ulzee An,Moonseong Jeong,Simon A. Lee,Aditya Gorla,Yuzhe Yang,Sriram Sankararaman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Raptor, a train-free method that generates embeddings for volumetric medical imaging data using pretrained 2D foundation models, achieving superior performance at reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of training computationally intensive models on high-dimensional volumetric imaging data and the difficulty of obtaining large datasets for medical volumes.

Method: The proposed Raptor method extracts visual tokens from 2D cross-sections of medical volumes using a pretrained 2D foundation model. These tokens are then spatially compressed via random projections to reduce complexity while preserving semantic information.

Result: Raptor outperformed state-of-the-art methods across ten medical volume tasks, achieving notable improvements in various metrics (e.g., +3% SuPreM, +14% SLIViT) while requiring no training.

Conclusion: Raptor demonstrates remarkable efficiency and versatility as a foundation for deep learning approaches in volumetric imaging, bypassing the need for computationally expensive training processes.

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

### [260] [Overview of the TREC 2021 deep learning track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08191)
*Nick Craswell,Bhaskar Mitra,Emine Yilmaz,Daniel Campos,Jimmy Lin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The 2020 TREC Deep Learning track updated its datasets significantly while reaffirming the superiority of deep neural ranking models over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the training datasets for passage and document ranking tasks and explore the performance of ranking methods in a more expansive collection.

Method: The researchers refreshed and enlarged the MS MARCO datasets and experimented with single and multistage retrieval pipelines using deep neural network models.

Result: Single stage retrieval pipelines showed promising results but were outperformed by multistage retrieval methods of deep neural networks; dataset updates raised concerns about completeness and label quality.

Conclusion: Deep neural ranking models remain dominant, but dataset updates demand further examination of judgment completeness and label reliability.

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

### [261] [CUE-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-Based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08445)
*Yaodong Su,Yixiang Fang,Yingli Zhou,Quanqing Xu,Chuanhui Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CUE-RAG, an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, addressing limitations in graph-based retrieval methods and demonstrating superior accuracy, F1 scores, and reduced costs in question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the limited domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), and the shortcomings of existing graph-based RAG methods in addressing these issues.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-partite graph index incorporating text chunks, knowledge units, and entities, combined with a hybrid extraction strategy and query-driven iterative retrieval (Q-Iter) to enhance relevance and accuracy.

Result: On QA benchmarks, CUE-RAG achieves up to 99.33% higher Accuracy, 113.51% higher F1 score, and reduces indexing costs by 72.58% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: CUE-RAG showcases effectiveness and cost-efficiency in advancing graph-based RAG systems, outperforming baselines even in instances without reliance on a Large Language Model for indexing.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of
domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from
graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from
poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of
query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index
incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic
content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy
that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated
knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy
that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph
traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy
and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.
Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM
for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency
of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

*Yixuan Cao,Zhengrong Chen,Chengxuan Xia,Kun Wu,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system for retrieving quantitative facts from unstructured documents, showing improved retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantitative facts are vital for data-driven decisions, but many such facts are hidden in unstructured text, posing accessibility challenges.

Method: The authors introduce a description-parsing framework that converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs and use weak supervision with quantity co-occurrence to enhance learning.

Result: Their method achieves a significant improvement in top-1 retrieval accuracy, from 30.98% to 64.66%, based on evaluations on financial reports and a new dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances the retrieval of quantitative information from unstructured documents, addressing a critical need in data-driven decision-making.

Abstract: Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments,
supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many
long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making
them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a
description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and
supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential
for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that
converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective
retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using
weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a
large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity
description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy
from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.

*Zhuodong Jiang,Pengju Zhang,Peter Martin*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network (EP-GAT) for stock prediction, which dynamically models stock dependencies and hierarchy, showing superior results over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural network-based methods for stock prediction fail to adapt to dynamic dependencies between stocks and struggle with maintaining hierarchical features.

Method: EP-GAT dynamically constructs a stock graph using energy differences and employs a parallel graph attention mechanism to capture hierarchical intra-stock dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments across datasets validate EP-GAT's superior performance over five competitive baselines in multiple metrics, alongside ablation and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: EP-GAT effectively addresses limitations in existing methods by modeling dynamic dependencies and hierarchical features, achieving consistent improvements in stock movement prediction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in forecasting stock
movements, which arises from learning complex inter-dependencies between stocks
and intra-dynamics of stocks. Existing approaches based on graph neural
networks typically rely on static or manually defined factors to model changing
inter-dependencies between stocks. Furthermore, these works often struggle to
preserve hierarchical features within stocks. To bridge these gaps, this work
presents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel
approach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it
generates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and
Boltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks.
Then, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the
hierarchical intra-stock dynamics. Extensive experiments on five real-world
datasets are conducted to validate the proposed approach, spanning from the US
stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, SP) and UK stock markets (FTSE, LSE). The
experimental results demonstrate that EP-GAT consistently outperforms
competitive five baselines on test periods across various metrics. The ablation
studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis further validate the
effectiveness of each module in the proposed method.

### [265] [Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) for Attacking Quantum Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08202)
*Sounak Bhowmik,Travis S. Humble,Himanshu Thapliyal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces novel Trojan attacks targeting quantum neural networks (QNNs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in deteriorating QNN performance, with accuracy dropping by 23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum neural networks are pivotal for future quantum machine learning advancements, but security and robustness of QNNs have not been adequately explored.

Method: Trojan attacks were executed using the unitary properties of quantum gates and the superposition properties enabled by Hadamard gates to inject noise and compromise QNN-based binary classifiers.

Result: The proposed Trojan attacks, termed Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs), were significantly stealthy and degraded QNN accuracy by up to 23% in the experimental setup.

Conclusion: This work represents a pioneering exploration of Trojans designed specifically for fully quantum neural networks, highlighting critical vulnerabilities and their impact on quantum computing performance.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of
quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the
quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed
Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum
gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop
Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly
stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically
QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the
compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network
independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.

TL;DR: The paper studies parametric quantum circuits (PQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML) in quantum chemistry, using two chemically meaningful datasets and testing various circuit configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore potential advantages and help address knowledge gaps in the use of PQCs for quantum chemistry datasets, an area not extensively studied.

Method: Tested 168 PQCs combining 14 data encoding techniques and 12 variational ansätze. Experiments involved state-vector simulations, noisy simulations, and real quantum hardware on 5- and 16-qubit circuits.

Result: The study highlights that applying PQCs to quantum chemistry datasets remains non-trivial, with challenges observed even in cases where classical machine learning excels.

Conclusion: While PQCs present promise for QML, significant barriers remain in applying them to challenging yet classical-problematic quantum chemistry datasets.

Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits
(PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates --
provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning
problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited
exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically
meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies
for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water
conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions
are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the
data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set
of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational
ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits.
Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model
performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth
and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the
performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both
noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings
underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that
are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain
non-trivial for quantum approaches.

### [267] [Quantum Algorithms for Projection-Free Sparse Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08543)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops quantum algorithms for sparse convex optimization in vector and matrix domains, offering significant speed-ups over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency in solving projection-free sparse convex optimization problems, which have applications in machine learning and data science.

Method: Two quantum algorithms are proposed for both vector and matrix domains, leveraging function value oracles to reduce complexity.

Result: For vector domains, quantum algorithms achieve complexities of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$, outperforming classical methods. For matrix domains, they provide complexities of $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$, reducing dependency on dimension $d$.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum algorithms demonstrate superior performance and highlight potential quantum advantages in convex optimization tasks, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: This paper considers the projection-free sparse convex optimization problem
for the vector domain and the matrix domain, which covers a large number of
important applications in machine learning and data science. For the vector
domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we propose two quantum algorithms
for sparse constraints that finds a $\varepsilon$-optimal solution with the
query complexity of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$ by using
the function value oracle, reducing a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ and $O(d)$ over
the best classical algorithm, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension. For the
matrix domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, we propose two
quantum algorithms for nuclear norm constraints that improve the time
complexity to $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$ for computing the update step, reducing at
least a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ over the best classical algorithm, where $r$ is
the rank of the gradient matrix. Our algorithms show quantum advantages in
projection-free sparse convex optimization problems as they outperform the
optimal classical methods in dependence on the dimension $d$.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The researchers identify security vulnerabilities in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems and propose a structured attack analysis model using a quantum-adapted kill chain framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in research, QML security studies are fragmented and tend to analyze threats in isolation, lacking a unified framework that captures the complexities of the QML attack surface.

Method: The paper adapts kill chain models from traditional IT security to QML and builds a taxonomy of attack vectors through comprehensive literature review, mapping them to stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework.

Result: The study outlines a detailed threat taxonomy for QML, showing interdependent attack vectors across physical and algorithmic levels, and provides a structured methodology for reasoning about multi-stage adversarial strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a foundational step toward holistic threat modeling and defense mechanisms in QML, stressing the need for multi-layered security measures in response to complex attack surfaces.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical
machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical
and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research
on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion
to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these
threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about
attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the
development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue
that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface,
capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships,
prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose
adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to
the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured
reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage
attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation,
persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we
present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding
stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE
ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between
physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data
and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and
privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This
work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive
security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust, retraining-free watermarking scheme for transformer models to safeguard intellectual properties (IP) against malicious users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safeguarding the intellectual property rights of large language models (LLMs) deployed on billions of edge devices, particularly against IP theft and malicious user attacks.

Method: The scheme generates user-specific unique keys, solves for stable watermark values through linear constraints, and applies noise mechanisms to obscure watermark locations, providing protection even in multi-user situations against collusion attacks.

Result: Experimental evaluations on three models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma) demonstrate the watermarking scheme's robustness against fine-tuning, pruning, quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix, and collusion attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed watermarking technique effectively ensures IP protection for transformer models without additional retraining or fine-tuning, proving its robustness and practicality in various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the
increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with
the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions
resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft
by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without
retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique
key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear
constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology
utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios
against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular
models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong
robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning,
quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).

integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts
framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability
detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to

*Tali Dror,Iftach Shoham,Moshe Buchris,Oren Gal,Haim Permuter,Gilad Katz,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for audio inpainting using discrete diffusion modeling with a pre-trained audio tokenizer, demonstrating superior performance on long gaps compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio inpainting methods perform inadequately when reconstructing audio gaps longer than 100 ms, necessitating more robust solutions.

Method: The paper introduces discrete diffusion modeling, where audio is tokenized via a pre-trained audio tokenizer, and the generative process is modeled in the discrete latent space.

Result: Experimental evaluation on MusicNet and MTG datasets reveals competitive or superior reconstruction quality, especially for gaps up to 500 ms.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion modeling provides a robust framework for audio inpainting, ensuring semantically coherent and stable reconstructions even for long gaps, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in
corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and
spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps,
they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this
work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion
modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a
pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process
directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically
coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the
MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap
durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset,
extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing
baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for
restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method

TL;DR: The study evaluates modern language identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) systems using mid-20th century radio recordings, finding LID systems effective but SR methods fragile and biased.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the effectiveness and biases of modern LID and SR methods when dealing with multilingual speakers and historical cross-age recordings in archival audio.

Method: Used a unique UNESCO mid-20th century radio recordings dataset to test modern off-the-shelf LID and SR systems, focusing on multilingualism and cross-age impacts.

Result: LID systems like Whisper are capable of handling second-language and accented speech better, but SR methods remain unstable and prone to biases related to age, channel, and language.

Conclusion: Improvements are needed in speaker embeddings to ensure reliability in archival applications of SR for indexing speakers.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

### [274] [MIDI-VALLE: Improving Expressive Piano Performance Synthesis Through Neural Codec Language Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08530)
*Jingjing Tang,Xin Wang,Zhe Zhang,Junichi Yamagishi,Geraint Wiggins,George Fazekas*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIDI-VALLE, a model for MIDI-to-audio synthesis that integrates neural codec techniques for superior performance over past systems, especially in piano performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIDI-to-audio synthesis systems struggle with generalization across different MIDI inputs, styles, and recording environments, calling for a more robust and consistent approach.

Method: The authors adapted the VALLE text-to-speech framework for MIDI-to-audio synthesis, including enhancements like conditioning on reference performances and encoding MIDI/audio as tokens, trained on diverse datasets.

Result: MIDI-VALLE surpassed state-of-the-art baselines with over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on test datasets and received significantly higher scores in human listening tests.

Conclusion: MIDI-VALLE effectively improves MIDI-to-audio synthesis quality and generalization, showcasing its robust and adaptable performance.

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to
capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music
performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating
expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into
audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across
diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address
these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted
from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot
personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio
synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio
performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that
rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,
facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.
Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an
extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that
MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving
over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the
listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline,
demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse

*Yuxuan Jiang,Zehua Chen,Zeqian Ju,Chang Li,Weibei Dou,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces FreeAudio, a training-free framework for generating long-form text-to-audio (T2A) content with precise timing control, showcasing quality comparable to training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2A methods struggle with complex text prompts due to limited high-quality, temporally-aligned audio-text data and inadequate synthesis quality when timing conditions are required.

Method: FreeAudio uses large language models (LLMs) to plan timing windows and recaption them. It further introduces Decoupling and Aggregating Attention Control for timing, Contextual Latent Composition for smoothness, and Reference Guidance for consistency.

Result: FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art timing-conditioned synthesis quality among training-free methods, comparable to leading training-based approaches like Stable Audio, particularly in generating long-form audio.

Conclusion: FreeAudio sets a new standard for training-free, timing-conditioned, long-form T2A synthesis, bridging the gap with training-intensive methods and enabling broader practical adoption.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent
advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and
quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle
to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,
"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation
techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable
timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is
still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled
T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled
long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping
at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time
windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based
on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and
Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent
Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.
Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art
timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is
comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates
comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and
paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are

*Gustavo Correa Publio,José Emilio Labra Gayo*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: xpSHACL is introduced as an explainable SHACL validation system that utilizes rule-based justification trees, RAG, LLMs, and a Violation KG to provide efficient and human-readable explanations for RDF data validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SHACL validation engines often produce English reports that are difficult for non-technical users to interpret, given the increasing need for proper RDF data validation in the context of growing interest in Knowledge Graphs.

Method: The paper combines rule-based justification trees, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and large language models (LLMs) to create multilanguage explanations for constraint violations. Additionally, a Violation Knowledge Graph (KG) is used for caching and reusing explanations.

Result: The xpSHACL system generates detailed and accessible explanations for RDF data validation issues, improving user understanding, especially for non-technical audiences.

Conclusion: xpSHACL enhances SHACL validation by making explanations clearer, reusable, and multilingual, leveraging advanced AI techniques and a Violation KG for better efficiency and user-friendliness.

Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF
data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users
need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and
consistency.

### [278] [Hashing for Fast Pattern Set Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08745)
*Maiju Karjalainen,Pauli Miettinen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hashing-based method to efficiently mine pattern sets by minimizing reconstruction error, showing comparable quality with standard approaches but significantly improving computational speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient methods in pattern set mining and improve reconstruction error metrics.

Method: Utilizes bottom-k hashing for pattern selection, extending the method for approximate pattern appearances in data.

Result: The hashing-based approach achieves faster execution while maintaining quality comparable to traditional greedy algorithms, demonstrated across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances efficiency and quality, making it a viable solution for various applications like database tiling and Boolean matrix factorization.

Abstract: Pattern set mining, which is the task of finding a good set of patterns
instead of all patterns, is a fundamental problem in data mining. Many
different definitions of what constitutes a good set have been proposed in
recent years. In this paper, we consider the reconstruction error as a proxy
measure for the goodness of the set, and concentrate on the adjacent problem of
how to find a good set efficiently. We propose a method based on bottom-k
hashing for efficiently selecting the set and extend the method for the common
case where the patterns might only appear in approximate form in the data. Our
approach has applications in tiling databases, Boolean matrix factorization,
and redescription mining, among others. We show that our hashing-based approach
is significantly faster than the standard greedy algorithm while obtaining
almost equally good results in both synthetic and real-world data sets.

*Yohann De Castro,Rémi Gribonval,Nicolas Jouvin*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO), a TV-regularized method for sparse measure recovery, tackling limitations in previous works using a novel kernel switching mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of local positive curvature (LPC) assumptions needed in prior estimation error bounds while enabling more flexibility in using diverse kernels for recovery.

Method: The kernel switch mechanism is introduced, allowing usage of any LPC kernel as a pivot while verifying embedding conditions. New LPC kernels, such as the 'sinc-4' kernel, are validated for signal recovery and mixture problems.

Result: Kernel switching increases kernel options for applications, proves 'sinc-4' kernel satisfies LPC, and shows that BLASSO error reduces with noise, improving previous fixed-error models.

Conclusion: Kernel switching significantly enhances BLASSO's applicability and accuracy by expanding LPC-compatible kernels, improving error bounds, and supporting practical applications in translation-invariant mixture models.

Abstract: This paper advances the general theory of continuous sparse regularisation on
measures with the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO). This TV-regularized convex program
on the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy
observation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have
uncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in
order to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local
positive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In
practice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved.
At the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the
model kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known
LPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding
conditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list
of LPC-kernels, proving that the "sinc-4" kernel, used for signal recovery and
mixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show
that the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the
noise level, leading to effective near regions. This improves on known results
where this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel.
We illustrate the interest of our results in the case of translation-invariant
mixture model estimation, using bandlimiting smoothing and sketching techniques
to reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series, aiding in informed trading decisions and outperforming current sentiment-based strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial strategies using LLMs rely largely on sentiment and trend observation, lacking structured model-building approaches for informed trading.

Method: An agentic system is designed using LLMs to iteratively identify stochastic differential equations for analyzing financial time series and generating risk metrics for trading decisions.

Result: Model-informed trading strategies created using their system improve Sharpe ratios when compared to alternatives, supported by evaluations in backtests and a market simulator.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with structured agentic model discovery improves market analysis, enhances risk estimation, and outperforms standard LLM-based trading approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks,
in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal.
While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in
finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead
on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an
agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential
equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which
inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional
backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally
plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading
strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across
multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model
discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading
decisions.

Motivation: To validate and extend the reproducibility and applicability of DiffFluid in fluid dynamics simulations, particularly for methods like the Lattice Boltzmann.

Method: Replication and application of DiffFluid's DDPM framework to other fluid dynamics simulation methods, assessing computational performance and scalability.

Result: Successful replication and evidence of the model's flexibility as a general-purpose solver, alongside identifying challenges in computational efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: Diffusion models paired with Transformers show promise for fluid dynamics, but future work is needed to optimize computational efficiency and scalability for broader applications.

Abstract: In this work, we aimed to replicate and extend the results presented in the
DiffFluid paper[1]. The DiffFluid model showed that diffusion models combined
with Transformers are capable of predicting fluid dynamics. It uses a denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework to tackle Navier-Stokes and
Darcy flow equations. Our goal was to validate the reproducibility of the
methods in the DiffFluid paper while testing its viability for other simulation
types, particularly the Lattice Boltzmann method. Despite our computational
limitations and time constraints, this work provides evidence of the
flexibility and potential of the model as a general-purpose solver for fluid
dynamics. Our results show both the potential and challenges of applying
diffusion models to complex fluid dynamics problems. This work highlights the
opportunities for future research in optimizing the computational efficiency
and scaling such models in broader domains.

Motivation: Lung cancer prognosis with CT imaging requires large labeled datasets for supervised learning models, which limits application in scenarios with limited annotations.

Method: The study analyzed CT scans from 977 patients, extracting 1218 radiomics features and performing dimensionality reduction with 56 feature selection methods. A semi-supervised learning framework utilized labeled and unlabeled data, with cross-validation and external testing performed using SHAP analysis for model interpretability.

Result: SSL outperformed SL, improving survival prediction by 17% with top accuracy of 0.90 in cross-validation and 0.88 in external datasets. SSL performed well even with 10% labeled data, showing better stability and lower variance than SL.

Conclusion: The proposed SSL framework is cost-effective, stable, and interpretable, leveraging unlabeled data for improved survival prediction in lung cancer, demonstrating enhanced generalizability and clinical value.

Abstract: Background: CT imaging is vital for lung cancer management, offering detailed
visualization for AI-based prognosis. However, supervised learning SL models
require large labeled datasets, limiting their real-world application in
settings with scarce annotations.
  Methods: We analyzed CT scans from 977 patients across 12 datasets extracting
1218 radiomics features using Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet filters via
PyRadiomics Dimensionality reduction was applied with 56 feature selection and
extraction algorithms and 27 classifiers were benchmarked A semi supervised
learning SSL framework with pseudo labeling utilized 478 unlabeled and 499
labeled cases Model sensitivity was tested in three scenarios varying labeled
data in SL increasing unlabeled data in SSL and scaling both from 10 percent to
100 percent SHAP analysis was used to interpret predictions Cross validation
and external testing in two cohorts were performed.
  Results: SSL outperformed SL, improving overall survival prediction by up to
17 percent. The top SSL model, Random Forest plus XGBoost classifier, achieved
0.90 accuracy in cross-validation and 0.88 externally. SHAP analysis revealed
enhanced feature discriminability in both SSL and SL, especially for Class 1
survival greater than 4 years. SSL showed strong performance with only 10
percent labeled data, with more stable results compared to SL and lower
variance across external testing, highlighting SSL's robustness and cost
effectiveness.
  Conclusion: We introduced a cost-effective, stable, and interpretable SSL
framework for CT-based survival prediction in lung cancer, improving
performance, generalizability, and clinical readiness by integrating SHAP

TL;DR: AmpLyze predicts HC50 (red-blood-cell lysis) values for antimicrobial peptides, making toxicity screening more quantitative, interpretable, and sequence-based.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a more precise tool to evaluate the hemolysis safety profile of AMP therapeutics, surpassing the binary classification of 'toxic' or 'non-toxic'.

Method: AmpLyze employs ProtT5/ESM2 residue embeddings and sequence-level descriptors combined in dual local-global branches, aligned via cross-attention and trained using log-cosh loss.

Result: Achieved a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming previous models. Ablations validated the importance of both branches and cross-attention.

Conclusion: AmpLyze enables safer and more precise AMP design by offering interpretable, sequence-based hemolysis predictions, aiding early-stage toxicity assessment.

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for
antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic"
or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value
from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model
couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in
dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained
with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model
reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors
and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,
and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.
Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest
safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,
sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design
and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.

TL;DR: A Bayesian inference-based model calibrates and quantifies prediction uncertainty in Hall thruster performance across varying background pressures, achieving significant accuracy and error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance predictive accuracy and understand Hall thruster performance variability across different vacuum test facilities and background pressures.

Method: The study employs Bayesian inference to calibrate a multi-component model incorporating cathode, discharge, and plume simulations for magnetically shielded and unshielded thrusters.

Result: The calibrated model achieves predictive accuracy within 10%, reduces errors by over 50% compared to prior work, and performs extrapolations with an error rate of 9%.

Conclusion: The calibrated model effectively captures performance trends and reduces prediction errors, with potential for further refinement and extensions in predictive modeling of Hall thrusters.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction
uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model at varying
facility background pressures. The model, consisting of a cathode model,
discharge model, and plume model, is used to simulate two thrusters across a
range of background pressures in multiple vacuum test facilities. The model
outputs include thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma
properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume.
The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster, the H9, and
an unshielded thruster, the SPT-100. After calibration, the model captures
several key performance trends with background pressure, including changes in
thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the
model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates
and pressures not included in the training data, and the model can predict some
performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range.
Evaluated on the same data as prior work [Eckels et al. 2024], the model
reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%.
An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9\%,
capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. Possible extensions and
improvements are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall
thruster modeling across vacuum facilities.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) for thematic analysis in mental health interviews versus traditional human analysis, finding that LLMs are cost-effective but lack human depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can address the resource-intensive nature of traditional thematic analysis in large healthcare studies while maintaining analytical quality.

Method: The study used OpenAI's GPT-4 model combined with the RISEN prompt engineering framework and compared its performance with human analysis in a stress-reduction trial for healthcare workers by coding, synthesizing themes, and noting coding saturation.

Result: LLMs with the RISEN framework created deductive parent codes akin to humans, achieved coding saturation with fewer transcripts, and showed strong inter-rater reliability. However, humans outperformed in developing nuanced child codes, synthesizing themes, and creating detailed outputs.

Conclusion: LLMs are a cost-effective alternative for large-scale thematic analysis but require human oversight to ensure depth and nuance, particularly in mental healthcare research.

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

TL;DR: This paper presents SSSUMO, a semi-supervised deep learning approach for submovement decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submovement analysis can provide valuable insights into motor control, but existing methods have issues like poor reconstruction accuracy, high computational cost, and difficulty in validation due to the scarcity of hand-labeled data.

Method: The authors use a semi-supervised learning framework that starts with synthetic data generated by minimum-jerk principles. This data is refined iteratively by adapting to unlabeled data. A fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction is used.

Result: SSSUMO outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and human motion datasets, showcasing robustness in noise and achieving real-time performance under a millisecond per input second.

Conclusion: SSSUMO's capabilities open up new possibilities in applications such as human-computer interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies, with provided code and pre-trained models available publicly.

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on user behavior on SERPs often uses mouse movements as low-cost proxies but relies on self-reported labels, which are prone to inaccuracies and biases.

Method: The authors use eye trackers to objectively capture continuous visual attention during SERP interactions, collecting data from 47 participants for 2,776 transactional queries along with additional metadata and preprocessing tools.

Result: The resulting dataset includes comprehensive features: HTML source files, rendered SERP screenshots, eye and mouse movement data, advertisement bounding boxes, and preprocessing scripts, along with baseline experiments for classification tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable and reliable resource for studying user behavior on SERPs and serves as a foundation for diverse future research possibilities in this area.

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing
behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on
mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied
on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be
inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye
tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention.
Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected
from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images;
(2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data;
(5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6)
scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an

*Md. Saif Hassan Onim,Andrew M. Kiselica,Himanshu Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a study on detecting emotions in older adults using wearable sensor data, achieving promising results in terms of prediction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of emotional well-being in older adults, particularly those in healthcare settings, while ensuring a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving method.

Method: The approach uses physiological signals from wearable devices (Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+) to predict emotional states through classical machine learning methods without relying on cameras or facial analysis.

Result: The method achieved an r2 score of 0.782 and an MSE of 0.0006, demonstrating strong predictive performance using physiological data.

Conclusion: The study validates that non-obtrusive wearable sensor data can efficiently and privately capture emotional states, with potential applications for individuals with ADRD and PTSD.

Abstract: Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their
cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living
environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive
approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals
obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older
individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from
the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were
recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial
Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion
categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion
recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without
the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging
classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional
responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2
score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has
significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical
regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for
privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world
settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance home rehabilitation by addressing challenges like proper exercise execution, privacy concerns, and compliance with new AI regulations, leveraging advanced AI technologies.

Method: The AIRS system incorporates a smartphone-based 3D reconstruction tool, a body-matched avatar for visual feedback, intelligent navigation, and large vision-language models. It ensures proper video recordings and provides both visual and language-based feedback for exercises.

Result: AIRS was evaluated using 263 video recordings and demonstrated practical applications in guiding patients post-total knee replacement. It also supports users with disabilities and offers customization potential.

Conclusion: AIRS is an innovative and modular rehabilitation framework with demonstrable effectiveness, addressing both technical and compliance challenges, and is adaptable to broader rehabilitation needs.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS)
framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home
rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,
including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for
machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is
demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement
(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A
smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual
and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted
to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for
further use and customization.

### [291] [Entity-Specific Cyber Risk Assessment using InsurTech Empowered Risk Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08193)
*Jiayi Guo,Zhiyun Quan,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel framework incorporating machine learning to enhance cyber incident prediction and frequency estimation by integrating entity-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of high-quality, publicly available cyber incident datasets due to organizations' reluctance to disclose such data, hindering better empirical research and risk modeling.

Method: The researchers developed machine learning models for both multi-label classification (cyber incident type prediction) and multi-output regression (annual frequency estimation), utilizing entity-specific attributes and interpretable ML techniques.

Result: The enhanced framework significantly improved the robustness of predictions and frequency estimations when compared to using conventional risk factors. No notable dependencies among incident types were observed in datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed InsurTech framework enriches cyber risk assessment with transparent, entity-specific profiles, offering actionable insights for insurers and organizations to improve underwriting and proactive risk management.

Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research
and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due
to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their
reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,
potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber
incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to
optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven
methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational
features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a
novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with
entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a
multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident
types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and
Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual
frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore
dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations
are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML
techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by
InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance
prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only
using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent,
entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and
proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with
data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.

*Md Sadman Sakib Rahman,Yuhang Li,Xilin Yang,Shiqi Chen,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates large-scale nonlinear computation using linear optics through optimized diffractive processors, avoiding nonlinear optical materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of weak and energy-intensive optical nonlinearities and unlock possibilities for ultrafast and parallel optical computing.

Method: Phase of optical wavefront encoded via spatial light modulators (SLMs) transformed by optimized passive diffractive structures with spatially varying point-spread functions.

Result: Numerically demonstrated computation of one million nonlinear functions at wavelength-scale density, and experimentally approximated 35 nonlinear functions using SLM and image sensor.

Conclusion: Diffractive optical processors provide a scalable platform for universal nonlinear function approximation, enabling advancements in analog optical computing.

Abstract: Nonlinear computation is essential for a wide range of information processing
tasks, yet implementing nonlinear functions using optical systems remains a
challenge due to the weak and power-intensive nature of optical nonlinearities.
Overcoming this limitation without relying on nonlinear optical materials could
unlock unprecedented opportunities for ultrafast and parallel optical computing
systems. Here, we demonstrate that large-scale nonlinear computation can be
performed using linear optics through optimized diffractive processors composed
of passive phase-only surfaces. In this framework, the input variables of
nonlinear functions are encoded into the phase of an optical wavefront, e.g.,
via a spatial light modulator (SLM), and transformed by an optimized
diffractive structure with spatially varying point-spread functions to yield
output intensities that approximate a large set of unique nonlinear functions,
all in parallel. We provide proof establishing that this architecture serves as
a universal function approximator for an arbitrary set of bandlimited nonlinear
functions, also covering multi-variate and complex-valued functions. We also
numerically demonstrate the parallel computation of one million distinct
nonlinear functions, accurately executed at wavelength-scale spatial density at
the output of a diffractive optical processor. Furthermore, we experimentally
validated this framework using in situ optical learning and approximated 35
unique nonlinear functions in a single shot using a compact setup consisting of
an SLM and an image sensor. These results establish diffractive optical
processors as a scalable platform for massively parallel universal nonlinear
function approximation, paving the way for new capabilities in analog optical
computing based on linear materials.

*Florian Grötschla,Luis Müller,Jan Tönshoff,Mikhail Galkin,Bryan Perozzi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AgentsNet proposes a benchmarking tool to assess multi-agent systems, especially in LLMs, on problem-solving and communication efficiency over various network topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capacity of multi-agent large language models to effectively self-organize, collaborate, and communicate within different network sizes.

Method: Development of AgentsNet benchmark inspired by distributed systems and graph theory to test LLMs across unlimited network sizes, coupled with evaluations on existing methods and frontier models.

Result: Smaller network sizes show promising performance from frontier LLMs; however, scalability issues arise as network size increases past currently tested limits.

Conclusion: AgentsNet is a scalable benchmarking solution that reveals limitations and capabilities of multi-agent systems, paving the way for improved LLMs handling large networks.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving
capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the
advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a
complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While
measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well
multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these
systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose
AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration
from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet
measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies
for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a
network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet
including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic
protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs
are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to
fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent
benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size
and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier
models in a setup with up to 100 agents.

*Samuel Teuber,Mattias Ulbrich,André Platzer,Bernhard Beckert*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic (HDL), a framework that modularly combines reasoning from distinct program logics for verifying systems involving multiple programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systems involving multiple programming languages are complex to specify and verify due to the heterogeneous nature of their components.

Method: The authors developed HDL by formalizing dynamic theories, enabling modular lifting and combination of logics, and implemented it in Isabelle with proofs of soundness and relative completeness.

Result: HDL was validated by verifying a case study where a Java controller interacts with a plant model, bridging Java dynamic logic and differential dynamic logic.

Conclusion: HDL enables modular, compositional reasoning about heterogeneous systems, facilitating reuse of proof infrastructures and simplifying multi-language system verification.

Abstract: Formally specifying, let alone verifying, properties of systems involving
multiple programming languages is inherently challenging. We introduce
Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic (HDL), a framework for combining reasoning
principles from distinct (dynamic) program logics in a modular and
compositional way. HDL mirrors the architecture of satisfiability modulo
theories (SMT): Individual dynamic logics, along with their calculi, are
treated as dynamic theories that can be flexibly combined to reason about
heterogeneous systems whose components are verified using different program
logics. HDL provides two key operations: Lifting extends an individual dynamic
theory with new program constructs (e.g., the havoc operation or regular
programs) and automatically augments its calculus with sound reasoning
principles for the new constructs; and Combination enables cross-language
reasoning in a single modality via Heterogeneous Dynamic Theories, facilitating
the reuse of existing proof infrastructure. We formalize dynamic theories,
their lifting and combination in Isabelle, and prove the soundness of all proof
rules. We also prove relative completeness theorems for lifting and
combination: Under common assumptions, reasoning about lifted or combined
theories is no harder than reasoning about the constituent dynamic theories and
their common first-order structure (i.e., the "data theory"). We demonstrate
HDL's utility by verifying an automotive case study in which a Java controller
(formalized in Java dynamic logic) steers a plant model (formalized in
differential dynamic logic).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to monitor and analyze daily activities of older adults living independently using personalized solutions involving sensors, interviews, and contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of life for a growing population of older adults living independently by providing personalized and context-aware solutions.

Method: The framework integrates sensor data with contextual information, creates formal models personalized for each participant, and uses Linear Temporal Logic and model checking to verify and analyze specific requirements.

Result: The framework is shown to be generalizable across participants and can identify violations of personalized requirements, thereby enhancing safety and well-being.

Conclusion: The approach presents a scalable method to enhance independent living for older adults, focusing on personalized care and well-being.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing
population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that
focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context
are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning
about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at
home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information
that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological
observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models,
personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context.
We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties
encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each
property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a
counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate
the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants,
highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults
ageing in place.

*Nan Li,Qi Sun,Lehan Wang,Xiaofei Xu,Jinri Huang,Chunhui Liu,Jing Gao,Yuhong Huang,Chih-Lin I*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for integrating AI natively into 6G radio access networks (RAN) to manage complexity and enhance performance, validated through successful large-scale trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the desire to natively integrate AI/ML into 6G networks to address the complexity of the network and support ubiquitous AI applications, unlike the add-on approach to AI in 5G.

Method: The authors explore the design and standardization principles for AI-Native RAN in 6G, focusing on Day 1 architecture, functionalities, and capabilities. They propose three essential capabilities: AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable AI lifecycle management, and AI-as-a-Service provisioning. A large-scale field trial was conducted to validate the framework.

Result: The proposed AI-Native RAN framework showed significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause identification, and network energy consumption during trials with over 5000 5G-A base stations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by offering a Day 1 framework for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization that balances technical innovation with practical feasibility for deployment.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain
and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not
natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G
shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support
ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and
standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and
standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,
with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and
capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its
three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization
direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable
AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The
standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including
an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale
field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered
significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause
identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture
and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework
for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation
with practical deployment.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes KP-A, a unified Network Knowledge Plane, to streamline intelligence tasks in autonomous 6G networks, enhancing interoperability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in current isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines for autonomous 6G networks, enabling a unified approach inspired by Open-RAN's service model unification.

Method: The authors propose KP-A, a decoupled knowledge acquisition and management system, which unifies and interfaces with network intelligence while demonstrating its application through specific tasks like live knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration.

Result: The proposed KP-A system demonstrated effective application in two use-cases, providing intuitive and standardized knowledge access for intelligence tasks, and showing promise for reproducibility and standardization.

Conclusion: KP-A enhances efficiency, reduces maintenance complexity, and improves interoperability in autonomous 6G networks, paving the way for future standardization and reproducible innovations.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling
autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including
self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current
implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge
retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent
interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN
(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified
Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.
By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence
logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for
intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge
interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence
agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live
network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation
artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future
standardization efforts.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework, TIER, to enhance gravitational wave detection by utilizing extended strain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines using additional strain data beyond the immediate vicinity of candidate signals.

Method: ML classifiers were trained on sparse summary features from extended strain data to evaluate candidate signals without requiring new injection campaigns.

Result: Using TIER, up to ~20% improvement in sensitive volume time was achieved in LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, especially for high masses and unequal mass ratios.

Conclusion: TIER enhances detection significance for near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates, particularly in challenging ranges like the pair-instability and intermediate-mass black hole mass regime.

Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for
improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically,
search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a
candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain
data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable
complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently
captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary
representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train
and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and
without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our
model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search
pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$
pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in
LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high
masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the
significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates,
especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole
(IMBH) ranges.

*Michael Galarnyk,Veer Kejriwal,Agam Shah,Yash Bhardwaj,Nicholas Meyer,Anand Krishnan,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset to evaluate financial influencers' recommendations and tests large language models (LLMs) for financial discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the influence of financial influencers on social media, as their impact goes beyond text-based financial analysis and includes multimodal cues like tone and delivery.

Method: The authors created the VideoConviction dataset with expert annotations and benchmarked the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as well as text-only LLMs in financial discourse.

Result: Multimodal inputs improved stock ticker extraction, but both MLLMs and LLMs struggled to discern investment actions and conviction. Betting against financial influencers’ recommendations yielded higher returns but involved higher risks.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark facilitate evaluation and development of multimodal financial models; however, both MLLMs and LLMs need improvement in capturing nuanced financial signals.

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our

*Yibo Lyu,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Yijie Zhu,Weili Guan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces PUMA, a solution to make Unified Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) more efficient by using layer pruning and modality-adaptive learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of multimedia content demands efficient methods for Unified Multimodal Retrieval, but current approaches using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are expensive and inefficient.

Method: PUMA uses Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation to reduce the parameters of MLLMs and Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss) to enhance learning efficiency by differentiating between intra-modality and inter-modality negatives.

Result: Experiments validate that PUMA significantly lowers resource consumption without sacrificing performance in multimodal retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: PUMA achieves an efficient balance of computational cost and retrieval accuracy by leveraging structural pruning and modality-specific learning adjustments.

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for image-text matching by using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to create Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), enabling better alignment between visual and textual modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve alignment between visual and textual modalities, which traditionally differ in representations, by leveraging rich semantic descriptions generated by multimodal language models.

Method: The framework includes two alignment strategies: (1) Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with Visual Semantic Descriptions to enhance their expressiveness, and (2) Prototype-level alignment using VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Flickr30K and MSCOCO show significant performance improvements. The method also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to tasks in domains like news and remote sensing.

Conclusion: Using multimodal large language models as visual semantic parsers effectively bridges the modality gap in image-text matching, offering both improved performance and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FlowDrag introduces an advanced drag-based editing method that enhances object manipulation by addressing geometric inconsistency issues through 3D mesh deformation and image projection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the geometric inconsistency in current drag-based editing methods that lead to artifacts and unstable outcomes.

Method: Constructing a 3D mesh from the image, utilizing an energy function to guide deformation, and integrating mesh displacements into a UNet denoising process for precise alignment.

Result: FlowDrag achieves accurate point alignment with preserved structural integrity and outperforms existing methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlowDrag provides a significant improvement in drag-based editing by leveraging geometry and introducing a ground-truth benchmark for performance evaluation.

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline to create a synthetic large-scale 3D visual instruction dataset to improve the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in recognizing camera-object relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs are inadequate at capturing relationships like object orientation and camera viewpoint because training data lacks sufficient diversity and precise textual descriptions.

Method: The authors introduce a synthetic generation pipeline that uses 3D assets, advanced rendering, diffusion-based image generation models, and large language models for creating photorealistic images and text prompts.

Result: A new dataset, 'Ultimate3D,' with 240K VQAs and detailed camera-object annotations significantly boosts MLLMs' performance, with a reported 33.4% accuracy improvement on camera-object recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The methodology and dataset developed in the study will advance the capabilities of MLLMs and serve broader applications. Their code, dataset, and benchmarks aim to support further research in this area.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the profitability and energy efficiency of AI data centers by integrating renewable energy sources and optimizing their operation within electricity markets.

Method: The method involves co-optimizing AI workload scheduling, on-site renewable energy usage, and active participation in wholesale and retail electricity markets to maximize economic benefits.

Result: Empirical evaluations with real-world data demonstrated significant profit increases through the integration of colocation with renewables and efficient energy management strategies.

Conclusion: The study concludes that colocating AI data centers with renewable energy sources and employing the proposed EMS can significantly boost economic outcomes and promote sustainable practices.

Abstract: We develop an energy management system (EMS) for artificial intelligence (AI)
data centers with colocated renewable generation. Under a profit-maximizing
framework, the EMS of renewable-colocated data center (RCDC) co-optimizes AI
workload scheduling, on-site renewable utilization, and electricity market
participation. Within both wholesale and retail market participation models,
the economic benefit of the RCDC operation is maximized. Empirical evaluations
using real-world traces of electricity prices, data center power consumption,
and renewable generation demonstrate significant profit gains from renewable

### [305] [Consciousness as a Jamming Phase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08197)
*Kaichen Ouyang*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural jamming phase diagram to model the emergence of consciousness in large language models, using analogies with jamming transitions in physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the emergence of generalized intelligence and consciousness in large language models, and provide a physical explanation for their empirical scaling laws.

Method: The authors establish analogies between jamming transitions in granular matter and neural networks, defining three control parameters: temperature, volume fraction, and stress.

Result: The paper finds that computational cooling, density optimization, and noise reduction lead systems to a critical jamming surface, where key properties like shared critical hallmarks and scaling exponents emerge.

Conclusion: Consciousness in neural networks is characterized as a jamming phase, which connects knowledge components via long-range correlations, analogous to physical jamming transitions.

Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the
emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in
high-dimensional disordered systems.By establishing analogies with jamming
transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three
fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks:
temperature, volume fraction, and stress.The theory provides a unified physical
explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence,
demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise
reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where
generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles
that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence
of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures
including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains
neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting
consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge
components via long-range correlations.
