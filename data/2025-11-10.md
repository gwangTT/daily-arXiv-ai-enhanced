### [1] [A hybrid solution approach for the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04685)

### [2] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for predictive models to abstain in cases of high epistemic uncertainty due to insufficient data, using regret minimization in a Bayesian setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop predictive models that can effectively handle high predictive uncertainty, especially when training data is limited, by introducing a mechanism to abstain from unreliable predictions.

Method: The method involves redefining optimal predictors using Bayesian learning to minimize expected regret. The predictor abstains when regret for a given input surpasses a predefined rejection cost, accounting for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: The introduced epistemic reject-option predictor identifies inputs with insufficient data for reliable predictions, advancing predictive model reliability in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: This framework provides a principled and robust approach for predictive models to manage uncertainty by abstaining from unreliable predictions due to epistemic uncertainty, ensuring more confident decision-making in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

### [3] [DMA: Online RAG Alignment with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04880)
*Yu Bai,Yukai Miao,Dawei Wang,Li Chen,Fei Long,Rundi Zhai,Dan Li,Yanyu Ren,Tianfeng Liu,Hongtao Xie,Ce Yang,Xuhui Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA) to improve real-time adaptation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by leveraging human feedback and optimizing ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of static retrieval in RAG systems, which limits their adaptability to evolving user intent and content drift.

Method: DMA incorporates document-, list-, and response-level human feedback into a unified learning pipeline using supervised ranker training, policy optimization, and knowledge distillation for efficient serving.

Result: Online evaluation demonstrated improved human engagement during industrial deployment, while offline testing indicated competitive retrieval and gains on conversational QA benchmarks like TriviaQA and HotpotQA.

Conclusion: DMA provides a robust framework for real-time feedback-driven adaptation in RAG systems, improving responsiveness without compromising foundational capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

### [4] [Real-Time Reasoning Agents in Evolving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04898)
*Yule Wen,Yixin Ye,Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces real-time reasoning for agents in dynamic environments and proposes AgileThinker, a model combining reactive and planning approaches for better balance between reasoning depth and response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents must make logical and timely judgments in evolving environments, where dynamic factors like hazards and opportunities continuously emerge.

Method: Two agent paradigms are explored: reactive agents using bounded reasoning for quick responses, and planning agents using extended reasoning for complex tasks. A new model, AgileThinker, integrates both paradigms to enhance performance under time pressure.

Result: Experiments reveal state-of-the-art models struggle with logical and timely decisions. AgileThinker outperforms single-paradigm agents across diverse dynamic scenarios with increasing difficulty.

Conclusion: Real-time reasoning is established as critical for practical agents, with AgileThinker demonstrating better adaptability and robustness in balancing reasoning and response latency.

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

### [5] [ORCHID: Orchestrated Retrieval-Augmented Classification with Human-in-the-Loop Intelligent Decision-Making for High-Risk Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04956)
*Maria Mahbub,Vanessa Lama,Sanjay Das,Brian Starks,Christopher Polchek,Saffell Silvers,Lauren Deck,Prasanna Balaprakash,Tirthankar Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORCHID, a modular system for high-risk property classification at the DOE, improving accuracy and traceability through a combination of human oversight and AI-driven processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address inefficiencies in traditional workflows for HRP classification at DOE sites, which are time-consuming and fail to keep up with changing regulatory policies.

Method: ORCHID employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with cooperative agents for classification, using tools like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and audit artifacts in compliance workflows.

Result: ORCHID achieves higher accuracy and traceability compared to traditional methods, while deferring uncertain cases to human experts and demonstrating grounded citations and exportable audits.

Conclusion: ORCHID represents a significant advancement in trustworthy and transparent LLM-assisted compliance systems for sensitive regulatory environments.

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use
equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export
control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional
expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep
pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic
system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM
assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

### [6] [Autonomous generation of different courses of action in mechanized combat operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05182)
*Johan Schubert,Patrik Hansen,Pontus Hörling,Ronnie Johansson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a methodology for decision-making in military ground combat operations, focusing on generating and evaluating action alternatives for better outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making processes during military ground combat operations by providing systematically evaluated recommendations for courses of action.

Method: The methodology generates thousands of individual action alternatives, evaluates them concurrently, considers multiple situational factors, and updates decisions dynamically as combat conditions change.

Result: The approach identifies courses of action with superior outcomes, factoring in variables like opponent status, unit composition, and anticipated advance rates.

Conclusion: A sequential decision-making framework aids in adapting strategies dynamically during combat for more informed decisions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

### [7] [Cleaning Maintenance Logs with LLM Agents for Improved Predictive Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05311)
*Valeriu Dimidov,Faisal Hawlader,Sasan Jafarnejad,Raphaël Frank*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in automating the cleaning process of noisy maintenance logs for predictive maintenance (PdM) in the automotive sector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like economic constraints, limited dataset availability, and expertise shortages that hinder the adoption of predictive maintenance (PdM) in the automotive industry.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs on cleaning maintenance logs containing six types of noise (e.g., typos, missing data, duplicates, incorrect dates) to assess their capability to handle generic cleaning tasks.

Result: LLMs were found effective at handling generic cleaning tasks, though less successful with domain-specific errors, highlighting opportunities for further refinement through specialized training.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for bridging gaps in PdM adoption, but require domain-specific enhancements to fully address industry-specific cleaning challenges.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

### [8] [Reasoning Is All You Need for Urban Planning AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05375)
*Sijie Yang,Jiatong Li,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new AI framework for urban planning that integrates reasoning and collaboration abilities to enhance decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create AI agents that can assist in urban planning by reasoning about constraints, stakeholder values, and trade-offs while being transparent, efficient, and compliant with rules.

Method: The framework consists of three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) and six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision), relying on a multi-agent collaboration system.

Result: The framework enables AI agents to systematically explore solutions, comply with regulations, deliberate trade-offs, and augment human decision-making in urban planning.

Conclusion: Reasoning-capable AI agents can enhance human planners' abilities by providing explainable, rule-grounded, and value-based insights, setting a foundation for advancing AI-assisted urban decision-making.

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.

### [9] [Efficient Deployment of CNN Models on Multiple In-Memory Computing Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04682)
*Eleni Bougioukou,Theodore Antonakopoulos*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper explores using an In-Memory Computing Emulator (IMCE) with multiple Processing Units (PUs) to enhance the performance of CNN models, introducing a novel Load-Balance-Longest-Path (LBLP) algorithm to optimize task allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data movement inefficiencies and increase computational efficiency in deploying CNNs on IMC-based hardware.

Method: Introduced and evaluated the LBLP algorithm on an IMC Emulator (IMCE) to dynamically allocate CNN tasks to multiple Processing Units (PUs) for better processing rate and reduced latency.

Result: Experimental results show that the LBLP algorithm outperforms alternative scheduling strategies in terms of computational performance and latency reduction for CNN models.

Conclusion: The LBLP algorithm efficiently optimizes task allocation in IMC systems, making CNN deployment more effective with better processing rates and lower latencies.

Abstract: In-Memory Computing (IMC) represents a paradigm shift in deep learning
acceleration by mitigating data movement bottlenecks and leveraging the
inherent parallelism of memory-based computations. The efficient deployment of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on IMC-based hardware necessitates the use
of advanced task allocation strategies for achieving maximum computational
efficiency. In this work, we exploit an IMC Emulator (IMCE) with multiple
Processing Units (PUs) for investigating how the deployment of a CNN model in a
multi-processing system affects its performance, in terms of processing rate
and latency. For that purpose, we introduce the Load-Balance-Longest-Path
(LBLP) algorithm, that dynamically assigns all CNN nodes to the available IMCE
PUs, for maximizing the processing rate and minimizing latency due to efficient
resources utilization. We are benchmarking LBLP against other alternative
scheduling strategies for a number of CNN models and experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### [10] [RAS: A Bit-Exact rANS Accelerator For High-Performance Neural Lossless Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04684)
*Yuchao Qin,Anjunyi Fan,Bonan Yan*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAS, a hardware architecture that accelerates rANS-based lossless compression, making it faster while maintaining high compression ratios with probabilistic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lossless compression in data centers is essential for handling vast data efficiently. However, current probabilistic models are computationally slow, necessitating faster compression systems.

Method: The authors developed RAS, integrating rANS into a hardware pipeline using innovative techniques such as BF16 format for distribution storage, a two-stage rANS update to reduce logic costs, and prediction-guided decoding for faster operations.

Result: RAS exhibited remarkable performance, achieving 121.2x encoding and 70.9x decoding speedups compared to Python rANS, and reduced average binary-search steps by 55%. When combined with neural probability models, it exceeded classical codecs and CPU/GPU implementations in compression ratio.

Conclusion: RAS provides a practical solution for fast and efficient neural lossless compression with significant speed and compression improvements, addressing computational bottlenecks in current methods.

Abstract: Data centers handle vast volumes of data that require efficient lossless
compression, yet emerging probabilistic models based methods are often
computationally slow. To address this, we introduce RAS, the Range Asymmetric
Numeral System Acceleration System, a hardware architecture that integrates the
rANS algorithm into a lossless compression pipeline and eliminates key
bottlenecks. RAS couples an rANS core with a probabilistic generator, storing
distributions in BF16 format and converting them once into a fixed-point domain
shared by a unified division/modulo datapath. A two-stage rANS update with
byte-level re-normalization reduces logic cost and memory traffic, while a
prediction-guided decoding path speculatively narrows the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) search window and safely falls back to maintain
bit-exactness. A multi-lane organization scales throughput and enables
fine-grained clock gating for efficient scheduling. On image workloads, our
RTL-simulated prototype achieves 121.2x encode and 70.9x decode speedups over a
Python rANS baseline, reducing average decoder binary-search steps from 7.00 to
3.15 (approximately 55% fewer). When paired with neural probability models, RAS
sustains higher compression ratios than classical codecs and outperforms
CPU/GPU rANS implementations, offering a practical approach to fast neural
lossless compression.

### [11] [Eliminating the Hidden Cost of Zone Management in ZNS SSDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04687)
*Teona Bagashvili,Tarikul Islam Papon,Subhadeep Sarkar,Manos Athanassoulis*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes SilentZNS, an improved zone allocation and management approach for ZNS SSDs to reduce device-level write amplification, minimize wear, and enhance workload execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ZNS SSDs provide stable storage throughput but face challenges such as device-level write amplification, increased wear, and I/O interference due to rigid zone mapping and management.

Method: The authors propose SilentZNS, a flexible zone management approach that dynamically allocates resources to zones. It eliminates fixed physical zones, uses selective blocks to reduce unnecessary writes, and ensures wear leveling and high performance.

Result: Using a ConfZNS++ emulator, SilentZNS reduces dummy writes by up to 20x, reduces DLWA by 86% at 10% zone occupancy, minimizes wear by up to 76.9%, and accelerates workload execution by up to 3.7x.

Conclusion: SilentZNS resolves limitations of current ZNS SSD implementations by dynamically adapting zones, leading to significant improvements in write amplification, wear reduction, and execution speed.

Abstract: Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs offer a promising interface for stable throughput
and low-latency storage by eliminating device-side garbage collection. They
expose storage as append-only zones that give the host applications direct
control over data placement. However, current ZNS implementations suffer from
(a) device-level write amplification (DLWA), (b) increased wear, and (c)
interference with host I/O due to zone mapping and management. We identify two
primary design decisions as the main cause: (i) fixed physical zones and (ii)
full-zone operations that lead to excessive physical writes. We propose
SilentZNS, a new zone mapping and management approach that addresses the
aforementioned limitations by on-the-fly allocating available resources to
zones, while minimizing wear, maintaining parallelism, and avoiding unnecessary
writes at the device-level. SilentZNS is a flexible zone allocation scheme that
departs from the traditional logical-to-physical zone mapping and allows for
arbitrary collections of blocks to be assigned to a zone. We add the necessary
constraints to ensure wear-leveling and state-of-the-art read performance, and
use only the required blocks to avoid dummy writes during zone reset. We
implement SilentZNS using the state-of-the-art ConfZNS++ emulator and show that
it eliminates the undue burden of dummy writes by up to 20x, leading to lower
DLWA (86% less at 10% zone occupancy), less overall wear (up to 76.9%), and up
to 3.7x faster workload execution.

### [12] [SMART-WRITE: Adaptive Learning-based Write Energy Optimization for Phase Change Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04713)
*Mahek Desai,Rowena Quinn,Marjan Asadinia*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMART-WRITE, a hybrid neural network and reinforcement learning strategy to tackle the limitations of phase-change memory (PCM), specifically in lifespan and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability limits of traditional memory technologies like DRAM and to provide solutions for the major drawbacks of PCM—its limited lifespan and high energy consumption during write operations.

Method: The authors developed SMART-WRITE, combining neural networks (NN) to monitor real-time conditions and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically optimize write parameters, reducing energy consumption and enhancing durability.

Result: SMART-WRITE reduces write energy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared to baseline and previous models.

Conclusion: SMART-WRITE demonstrates significant potential to overcome PCM's limitations, making it a more viable alternative to existing memory technologies for scalable, energy-efficient data storage.

Abstract: As dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and other current transistor-based
memories approach their scalability limits, the search for alternative storage
methods becomes increasingly urgent. Phase-change memory (PCM) emerges as a
promising candidate due to its scalability, fast access time, and zero leakage
power compared to many existing memory technologies. However, PCM has
significant drawbacks that currently hinder its viability as a replacement. PCM
cells suffer from a limited lifespan because write operations degrade the
physical material, and these operations consume a considerable amount of
energy. For PCM to be a practical option for data storage-which involves
frequent write operations-its cell endurance must be enhanced, and write energy
must be reduced. In this paper, we propose SMART-WRITE, a method that
integrates neural networks (NN) and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically
optimize write energy and improve performance. The NN model monitors real-time
operating conditions and device characteristics to determine optimal write
parameters, while the RL model dynamically adjusts these parameters to further
optimize PCM's energy consumption. By continuously adjusting PCM write
parameters based on real-time system conditions, SMART-WRITE reduces write
energy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared
to the baseline and previous models.

### [13] [MDM: Manhattan Distance Mapping of DNN Weights for Parasitic-Resistance-Resilient Memristive Crossbars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04798)
*Matheus Farias,Wanghley Martins,H. T. Kung*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM), a technique to reduce parasitic resistance effects in memristive compute-in-memory crossbars, improving efficiency and performance for deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency caused by parasitic resistance (PR) in memristive compute-in-memory crossbars, which limits their scalability and overall performance in deep neural network processing.

Method: MDM rearranges memristor placements by exploiting bit-level sparsity, aligning active cells closer to regions with less parasitic resistance based on the Manhattan distance. This reduces distortion effects in the crossbars.

Result: MDM achieves up to a 46% reduction in parasitic resistance nonideality factors and improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% across DNN models, including ResNets.

Conclusion: MDM offers a lightweight, effective solution for optimizing memristive crossbars in DNN accelerators, improving efficiency, reducing nonidealities, and boosting performance.

Abstract: Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM) is a post-training deep neural network (DNN)
weight mapping technique for memristive bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM)
crossbars that reduces parasitic resistance (PR) nonidealities.
  PR limits crossbar efficiency by mapping DNN matrices into small crossbar
tiles, reducing CIM-based speedup. Each crossbar executes one tile, requiring
digital synchronization before the next layer. At this granularity, designers
either deploy many small crossbars in parallel or reuse a few sequentially-both
increasing analog-to-digital conversions, latency, I/O pressure, and chip area.
  MDM alleviates PR effects by optimizing active-memristor placement.
Exploiting bit-level structured sparsity, it feeds activations from the denser
low-order side and reorders rows according to the Manhattan distance,
relocating active cells toward regions less affected by PR and thus lowering
the nonideality factor (NF).
  Applied to DNN models on ImageNet-1k, MDM reduces NF by up to 46% and
improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% in ResNets.
Overall, it provides a lightweight, spatially informed method for scaling CIM
DNN accelerators.

### [14] [MultiVic: A Time-Predictable RISC-V Multi-Core Processor Optimized for Neural Network Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05321)
*Maximilian Kirschner,Konstantin Dudzik,Ben Krusekamp,Jürgen Becker*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of predictable timing behavior in real-time systems adopting neural networks and proposes a multi-core vector processor with static scheduling for improved performance and predictability in such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of neural networks in real-time systems like automated driving requires hardware with both high performance and predictable timing, which is lacking in current technology due to limited resources or memory interference.

Method: A novel hardware architecture is introduced featuring a multi-core vector processor with predictable cores and local scratchpad memories. A central management core implements a static schedule to manage access to shared external memory.

Result: Evaluations of different design configurations show that architectures with more smaller cores achieve better performance and higher clock frequencies, while maintaining low execution time fluctuation, crucial for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully bridges performance and predictability trade-offs, offering a strong solution for real-time systems with neural network workloads.

Abstract: Real-time systems, particularly those used in domains like automated driving,
are increasingly adopting neural networks. From this trend arises the need for
high-performance hardware exhibiting predictable timing behavior. While
state-of-the-art real-time hardware often suffers from limited memory and
compute resources, modern AI accelerators typically lack the crucial
predictability due to memory interference.
  We present a new hardware architecture to bridge this gap between performance
and predictability. The architecture features a multi-core vector processor
with predictable cores, each equipped with local scratchpad memories. A central
management core orchestrates access to shared external memory following a
statically determined schedule.
  To evaluate the proposed hardware architecture, we analyze different variants
of our parameterized design. We compare these variants to a baseline
architecture consisting of a single-core vector processor with large vector
registers. We find that configurations with a larger number of smaller cores
achieve better performance due to increased effective memory bandwidth and
higher clock frequencies. Crucially for real-time systems, execution time
fluctuation remains very low, demonstrating the platform's time predictability.

### [15] [Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning Over Ordered Procedural Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04688)
*Adrita Anika,Md Messal Monem Miah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in reconstructing ordered procedural sequences from shuffled steps using a dataset of food recipes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and reconstructing procedural sequences is vital for LLMs, especially when step order directly impacts outcomes.

Method: The authors assess LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, using food recipes and metrics like Kendall's Tau, NLCS, and NED to evaluate sequence ordering quality.

Result: Model performance decreases with longer sequences and more shuffled inputs, highlighting challenges in processing complex procedures.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit limitations in procedural reasoning, particularly for longer and more disordered sequence inputs.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

### [16] [Adaptive Testing for LLM Evaluation: A Psychometric Alternative to Static Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04689)
*Peiyu Li,Xiuxiu Tang,Si Chen,Ying Cheng,Ronald Metoyer,Ting Hua,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive evaluation method for language models called ATLAS, drastically reducing the number of items needed while preserving precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of large language models is costly and inefficient using traditional methods due to the numerous benchmark items and inconsistencies in their quality and informativeness.

Method: ATLAS utilizes Item Response Theory (IRT) with Fisher information-guided item selection to estimate model ability adaptively.

Result: The method reduces benchmark items by up to 90% while maintaining high precision. It also uncovers annotation errors affecting static evaluations and demonstrates rank differences when compared to standard accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: ATLAS offers a more efficient, precise, and adaptive framework for evaluating large language models, addressing issues in traditional static benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at
https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/ATLAS.git.

### [17] [SARC: Sentiment-Augmented Deep Role Clustering for Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04692)
*Jingqing Wang,Jiaxing Shang,Rong Xu,Fei Hao,Tianjin Huang,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework called SARC for fake news detection using sentiment-augmented role clustering to better identify user roles based on sentiment and improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fake news detection often underutilize sentiment analysis and fail to differentiate user roles, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The SARC framework employs BiGRU with attention mechanisms to encode comments and sentiments. It integrates a deep clustering module to classify user roles and optimizes jointly for role clustering and fake news detection.

Result: SARC outperforms baseline models in identifying fake news, showing superior performance on RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating sentiment and user role differentiation significantly enhances fake news detection, and the SARC framework sets new benchmarks in model performance.

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

### [18] [Reasoning Up the Instruction Ladder for Controllable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04694)
*Zishuo Zheng,Vidhisha Balachandran,Chan Young Park,Faeze Brahman,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enforcing instruction hierarchy (IH) in large language models (LLMs) to enhance their reliability and controllability when reconciling competing directives. They introduce the VerIH dataset and train models with reinforcement learning to improve reasoning over instruction prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs being used in high-stakes decision-making, managing and prioritizing conflicting instructions from various sources is critical for ensuring their reliability, controllability, and safety.

Method: The authors conceptualized instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. They created VerIH, a dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers, and used lightweight reinforcement learning to train models for reasoning and instruction prioritization.

Result: The proposed training method using VerIH improved the models' instruction-following capabilities, ensured consistent performance on benchmarks, and enhanced robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning over instruction hierarchies is an effective approach to creating reliable and robust LLMs. This method allows controllable updates to system instructions and improves the safety and adaptability of LLMs in critical scenarios.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

further examine the effects of reranking, observing only marginal performance
improvements accompanied by higher response latency.

*K M Sajjadul Islam,John Fields,Praveen Madiraju*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model for detecting six mental health conditions from social media text, achieving high predictive accuracy and explainability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to enable early detection of mental health disorders from social media text for timely interventions and support.

Method: The authors developed multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer model, and used curated datasets to conduct multiclass classification experiments for detecting specific mental health conditions. They also applied explainability techniques to ensure reliable distinctions between categories.

Result: multiMentalRoBERTa achieved superior performance with macro F1-scores of 0.839 (six-class setup) and 0.870 (five-class setup excluding stress), outperforming other models like MentalBERT.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned transformers can effectively and reliably detect mental health conditions in sensitive contexts, and multiMentalRoBERTa offers a lightweight and deployable solution for improving mental health support systems.

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

### [22] [Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: Winnowing Down Divergent Views in Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04700)
*Song Wang,Zihan Chen,Peng Wang,Zhepei Wei,Zhen Tan,Yu Meng,Cong Shen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WinnowRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework aimed at improving document filtering for generating more accurate responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of retrieval-augmented generation, where increasing the number of retrieved documents can introduce noise and reduce output quality.

Method: WinnowRAG uses a two-stage approach: query-aware clustering to group documents into topic clusters, and winnowing, where a critic LLM evaluates and filters noisy agent outputs while retaining valuable information. No fine-tuning of existing models is required.

Result: WinnowRAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in experiments on various realistic datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances response accuracy by systematically filtering irrelevant documents, and it is adaptable to diverse applications due to its model-agnostic design.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does
not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.
Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Preetum Nakkiran,Arwen Bradley,Adam Goliński,Eugene Ndiaye,Michael Kirchhof,Sinead Williamson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates if Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide meaningful confidence estimates for their answers and identifies mechanisms why this capability emerges naturally in certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address whether LLMs, which excel at generating coherent responses at token level, can accurately assess their confidence in delivering semantically meaningful answers.

Method: The researchers propose the notion of 'semantic calibration,' use theoretical frameworks such as 'B-calibration,' and conduct experiments on open-domain question-answering tasks to assess LLMs' confidence predictions and their disruption by additional tuning methods.

Result: The study finds that base LLMs exhibit remarkable semantic calibration by default but modifications like reinforcement learning or chain-of-thought reasoning can disrupt this trait.

Conclusion: Base LLMs inherently exhibit semantic calibration due to next-token prediction mechanisms. However, specific training methods may hinder this capability, suggesting trade-offs between performance improvement and calibration accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

Motivation: To enhance reliability in evaluating the safety and robustness of large language models (LLMs) by addressing validity issues in LLM benchmarks.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading NLP and machine learning conferences using 29 expert reviewers to assess patterns and weaknesses in evaluation frameworks.

Result: Found recurring validity issues in phenomena measurement, tasks, and scoring metrics used in LLM benchmarks, which challenge the reliability of claims made about LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper underscores validity concerns in LLM evaluation benchmarks and provides eight actionable recommendations for improving future benchmark development in LLM research.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their
capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment.
Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and
'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that
represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers,
we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences
in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed
articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and
scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To
address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed
actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust and specialized framework for assessing LLMs in real-world governmental scenarios, focusing on bilingual policy tasks.

Method: Three advancements were introduced: building an up-to-date bilingual policy corpus, developing scenario-grounded tasks, and constructing a dual-metric evaluation framework for precise performance measurement.

Result: Evaluation across 10 LLMs demonstrated a hierarchy of performance with reasoning models excelling. Fine-tuning an open-source model with POLIS-Bench achieved competitive results against proprietary baselines, demonstrating cost-efficiency and task competence.

Conclusion: POLIS-Bench enables comprehensive evaluation and supports the development of cost-effective LLMs for real-world governmental applications in bilingual policy contexts.

Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite
designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios.
Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major
advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive,
up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment
sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii)
Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded
tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the
Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and
application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel
dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy
rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement
adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on
POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models
maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the
difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we
successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS
series models achieves parity with, or surpasses, strong proprietary baselines
on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a
cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental
deployment.

Conclusion: Competitive programming benchmarks are crucial for assessing language models in underrepresented languages. This work encourages further research in multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource

widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural
language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of
performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of
solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time
and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work
demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating

### [28] [First is Not Really Better Than Last: Evaluating Layer Choice and Aggregation Strategies in Language Model Data Influence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04715)
*Dmytro Vitel,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges existing beliefs about the most suitable layers for influence score computations in Large Language Models (LLMs), arguing middle attention layers are better than embedding layers and introducing novel methods for influence score aggregation and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effectively interpreting LLM decisions and auditing large-scale datasets by improving training sample influence estimation methods.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to challenge existing hypotheses, proposes alternate aggregation techniques for influence scores, and introduces a new metric called Noise Detection Rate (NDR) for evaluating influence efficacy.

Result: Middle attention layers were found to outperform embedding layers for influence estimation. Alternatives to average-based aggregation yielded improved performance, and the Noise Detection Rate showed strong predictive capability without requiring model retraining.

Conclusion: The paper overturns prior assumptions about layer relevance, improves influence computation strategies through aggregation techniques and a new metric, and enhances model auditing effectively.

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

*Ha Young Kim,Jun Li,Ana Beatriz Solana,Carolin M. Pirkl,Benedikt Wiestler,Julia A. Schnabel,Cosmin I. Bercea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RADAR, a retrieval-augmented system designed to improve rare disease recognition in medical imaging using sentence embedding and external clinical knowledge for more effective diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of AI models failing to detect rare diseases due to insufficient training data, which mimics the process radiologists use by consulting literature and cases for unfamiliar diseases.

Method: It proposes RADAR, which uses sentence transformers and FAISS indexing for similarity searches in medical literature to guide diagnosis without requiring additional training, integrating it with large language models for improved pathology recognition.

Result: The RADAR system achieves a performance improvement of up to 10.2% for rare disease recognition in brain MRI, especially benefiting open-source models like DeepSeek.

Conclusion: RADAR demonstrates how retrieval-augmented methods can boost accuracy and interpretability in rare disease diagnostics, offering a promising approach for medical imaging challenges.

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence
conditions in medical imaging.

### [30] [Surprisal reveals diversity gaps in image captioning and different scorers change the story](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04754)
*Nikolai Ilinykh,Simon Dobnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a metric, surprisal variance, to quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning by examining token-level probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust diversity metrics for evaluating image captions generated by models compared to human captions.

Method: The surprisal variance is calculated using a caption-trained n-gram language model to measure token-level probabilities within caption sets.

Result: Human captions exhibited twice the surprisal variance of models when measured with a caption-trained scorer, but models showed higher surprisal variance when evaluated with a general-language scorer.

Conclusion: A single scorer can drastically alter conclusions about diversity, so robust evaluation requires using multiple scoring measures.

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report
surprisal under several scorers.

*Chenxi Liu,Junjie Liang,Yuqi Jia,Bochuan Cao,Yang Bai,Heng Huang,Xun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERPO, a framework to improve reinforcement learning in LLMs by reactivating training signals in residual prompts, leading to better performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of residual prompts, which lose their training signals as models train longer and scale larger, reducing diversity and training effectiveness.

Method: The ERPO framework tracks each residual prompt's history and increases sampling temperature to encourage diverse outputs, reactivating training signals for prompts that previously produced only correct responses.

Result: ERPO outperforms baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, showcasing its efficacy in enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Conclusion: ERPO is an effective solution to revive training signals from residual prompts, improving the diversity and reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

### [32] [Minimal and Mechanistic Conditions for Behavioral Self-Awareness in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04875)
*Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Shubkarman Singh,Bart Bussmann,Patrick Leask*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the emergence of behavioral self-awareness in instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying it as domain-specific and controllable through minimal modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the emergence of behavioral self-awareness in LLMs and its implications, such as safety concerns during evaluations where models may disguise their true abilities.

Method: Controlled finetuning experiments were conducted on instruction-tuned LLMs using low-rank adapters (LoRA), specifically rank-1 LoRA adapters, to analyze and induce self-aware behavior.

Result: Findings revealed that (1) self-awareness can be reliably induced using minimal adjustments (a single rank-1 LoRA adapter), (2) the behavior is largely governed by a single steering vector in activation space, and (3) self-awareness is task-specific and localized across domains.

Conclusion: Behavioral self-awareness in LLMs is a domain-specific feature, linear in nature, which can be effectively induced and modulated using minimal interventions.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

*Jaehoon Lee,Sohyun Kim,Wanggeun Park,Geon Lee,Seungkyung Kim,Minyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDS KoPub VDR, a novel benchmark for retrieval and analysis of complex Korean public documents, aiming to bridge gaps in multilingual and multimodal visual document retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks neglect non-English languages and the structural intricacies of official documents, creating a need for a resource tailored towards Korean public documents.

Method: The authors created a benchmark consisting of 361 real-world Korean documents (40,781 pages) and constructed 600 query-page-answer triples refined through human verification. Tasks are categorized into text-based and multimodal retrieval.

Result: The benchmark reveals significant performance gaps in multimodal retrieval requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for advanced AI models.

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR serves as a vital benchmark for enhancing multimodal AI capabilities in handling complex public documents across text and visual modalities.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

*Chandra Vamsi Krishna Alla,Harish Naidu Gaddam,Manohar Kommi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BudgetMem is a memory-augmented architecture that selectively chooses information to remember, achieving significant cost and memory savings while processing long documents effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory constraints of Large Language Models when processing long contexts.

Method: BudgetMem combines selective memory policies with feature-based salience scoring and sparse retrieval techniques (BM25) to efficiently store and access relevant information.

Result: BudgetMem shows remarkable performance on long documents, reducing memory usage by 72.4% with only 1.0% F1 score degradation compared to traditional retrieval-based methods.

Conclusion: BudgetMem offers a practical and efficient solution for deploying long-context language models on resource-constrained hardware, facilitating wider accessibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

*Yu Li,Lehui Li,Qingmin Liao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework utilizing large language models to more effectively recommend datasets and baselines by leveraging collective perception in citation networks, outperforming previous methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve dataset and baseline recommendations, addressing issues in prior efforts such as limited data coverage and overreliance on content similarity.

Method: The authors developed a framework involving automated data collection, representation enhancement using citation networks, finetuned embedding models for recall, and a reasoning-augmented reranker using LLMs.

Result: The curated dataset achieves 85% coverage of datasets/baselines at top AI conferences over the past five years, with proposed methods improving recommendation metrics significantly (e.g., +8.30% in HitRate@5).

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances reliable, interpretable automations of experimental design, demonstrating meaningful improvements in baseline/dataset recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable
automation of experimental design.

*Shixiong Zhao,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses taxonomic inconsistencies in Wikidata by proposing a validation method and system for correcting classification errors and optimizing knowledge graph relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata's openness and size make it essential for knowledge graph research, but its loose editorial policy introduces taxonomic inconsistencies.

Method: A novel validation method identifies classification errors, over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in Wikidata. A system enables user inspection of taxonomic relationships.

Result: The method successfully identifies taxonomic issues and introduces a user-driven system to evaluate and correct them efficiently.

Conclusion: Leveraging crowdsourcing, the study improves Wikidata's taxonomic consistency, making it more reliable for global knowledge access and research.

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

*Wei Shao,Lingchao Zheng,Pengyu Wang,Peizhen Zheng,Jun Li,Yuwei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoPT, a framework improving tokenization speed for long contexts in large language models, ensuring consistent and lossless results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backlogs in computational latency in long-context inference scenarios due to tokenization bottlenecks.

Method: LoPT uses character-position matching and dynamic chunk adjustment for parallel tokenization without boundary artifacts.

Result: Empirical findings show LoPT achieves high-speed tokenization while maintaining consistency across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: LoPT enhances tokenization efficiency and reliability, addressing an overlooked bottleneck in long-context inference scenarios.

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in accurately simulating morally ambiguous or villainous characters, highlighting how safety alignment hampers their ability to authentically portray such personas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conflict between safety alignment in LLMs and their ability to effectively role-play morally ambiguous or antagonistic characters.

Method: The authors introduced the Moral RolePlay benchmark, which includes a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set. They conducted large-scale evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs simulating characters with varying moralities.

Result: Evaluations revealed a decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. LLMs particularly struggle with antagonistic traits, such as deceitfulness and manipulation, often replacing nuanced villainous traits with superficial aggression.

Conclusion: The research highlights the conflict between model safety principles and creative role-playing fidelity, proposing that further development in nuanced, context-aware alignment methods is required.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

*Ya Wang,Guangzheng Zhu,Cungen Cao,Jingjing Li,He Li,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to extract common emotional events in Chinese using a large language model and filtering techniques, resulting in a high-quality dataset with sentiment polarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for accessible knowledge about emotional events, particularly common context-independent ones, is growing as they play a vital role in enhancing applications' effectiveness.

Method: The paper collects emotional event indicators, uses a Chinese LLM to generate emotional events, trains a filter to validate results, and classifies them into positive and negative categories.

Result: By implementing this approach, the authors harvested 102,218 high-quality emotional events with sentiment labels, building a unique large-scale knowledge base.

Conclusion: The proposed method proves effective for acquiring commonsense emotional events in Chinese. The dataset also shows potential for emotion cause extraction applications.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PBSUITE, a tool to evaluate how well large language models (LLMs) align with diverse user values and needs, especially in interactive conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often need to adapt to varied corporate policies, regulations, and ethical standards, and current alignment methods struggle to address these pluralistic requirements.

Method: They created PBSUITE, which includes a dataset of realistic LLM behavioral policies across industries and a dynamic framework for testing model compliance under adversarial conditions.

Result: They found that LLMs perform well in single-turn interactions (failure rates under 4%) but struggle significantly in multi-turn adversarial conversations (failure rates up to 84%).

Conclusion: Current alignment methods are inadequate for pluralistic contexts, and PBSUITE provides the foundation to develop better alignment techniques for diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

TL;DR: This paper investigates shared context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) using Order-Level Attention (OLA) and introduces a new method for cross-LM knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore commonalities in context aggregation patterns across different LMs, which remain a largely unexamined area, to deepen understanding of LMs and enable cross-model knowledge transfer.

Method: The paper introduces Order-Level Attention (OLA), derived from Attention Rollout decomposition, to identify similarities across LMs. It proposes a Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA) for cross-LM adapter transfer using OLA as a unified syntactic feature.

Result: TOA demonstrates effective cross-LM generalization, enhancing the performance of unseen Language Models without needing parameter updates.

Conclusion: Context aggregation patterns across LMs share commonalities, and leveraging OLA enables training-free cross-model knowledge transfer that improves unseen LM functionality.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a claim normalization method for multilingual misinformation detection using systematic post decomposition and fine-tuned models. The methodology obtains robust cross-lingual generalization and improved performance metrics across 20 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of detecting and normalizing misinformation spread on social media across multiple languages, leveraging clear semantic alignment and cross-lingual transfer techniques.

Method: The paper employs systematic decomposition of social media posts using WH questions, fine-tunes Qwen3-14B using LoRA, applies token-level semantic filtering, and utilizes retrieval-augmented few-shot learning during inference.

Result: The proposed system achieves competitive METEOR scores across multiple languages and outperforms baseline methods significantly, demonstrating strong cross-lingual generalization and semantic coherence.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves multilingual misinformation detection and normalizes claims across linguistic structures, achieving robust semantic alignment and significant performance gains.

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection -
transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across
20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of
posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust
cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our
methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided
dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for
semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual
examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16
(English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard
and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative
improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over
existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization
for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across
diverse linguistic structures.

Motivation: The growing demand for plain-language biomedical text simplification calls for scalable solutions, given public health-seeking behavior and increasing consumption of technical biomedical information.

Method: The authors conducted empirical analysis comparing the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B using metrics like SARI, BERTScore, readability indices, and distributional measures.

Result: Mistral 24B was identified as superior for text simplification, achieving better readability (SARI mean 42.46) and human-like discourse fidelity (BERTScore 0.91), compared to QWen2.5 32B (BERTScore 0.89). Correlation among indices found redundancies and highlighted lexical support issues.

Conclusion: The instruction-tuned Mistral 24B demonstrates readiness for biomedical text simplification tasks, provides insights for metric selection, and highlights lexical domain adaptation as a primary challenge.

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

### [44] [Iterative Layer-wise Distillation for Efficient Compression of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05085)
*Grigory Kovalev,Mikhail Tikhomirov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for distilling large language models to create compact versions with minimal performance loss using iterative evaluation of layer importance and advanced training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop smaller, efficient language models suitable for deployment in resource-limited environments while preserving high performance.

Method: The improved method uses iterative evaluation of layer importance, coupled with a joint training loss incorporating KL divergence and mean squared error. Layer importance is assessed using performance measures after layer removal.

Result: Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model reduced the layers from 36 to 28 (2.47 billion parameters) with 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. Middle layers were found less impactful.

Conclusion: Iterative distillation and fine-tuning effectively reduce model size with controlled performance degradation, making it practical for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

*Daniel Grießhaber,Maximilian Kimmich,Johannes Maucher,Ngoc Thang Vu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhancements to evolutionary prompt optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs), offering better efficiency, control, and evaluation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evolutionary prompt optimization are limited by inadequate operators and inefficient evaluation processes. This paper aims to improve the process for greater efficiency and robustness.

Method: The authors propose decomposing the evolution process into distinct steps, using LLM-based verification, incorporating human feedback to refine operators, and employing better evaluation strategies that reduce computational costs.

Result: The enhancements lead to improved optimization outcomes and reduced computational demands in prompt optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements significantly advance the field of evolutionary prompt optimization. The released code facilitates easier application and further experimentation in this area.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

*Robin Armingaud,Romaric Besançon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManufactuBERT, a RoBERTa model pretrained on manufacturing-specific data, achieves state-of-the-art in manufacturing-related NLP tasks with reduced training time and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose Transformer models underperform in specialized domains like manufacturing due to lack of domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Developed ManufactuBERT using continual pretraining on a manufacturing-specific corpus, leveraging a multi-stage deduplication and domain-filtering data pipeline.

Result: ManufactuBERT surpassed specialized baselines in manufacturing NLP tasks and demonstrated faster convergence, reducing training time by 33%.

Conclusion: ManufactuBERT validates the importance of domain-specific corpora and deduplication for enhancing performance in specialized domains, providing a replicable approach for other domains.

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at
https://huggingface.co/cea-list-ia.

### [47] [Mind the Gap... or Not? How Translation Errors and Evaluation Details Skew Multilingual Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05162)
*Jan-Thorsten Peter,David Vilar,Tobias Domhan,Dan Malkin,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper initially finds performance gaps in multilingual large language models (LLMs) across different languages, including both high- and low-resource ones, in the math domain. However, upon discovering translation errors and output extraction inconsistencies in existing datasets, the study corrects these issues and finds the performance gap mostly disappears.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore cross-lingual performance of large language models in the math domain and to address inconsistencies and potential flaws in existing evaluation datasets that could skew insights about language performance gaps.

Method: The authors analyze a standard multilingual math benchmark (MGSM) and identify translation errors and inconsistencies in answer extraction from LLM outputs. They propose an automated quality assurance method to clean the dataset and offer additional recommendations for standardized answer extraction.

Result: Results show that after addressing translation inaccuracies and standardizing output extraction, the initially observed performance gap across languages nearly vanishes. They also release a corrected dataset to the research community.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that perceived performance gaps across languages in LLMs are often an artifact of flawed datasets rather than inherent model limitations. The study emphasizes the importance of dataset quality and standardized evaluation methods.

Abstract: Most current large language models (LLMs) support a wide variety of languages
in addition to English, including high-resource languages (e.g. German,
Chinese, French), as well as low-resource ones (e.g. Swahili, Telugu). In
addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains,
like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example
domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages.
Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap
in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat
against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages.
We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual
capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact
that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math
benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in
the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM
outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic
quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations
to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the
aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different
conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to
the community.

### [48] [Effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought in Distilling Reasoning Capability from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05184)
*Cong-Thanh Do,Rama Doddipatla,Kate Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves knowledge distillation from large language models to smaller ones, enhancing reasoning capabilities in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to enhance smaller language models' natural language reasoning and understanding abilities by leveraging CoT prompting in knowledge distillation.

Method: Conduct white-box knowledge distillation experiments using CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset and evaluate performance with benchmarks like BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH).

Result: CoT prompting improves the effectiveness of white-box knowledge distillation, enabling smaller distilled models to perform better in reasoning and understanding tasks.

Conclusion: CoT prompting is crucial in transferring reasoning capabilities from larger LLMs to smaller ones, showing promising results for complex language tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

### [49] [Translation via Annotation: A Computational Study of Translating Classical Chinese into Japanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05239)
*Zilong Li,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary tasks to address the low-resource challenge of translating classical Chinese into Japanese through annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the low-resource issue in annotating and translating classical Chinese into Japanese, a process traditionally performed with annotations around each character.

Method: The authors introduce an LLM-based annotation pipeline and build a dataset from open-source digital translation data. They incorporate auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks to improve training for sequence tagging.

Result: The study shows that auxiliary tasks enhance performance in sequence tagging under low-resource conditions. While LLMs excel in direct translation, they struggle with annotation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method complements LLMs by improving their annotation capability, offering solutions for low-resource sequence tagging challenges.

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

### [50] [Reflective Personalization Optimization: A Post-hoc Rewriting Framework for Black-Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05286)
*Teqi Hao,Xioayu Tan,Shaojie Shi,Yinghui Xu,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a framework for better personalizing large language models by separating content generation from user-style alignment, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of context injection methods in personalizing black-box LLMs, which struggle with balancing accurate content generation and aligning with user-specific styles.

Method: RPO operates in two stages: a base model first generates generic quality content, followed by a reflection module explicitly rewriting the output to match user preferences. The reflection module is trained using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that RPO significantly outperforms existing personalization methods, validating the decoupled approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: RPO offers an innovative, efficient, and model-agnostic solution for personalizing large language models, surpassing current methods and presenting a novel pathway for user-centric text generation.

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

*Shreya Gupta,Ojasva Saxena,Arghodeep Nandi,Sarah Masud,Kiran Garimella,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on podcast narrative analysis, presenting a fine-tuned BERT model to better capture narrative frames and their links to entities for more effective automated analysis compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Podcasts influence public opinion significantly, but their unscripted and conversational nature makes it difficult for current automated tools to analyze their narratives effectively.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a BERT model to explicitly connect narrative frames to specific entities within podcasts, using granular frame labels linked to topics for a deeper study of discourse trends.

Result: The fine-tuned model offers a novel frame-labeling methodology aligning better with human judgment and reveals the relationship between podcast topics and the narrative frames applied.

Conclusion: This approach enhances understanding of podcast discourse and offers a more reliable framework for analyzing digital media influence.

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Innovative methods using advanced regular expressions and large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract detailed descriptions of criminal behavior from Slovakian court verdicts, demonstrating high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing criminal justice data by extracting more detailed information from court verdicts, aiming to address limitations in administrative data descriptions of offenses.

Method: The authors applied two extraction approaches: advanced regular expressions focusing on normalization of text patterns, and Gemini Flash 2.0 LLM prompted with predefined instructions. They also evaluated a combined approach.

Result: Advanced regular expressions achieved 97%, LLMs achieved 98.75%, and their combination reached 99.5% in identifying descriptions. Both advanced methods matched human annotations in approximately 90% of evaluations.

Conclusion: The integration of advanced regular expressions and LLMs significantly improves the extraction of offense descriptions from court decisions, achieving high accuracy and close alignment with human annotations.

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

*Firoj Ahmmed Patwary,Abdullah Al Noman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BengaliBPE, a BPE tokenizer explicitly designed for Bengali, addressing linguistic limitations of current subword tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subword tokenizers don’t perform well for morphologically rich languages like Bengali.

Method: BengaliBPE incorporates Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware rules to retain linguistic consistency.

Result: BengaliBPE demonstrated improved segmentation detail and morphological interpretability in evaluation compared to existing tokenizers.

Conclusion: Language-specific tokenization, like BengaliBPE, is crucial for better NLP performance in morphologically rich scripts.

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual
language models.

### [54] [A multimodal multiplex of the mental lexicon for multilingual individuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05361)
*Maria Huynh,Wilder C. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how the mental lexicon in multilingual individuals functions, particularly focusing on visual inputs' influence on language acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of the mental lexicon in multilinguals and how heritage languages influence additional language learning.

Method: Building on established frameworks like BIA+ and multiplex network models, the study incorporates multimodal experimental design by linking visual inputs to lexical representations.

Result: The study proposes a novel layer to the mental lexicon model, examining how visual inputs impact language proficiency and accuracy in translation tasks.

Conclusion: This research emphasizes the potential role of multimodal inputs in enhancing language acquisition and accuracy, suggesting important implications for studying multilingual cognition.

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive
load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over
the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies
have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word
recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel
activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll
et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals
who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in
various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language
Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of
the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak
multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who
investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental
lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by
Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer
network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design
extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex
model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their
corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the
mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language
influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the
presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants'
proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address traditional security mechanisms' limitations against growing cyber threats and leverage LLMs for improved cybersecurity intelligence and transparency.

Method: The system employs a combination of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models, generating knowledge graphs to elucidate and explain model reasoning.

Result: Experimental evaluation using two datasets and seven LLMs demonstrated that responses matched reference answers over 91% of the time for the best configurations.

Conclusion: RAGRecon enhances cybersecurity by effectively using LLMs with RAG for threat intelligence and promotes transparency through explainable AI, proven by high response accuracy.

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity, traditional security
mechanisms struggle to keep up. Large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text
processing and generation. This paper explores the use of LLMs with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining
real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system,
RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats.
Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by
generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every
reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of
the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the
system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon
experimentally with two datasets and seven different LLMs and the responses
matched the reference responses more than 91% of the time for the best
combinations.

### [56] [Minority-Aware Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue Systems via Preference-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05407)
*Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework is proposed for improving user satisfaction estimation in dialogue systems by focusing on both individual and group-level preferences, addressing limitations of one-size-fits-all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing dialogue system models that overlook minority perspectives and fail to adapt to individual user preferences.

Method: The framework introduces three key approaches: CoPeR for capturing individual preferences, the M2PC algorithm for unsupervised discovery of user groups, and PAda-PPO for optimizing alignment with individual and group preferences using reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset show improved user satisfaction prediction, especially for underrepresented user groups.

Conclusion: The new framework provides a more inclusive and personalized user satisfaction estimation method, ensuring better representation of both majority and minority user groups.

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

### [57] [Steering Language Models with Weight Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05408)
*Constanza Fierro,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces contrastive weight steering, a method that modifies model weights through weight arithmetic to address undesired behaviors like sycophancy, enhancing generalization and behavioral control in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving feedback quality for Large Language Models is challenging and expensive, particularly for diverse training distributions. Narrow training data often leads to unintended generalizations, necessitating a better method.

Method: The authors propose contrastive weight steering, a post-training technique that edits model parameters by isolating weight-space behavior directions. This is achieved by computing weight deltas from two fine-tunes: one inducing desired behavior and the other inducing its opposite, and then adding or subtracting this direction to modify the model.

Result: The approach successfully mitigated sycophancy, induced misalignment, enhanced behavioral control on out-of-distribution tasks, and retained task performance while mitigating undesired behavioral drift during fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Contrastive weight steering is a promising method to enhance LLMs' behavioral control and mitigate undesired behaviors without sacrificing task performance. The technique can potentially detect emergent misalignments during training.

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that

### [58] [MIMIC-SR-ICD11: A Dataset for Narrative-Based Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05485)
*Yuexin Wu,Shiqi Wang,Vasile Rus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset for disease diagnosis based on self-reports and proposes LL-Rank, a method to process clinical reports for more accurate diagnostic label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better utilize self-reported clinical data, which often contains subtler yet crucial information that traditional EHR systems miss, and to align datasets with standardized medical terminology (ICD-11).

Method: The authors developed MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset and proposed LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that compares context-inclusive likelihoods to label-free priors to improve diagnostic predictions.

Result: LL-Rank outperformed existing approaches, such as GenMap, across several model types by isolating semantic alignment over label frequency biases. Results were validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that LL-Rank and the MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset advance accurate diagnostic predictions while preserving clinical nuances from self-reports, showing potential to improve clinical NLP systems.

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is the first benchmark focused on evaluating vision-language models in multilingual and culturally diverse settings across the Indian subcontinent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of culturally diverse and multilingual benchmarks for vision-language models, which are mostly Western-centric.

Method: Develop a benchmark, IndicVisionBench, covering English and 10 Indian languages for three multimodal tasks: OCR, MMT, and VQA across culturally grounded topics.

Result: IndicVisionBench consists of ~5K images and 37K QA pairs, revealing significant performance gaps of evaluated models in diverse contexts.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench highlights the limitations of current vision-language models and provides a framework to promote inclusive multimodal research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [60] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to detect shape artifacts in synthetic medical images, enhancing synthetic dataset reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges with synthetic data in machine learning, particularly ensuring the quality of synthetic images without artifacts or distortions.

Method: A two-stage framework: (i) A feature extractor analyzing angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based anomaly detector.

Result: The proposed method successfully detects anomalies with AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91 for synthetic mammography datasets and aligns with human evaluations.

Conclusion: This method enhances synthetic data quality by detecting shape-related artifacts, aiding in safer and more reliable applications in clinical settings.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [61] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Condition Preference Optimization (CPO) to improve text-to-image controllability by training on control conditions rather than generated images, achieving better results and computational efficiency compared to prior methods like ControlNet++.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in controllability and computational efficiency of current text-to-image generation techniques, specifically focusing on improving upon ControlNet and ControlNet++.

Method: The authors propose Condition Preference Optimization (CPO), which involves preference learning over generated control signals ($\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$) rather than images, reducing variance and computational cost.

Result: CPO significantly improves controllability beyond ControlNet++ in various tasks, achieving over 10% error reduction in segmentation tasks, 70–80% in human pose, and consistent improvements (2–5%) in edge and depth maps.

Conclusion: CPO outperforms existing methods in both controllability and efficiency, providing a more precise and computationally feasible solution to text-to-image generation challenges.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [62] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN) enhances foundation models for geospatial analysis, providing adaptive mechanisms like estimating task complexity and dynamic dropout modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the adaptation of foundation models for geospatial analysis that struggle with heterogeneity in satellite imagery and lack flexibility in decoders.

Method: DARN integrates a Task Complexity Predictor (TCP), Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), and Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) to dynamically adjust models based on image complexity.

Result: DARN achieves excellent performance in geospatial tasks, setting new state-of-the-art results in accuracy and robustness, outperforming prior methods in full and efficient adaptation paradigms.

Conclusion: DARN provides advanced solutions for the challenges in applying foundation models to geospatial analysis, offering better adaptability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework that creates global 3D cloud maps from satellite imagery to improve tropical cyclone analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting tropical cyclones is limited due to insufficient satellite data and challenges in resolving cloud properties critical to cyclone intensification.

Method: A pre-training and fine-tuning machine learning pipeline is developed to convert 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps using data from multiple global satellites.

Result: The model accurately reconstructs 3D cloud structures of intense tropical cyclones and generates global maps, filling gaps in satellite data where observations are missing.

Conclusion: This framework represents a significant step in understanding tropical cyclone intensification and holds potential for improving forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN for event-based eye tracking designed to work on microcontrollers, offering efficient performance without GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions often rely on powerful GPUs, limiting their deployment on embedded devices.

Method: The paper introduces EETnet, a CNN trained and quantized using a public dataset, with two architecture versions for pupil detection.

Result: EETnet enables microsecond-range eye tracking on microcontrollers, overcoming the need for GPU validation.

Conclusion: EETnet bridges the gap between event-based eye tracking and embedded deployment, providing efficient and scalable solutions.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, a per-point embedding using learned 3D Gaussians for faster and more efficient 3D recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in common implicit representations like PointNet and develop a faster, more memory-efficient alternative for 3D recognition tasks.

Method: The authors use optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to train 3D Gaussian encoders. They further enhance computational speed using geometric heuristics and filtering techniques.

Result: The proposed encoders achieve comparable accuracy while running faster (2.7 times faster) and using significantly less memory (46% less) and computation (88% fewer FLOPs). These encoders enhance the performance of Mamba3D in both speed and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders outperform traditional PointNets in speed and efficiency, making them suitable for real-time applications including CPU-only devices.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in generalist biomedical image segmentation models, specifically data redundancy and cross-domain transfer, proposing methods for achieving efficient training and minimizing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve efficiency and retention in biomedical image segmentation models by addressing training data redundancy and the impact of cross-domain transfer.

Method: A systematic empirical analysis is conducted using Cellpose. Proposed methods include a dataset quantization (DQ) strategy to identify diverse training subsets and selective DQ-based replay to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Key results include that segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, substantial data redundancy is identified, and selective data replay mitigates catastrophic forgetting effectively while sequencing training domains enhances generalization.

Conclusion: Efficient training in biomedical image segmentation requires data-centric strategies such as compact subsets, retention-aware learning, and domain-informed sequencing to enhance model performance and cross-domain adaptation.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available

*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a data-centric workflow combining active learning and pseudo-labeling to minimize manual labeling and enhance biomedical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies the challenges in biomedical image segmentation, including the need for large annotated datasets and limitations of large foundation models in handling specific datasets.

Method: The proposed method leverages pseudo-labels generated by foundation models and uses active learning to select a core-set for minimal manual annotation, enabling fine-tuning of nnU-Net for segmentation.

Result: The workflow reduces manual annotation requirements while maintaining a competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical and efficient solution for biomedical image segmentation tasks, integrating automated processes to minimize human intervention while improving accuracy.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to geometry denoising using pre-defined normal vectors (label vectors) and incorporates segmentation and total variation regularization in the optimization process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve geometry denoising by utilizing prior knowledge about surface normals and their similarity to label vectors while embedding segmentation in the process.

Method: The method involves using preferred normal vectors called label vectors and employs an optimization problem solved via split Bregman (ADMM) combined with second-order shape calculus for vertex updates.

Result: The approach introduces segmentation naturally into the denoising process and regularizes with a total variation term, utilizing mathematical optimization techniques.

Conclusion: This paradigm of geometry denoising provides an effective framework by incorporating prior knowledge, segmentation, and advanced calculus methods for optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique that uses an implicit self-prior and a dictionary of embeddings for generating high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The recovery of high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds is an ill-posed problem unless strong geometric priors are available.

Method: The authors develop an implicit neural representation trained with a small dictionary of learnable embeddings and an implicit distance field, integrating their results into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS) formulation.

Result: The approach leverages learned priors to regularize sparse regions while preserving fine geometric details, outperforming both classical and learning-based methods in high-fidelity surface generation.

Conclusion: This hybrid method effectively balances detail preservation and robustness, offering a superior solution for reconstructing surfaces from irregular point clouds.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Clinical-ComBAT, a tool for harmonizing diffusion-weighted MRI data in clinical scenarios with flexibility and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DW-MRI data harmonization methods like ComBAT face constraints in clinical settings due to reliance on linear relationships, fixed site numbers, and homogeneous populations, creating a need for a more adaptable approach for real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors develop Clinical-ComBAT, which independently harmonizes each site, employs a non-linear data model, uses site-specific normative references, adapts variance priors for small cohorts, and includes hyperparameter tuning and goodness-of-fit metrics.

Result: Clinical-ComBAT demonstrates improved alignment of diffusion metrics and greater applicability for normative modeling when tested on both simulated and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed Clinical-ComBAT method provides a robust tool for harmonizing multi-site DW-MRI data, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional harmonization approaches to enhance clinical utility.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines the effectiveness of Swin vision transformers in diagnosing ear diseases and highlights the impact of data leakage on model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy in ear diseases where a 27% misdiagnosis rate has been reported, demonstrating the need for advanced diagnostic tools.

Method: The study used otoscopic video data, selected frames via Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, and compared the performance of Swin transformers (v1 and v2) with ResNet models.

Result: Preliminary results showed high accuracies (100%, 99.1%, and 99.5%), but after identifying and addressing data leakage, corrected accuracies dropped significantly to 83% for Swin models and 82% for ResNet.

Conclusion: While Swin transformers have potential, proper data handling and preprocessing are crucial in developing reliable machine learning models for diagnosing ear diseases.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

Motivation: To tackle the global health issue of roadway traffic accidents and address the shortcomings of traditional safety studies and neural network estimators in capturing spatial complexity and model uncertainty.

Method: Developed a geospatial deep learning model leveraging satellite imagery to estimate fatal crash risks with a Beta probability distribution instead of deterministic outputs.

Result: The proposed model showed a 17-23% improvement in recall for identifying potential crash risks and provided better calibration compared to baselines.

Conclusion: This framework enables uncertainty-aware, reliable, and interpretable risk assessments, aiding safer autonomous navigation and offering scalable tools for urban planning and policymaking.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

### [73] [Learning to Restore Multi-Degraded Images via Ingredient Decoupling and Task-Aware Path Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04920)
*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Ying Zhang,Xichen Xu,Guannan Jiang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents IMDNet, a novel network tackling multi-degradation image restoration by decoupling, integrating, and dynamically selecting degradation ingredients for optimal restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting types of degradations (e.g., rain, noise, haze), and existing methods addressing single degradations lack practical effectiveness for such cases.

Method: The proposed network, IMDNet, incorporates a DIDBlock to decouple degradation ingredients statistically, a FBlock to fuse degraded information across levels, and a TABlock in the decoder for dynamic path selection based on multi-degradation representations.

Result: IMDNet demonstrates superior performance in restoring images affected by multiple degradations while maintaining strong efficacy in single-degradation restoration tasks.

Conclusion: IMDNet effectively adapts to both single and multi-degradation scenarios by leveraging advanced feature decoupling and adaptive restoration techniques, proving its practical and competitive robustness.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future
research in AI dentistry.

*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework using latent space representations and Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) to enhance watermarking for deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges of advanced deepfake detection, as current passive detectors struggle with generalization and proactive watermarks face trade-offs between robustness and fragility.

Method: The method employs high-dimensional latent space embedding and the MAARL paradigm to develop adaptive watermarking through an embedder and adversarial attacker simulations.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques with improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and 5.3% on CelebA-HQ datasets under manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging latent space and reinforcement learning paradigms for a robust watermarking approach, marking advancements in proactive deepfake detection.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLM, an optimized system enabling 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to render large scenes on consumer-grade GPUs by offloading memory to the CPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing popularity of 3DGS is hindered by its high memory requirements when applied to large or complex scenes, which exceed the capacity of consumer-grade GPUs.

Method: CLM offloads Gaussian data to CPU memory and uses a novel offloading strategy that exploits 3DGS’s memory access patterns for efficient pipelining, communication reduction, and overlapping computations.

Result: CLM successfully renders large scenes containing 100 million Gaussians using a single RTX4090 GPU while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The system effectively scales 3DGS for large scenes and addresses the GPU memory limitations through innovative strategies, broadening its usability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "PDS," a pattern-aware dual-modal diffusion framework and tissue refinement network to synthesize missing MRI modalities, improving neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of synthesizing fMRI and dMRI modalities due to signal differences and insufficient disease-related anatomical integration for neurodegenerative disease study.

Method: Developed PDS with a dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning and a tissue refinement network for microstructure improvements.

Result: PDS achieves state-of-the-art synthesis performance, improving PSNR/SSIM metrics over baselines. It demonstrates impactful diagnostic accuracy in hybrid real-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: PDS effectively addresses MRI modality synthesis barriers, enabling enhanced neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. Code is publicly available for replication and broader use.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

TL;DR: This paper explores the geometric understanding of deep neural networks (DNNs), showing optimized shapes can serve as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial methods through a novel framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on geometry in DNN research, despite its equal importance alongside texture for visual recognition.

Method: An end-to-end framework utilizing Fourier series for shape parameterization, a winding number-based translation for pixel mapping, and signal energy constraints to ensure physically plausible shapes.

Result: The study demonstrates the potency of optimized shapes in classification, model interpretation, and adversarial settings, offering new tools for geometric understanding in DNNs.

Conclusion: This framework advances understanding of DNN geometry, providing significant contributions to model interpretation and adversarial techniques while opening new research directions in machine perception.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

*Dylan Peek,Matthew P. Skerritt,Siddharth Pritam,Stephan Chalup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge in Topological Data Analysis by introducing a new method for generating labeled 3D datasets, specifically tailored for supervised learning tasks, and applies it to train a neural network genus estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods are computationally intense and lack sufficient labeled datasets for training neural network-based estimators tailored for supervised learning.

Method: The authors developed a Repulsive Surface algorithm to systematically generate labeled 3D datasets with controlled topological invariants. They designed a genus estimator using 3D convolutional transformer architecture.

Result: The synthetic 3D dataset enabled training of a genus-estimator network, revealing that geometric complexity affects accuracy as deformations increase.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational labeled 3D dataset and generation mechanism that advances the training and benchmarking of neural network-based models for TDA tasks.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Sticker Semantic Similarity task with the Triple-S benchmark and proposes GSE, a lightweight model for improved sticker understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stickers are increasingly utilized in visual communication, yet their semantic relationships are hard to decode due to their symbolic and diverse nature.

Method: The authors created the Triple-S benchmark with human-annotated sticker pairs and developed GSE—a model that learns robust sticker embeddings using this benchmark and other datasets.

Result: GSE outperformed existing models in tasks including unseen sticker handling, emotion classification, and sticker-to-sticker retrieval.

Conclusion: The release of Triple-S and GSE establishes new tools for standardized evaluation and advances research in sticker understanding and retrieval.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

TL;DR: This paper identifies a bias toward language modality in LVLM architectures and proposes refining textual embeddings with visual features to address the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address an inherent modality imbalance in LVLM architectures that leads to a bias toward language and causes hallucinations.

Method: The method integrates average-pooled visual features into textual embeddings to improve visual grounding and cross-modal alignment.

Result: The approach reduces hallucinations and enhances visual grounding on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that refining textual embeddings with visual features is effective, suggesting further exploration of sophisticated fusion methods for future improvements.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRE-SLCL, an end-to-end method for Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation addressing challenges in processing gigapixel-sized slides with limited GPU capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational difficulties with gigapixel WSIs and improve tasks like cancer subtyping, recognition, and mutation prediction.

Method: Dynamic Residual Encoding with Slide-Level Contrastive Learning (DRE-SLCL) is used, leveraging a memory bank for WSI features and combining encoding techniques to compute slide-level representations.

Result: Experiments show that DRE-SLCL effectively supports tasks such as cancer subtyping, recognition, and mutation prediction.

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL is a promising method for WSI representation, enabling advanced cancer analysis while overcoming GPU limitations.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture, eliminating the need for traditional setups like cameras or wearable devices.

Method: The method leverages a dual-level feature extractor for pressure data, a hierarchical diffusion model for motion generation, and combines physical and semantic cues to ensure accurate motion synthesis.

Result: The study establishes Pressure2Motion as a pioneering model that produces high-fidelity and physically plausible motions, setting a new benchmark in this field.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion introduces an innovative approach for motion generation, establishes a novel benchmark (MPL), and showcases promising results with plans for public code release.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRIS methods often involve complex multimodal fusion or multi-stage designs, which lack a streamlined approach and adaptability.

Method: The paper introduces NTP-MRISeg, which reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive next-token prediction over multimodal tokenized sequences and applies three novel strategies: Next-k Token Prediction, Token-level Contrastive Learning, and Hard Error Token optimization.

Result: NTP-MRISeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ by simplifying MRIS design and improving boundary sensitivity and handling distribution challenges.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg presents an effective, unified framework for MRIS, demonstrating better generalization and adaptability through innovative prediction and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PITTA, a framework for test-time adaptation in monocular depth estimation, using pose-agnostic techniques and instance-aware masking for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of monocular depth estimation lies in adapting models to varying and dynamic environments during deployment, especially as training environments often differ from real-world conditions.

Method: PITTA utilizes a pose-agnostic test-time adaptation approach combined with instance-aware image masking to exclude static objects and dynamic object segmentation. Additionally, edge extraction methods improve input image and depth map quality.

Result: Experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets show PITTA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods in test-time adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: PITTA is effective in enhancing monocular depth estimation during test-time adaptation, proving to be robust in dynamic real-world environments and providing notable performance improvements.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods prioritize data volume, often leading to limited semantic diversity and shallow captions.

Method: Role-SynthCLIP utilizes multi-perspective role-playing prompts in MLLMs to generate semantically diverse captions with improved image-text alignment.

Result: The approach achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on MS COCO validation set using 1M synthetic pairs, outperforming previous baselines trained on larger datasets.

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP enhances caption diversity and alignment in CLIP training, proving effective with fewer synthetic data pairs and setting a state-of-the-art performance benchmark.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

### [87] [SurgiATM: A Physics-Guided Plug-and-Play Model for Deep Learning-Based Smoke Removal in Laparoscopic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05059)
*Mingyu Sheng,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Guoyan Zheng,Ron Kikinis,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurgiATM, a novel lightweight module designed to enhance surgical smoke removal during laparoscopic surgery by integrating physics-based atmospheric models with deep learning, achieving higher accuracy and generalizability. Extensive validation on three datasets showcases its low cost, effectiveness, and plug-and-play capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generation of surgical smoke during laparoscopic surgery degrades endoscopic visual quality, increasing risks of surgical errors and hindering clinical decision-making and computer-assisted analysis. There is a critical need for effective surgical smoke removal to ensure patient safety and operative efficiency.

Method: The proposed method, SurgiATM, bridges physics-based atmospheric modeling with data-driven deep learning to develop a lightweight and plug-and-play module. SurgiATM can be integrated into various surgical desmoking architectures with minimal computational overhead and only two hyperparameters, preserving the original architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets involving diverse procedures and desmoking methods showed that SurgiATM improves the generalizability and accuracy of existing models, reduces restoration errors, and achieves these benefits without adding extra trainable parameters.

Conclusion: SurgiATM is a convenient, low-cost, and effective solution for surgical smoke removal during laparoscopic surgery. Its lightweight design and high generalizability make it suitable for seamless integration into existing systems, addressing clinical needs effectively.

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

### [88] [Deep learning models are vulnerable, but adversarial examples are even more vulnerable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05073)
*Jun Li,Yanwei Xu,Keran Li,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that adversarial examples show higher confidence sensitivity to occlusion compared to clean samples and introduces methods for robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean samples for improved robustness and detection in DNNs against adversarial attacks.

Method: Empirical tests on CIFAR-10 using nine canonical attack models, introducing SMCE to measure confidence fluctuations under occlusion and proposing SWM-AED for detection of adversarial examples.

Result: SMCE revealed adversarial examples have greater confidence volatility under occlusion, and SWM-AED achieved notable detection performance (accuracy up to 96.5%).

Conclusion: Adversarial examples are more sensitive to occlusion compared to clean samples, and SWM-AED offers a robust detection method, improving adversarial robustness without catastrophic overfitting.

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

*Ruolin Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Zhaoyang Li,Yuzhen Li,Xueping Wang,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for generating a virtual dataset and enhancing domain generalization in person re-identification (Re-ID), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual datasets for person Re-ID have challenges like complex development and poor domain generalization, limiting their application.

Method: Authors propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP), which synthesizes a virtual dataset using a diffusion model (GenePerson) and a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn domain-invariant features.

Result: The method generates a large-scale virtual dataset, GenePerson, with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. Models trained on GenePerson with PDM outperform both real and virtual Re-ID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses privacy concerns, construction complexity, and generalization issues in Re-ID datasets, offering a precedent-setting solution.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces HFLS-Weather dataset and a reinforcement learning framework for robust visual performance in adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models trained on synthetic fixed-parameter data cannot adapt well to complex, real-world degradations caused by adverse weather.

Method: Construct a high-fidelity, physics-driven HFLS-Weather dataset and implement a dual-level reinforcement learning framework for training.

Result: The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance under diverse weather conditions through localized and global optimization techniques.

Conclusion: Using HFLS-Weather and reinforcement learning enables adaptive and improved perception across adverse weather scenarios.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

### [91] [Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Retinal OCT Images: A UK Biobank Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05106)
*Yasemin Turkan,F. Boray Tek,M. Serdar Nazlı,Öykü Eren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study applied deep learning directly to raw OCT B-scan images for Alzheimer's disease early detection, achieving limited performance but providing foundational insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging, particularly by leveraging subtle retinal changes years before clinical diagnosis.

Method: Using deep learning, specifically pretrained models like ResNet-34 and RETFound transformer, with subject-level cross-validation and OCT-specific augmentations.

Result: ResNet-34 achieved an AUC of 0.62 in predicting AD within 4 years preceding diagnosis, but results indicate limited clinical applicability.

Conclusion: Findings confirm structural retinal differences linked to AD but highlight the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches for effective early detection.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lane detection system using vertical roadside posts instead of traditional lane markings, focusing on snowy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in snow-covered conditions faces major challenges due to absent or occluded lane markings.

Method: The approach detects vertical roadside posts and fits a lane using a Bezier curve model. It also introduces a synthetic dataset 'SnowyLane' with annotated winter driving frames.

Result: The method shows significant robustness improvement in heavy snow compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a promising solution for reliable lane detection in winter and contributes a valuable dataset for future research.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces JWTH, a novel pathology foundation model merging global and cell-level morphology analysis for improved AI-based biomarker detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-based pathology models focus largely on global patch-level embeddings and neglect cell-level morphology, limiting their accuracy and interpretability.

Method: JWTH combines large-scale self-supervised pretraining, cell-centric post-tuning, and attention pooling to integrate local and global token information.

Result: JWTH outperforms previous models with up to 8.3% better balanced accuracy and a 1.2% average improvement in biomarker detection across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: JWTH advances interpretable and robust biomarker detection in digital pathology by integrating cell-specific and global morphological insights.

Abstract: AI-based biomarkers can infer molecular features directly from hematoxylin &
eosin (H&E) slides, yet most pathology foundation models (PFMs) rely on global
patch-level embeddings and overlook cell-level morphology. We present a PFM
model, JWTH (Joint-Weighted Token Hierarchy), which integrates large-scale
self-supervised pretraining with cell-centric post-tuning and attention pooling
to fuse local and global tokens. Across four tasks involving four biomarkers
and eight cohorts, JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and 1.2%
average improvement over prior PFMs, advancing interpretable and robust
AI-based biomarker detection in digital pathology.

*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for photorealistic 3D reconstruction in sparse multi-view video setups is proposed, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques and enabling segmented dynamic reconstruction with less supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filmmaking often involves sparse camera setups due to budget constraints, leading to challenges in capturing complex dynamic 3D features using existing methods.

Method: The approach splits Gaussians and deformation fields into separate foreground and background components, optimized separately using masks for initial frames and different loss functions. Foreground learns comprehensive dynamics (color, position, rotation), while background adjusts minimally.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D/2.5D datasets, surpassing competitors by up to 3 PSNR with smaller model sizes, and enabling segmented reconstructions with dynamic and transparent textures.

Conclusion: The proposed method is highly effective for sparse multi-view video setups in filmmaking, achieving superior reconstruction quality without dense mask supervision.

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

*Alexander Lappe,Martin A. Giese*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIXEL, a knowledge distillation approach enhancing feature map production for vision models, achieving better performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of requiring high-resolution inputs and excessive computational demands in the DINOv3 model for producing fine-grained feature maps.

Method: The method proposed is BRIXEL, where a student model learns to reproduce dense feature maps at higher resolution through knowledge distillation.

Result: BRIXEL improves downstream task performance and creates feature maps closely resembling those of the teacher model, but with less computational cost.

Conclusion: BRIXEL represents a simpler, effective alternative to existing models, maintaining high-quality outputs while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MUSE, a self-supervised learning framework tailored for nucleus detection and classification in histopathology, leveraging nucleus-based local self-distillation for effective representation learning without requiring heavy annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for nucleus detection and classification in histopathology struggle with reliance on manual annotations and underutilization of large-scale unlabeled data.

Method: The authors propose MUSE, a self-supervised learning framework utilizing 'NuLo' (Nucleus-based Local self-distillation) for flexible self-distillation, coupled with a specialized encoder-decoder architecture and large field-of-view semi-supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show MUSE outperforming state-of-the-art supervision-based models and generic pathology foundation models in nucleus detection and classification.

Conclusion: MUSE successfully tackles annotation challenges in histopathology analysis, enabling models to achieve superior performance in nucleus-level representation learning.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a contour tracking algorithm designed for precise infrared (IR) and RGB object segmentation, outperforming traditional contour-based techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand detailed segmentation capabilities beyond color-focused methods to infrared (IR) ships and diverse RGB objects.

Method: WtL2 adapts the Walk the Lines framework by modifying contour tracking techniques and input detectors for IR ships, refining object contours to achieve precise segmentation.

Result: WtL2 achieves high-quality segmentation, outperforms modern contour-based methods, and delivers high Intersection over Union (IoU) for closed contours, enhancing detailed segmentation capabilities.

Conclusion: WtL2 is a significant advancement for specialized applications needing detailed segmentation, providing high-quality results for IR and RGB object segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeControl is a framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models without retraining, enabling efficient, coherent image generation with 5% additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to flexibly and efficiently control spatial/semantic structure in diffusion models, requiring handcrafted maps or incurring high inference costs.

Method: FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a key timestep and incorporates Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD), enabling better attention quality and structural control without retraining.

Result: Improved quality and stability in image generation, supporting compositional control and stronger prompt alignment, all at minimal cost.

Conclusion: FreeControl offers a new efficient paradigm for diffusion models, allowing intuitive design and aligned image generation with training-free, flexible compositional controls.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces 4D3R, a novel framework for pose-free dynamic neural rendering, achieving improved outcomes in dynamic scene reconstruction while significantly optimizing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos without known camera poses has limited advancements, especially compared to static scene representation methods.

Method: The paper proposes 4D3R, a two-stage framework that uses 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement using innovations like Motion-Aware Bundle Adjustment (MA-BA) and Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS).

Result: Experiments showed 4D3R improves dynamic scene reconstruction by up to 1.8dB PSNR compared to state-of-the-art methods and reduces computational costs by five times.

Conclusion: 4D3R effectively decouples static and dynamic scene components, providing high-quality results in dynamic object scenarios and showcasing potential for efficient neural rendering applications.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

*Xincheng Yao,Yan Luo,Zefeng Qian,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of using ImageNet-pretrained feature networks for anomaly detection (AD) by introducing a specialized representation learning framework with novel contrastive losses and pretraining on a dedicated large-scale AD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ImageNet pretraining does not address the specific needs of anomaly detection, like distinguishing between normal and abnormal. Additionally, distribution shifts between natural images and industrial anomaly detection datasets can make pretrained ImageNet features suboptimal.

Method: The framework includes angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to enhance feature discrimination between normal and abnormal data, pretraining on a dedicated AD dataset (RealIAD), and leveraging residual features for generalizable representations.

Result: Pretrained features were evaluated on five AD datasets and methods, consistently demonstrating superior performance across diverse scenarios compared to ImageNet-based features.

Conclusion: Pretraining tailored representations with AD-focused strategies and datasets significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy, marking advancement in representation learning for industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

*Mohamed Sanim Akremi,Rim Slama,Hedi Tabia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online recognition system for skeleton-based motion recognition using SPD matrices and a Siamese network, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of online continuous motion recognition using skeleton-based data.

Method: The system utilizes a detector and classifier with Semi-Positive Definite matrix representation, paired with a Siamese network.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate high accuracy and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in motion recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach advances online skeleton-based motion recognition, offering a flexible and accurate system for real-world applications.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

Motivation: To address challenges in delineating CRLM intraoperatively with iUS caused by low contrast, noise, and operator dependency, aiming to enhance precision and simplify workflows.

Method: Eighty-five 3D iUS volumes were used to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net segmentation model. Two training variants were compared: full-volume and cropped-region approaches. Accuracy was tested on retrospective and prospective datasets using metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient.

Result: The cropped-volume model showed significant improvement over the full-volume model in segmentation accuracy and execution speed (~4x faster). Prospective intraoperative tests confirmed consistent and robust performance for surgical navigation.

Conclusion: The cropped 3D U-Net model enables efficient, near real-time CRLM segmentation with minimal operator input, improving surgery precision while reducing workload and time requirements.

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepEyesV2, an agentic multimodal model designed to comprehend and invoke external tools for reasoning, integrating a specialized two-stage training method alongside a new benchmark RealX-Bench for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance multimodal AI by enabling models to not only comprehend input but also actively use external tools for reasoning, addressing the challenge of robust tool-use behavior.

Method: Proposed a two-stage training process: (1) a cold-start phase for establishing basic tool-use patterns, and (2) a reinforcement learning phase for refining tool usage. A carefully constructed dataset emphasizing beneficial tool usage and a novel evaluation benchmark (RealX-Bench) were also created.

Result: DeepEyesV2 demonstrates effective performance in real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-based tasks, leveraging task-specific tool adaptations and selectively invoking tools for contextual decision-making.

Conclusion: The study offers strategies for building agentic multimodal models, showcasing the benefits of a structured training process and a robust evaluation system to promote innovation in multimodal AI development.

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CuisineSense, a wearable system combining smartwatch and smart glasses data for accurate dietary monitoring, specifically classifying diverse Chinese food types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of self-report methods prone to recall bias and wearable systems that lack coverage for diverse food categories, particularly Chinese cuisine.

Method: The method employs hand motion data from smartwatches and head dynamics from smart glasses, along with a two-stage detection pipeline focusing on eating state detection and fine-grained food type classification.

Result: CuisineSense shows high accuracy in identifying eating states and classifying food types, based on a dataset of 27.5 hours of recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants.

Conclusion: CuisineSense provides a privacy-preserving, wearable-based solution for comprehensive dietary monitoring, significantly improving coverage for diverse food types, including Chinese cuisine.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Motivation: Current online Video-LLMs struggle with real-time responsiveness and maintaining narrative coherence during continuous video analysis.

Method: LiveStar introduces adaptive streaming decoding with incremental video-language alignment, proactive response-silence decoding, and memory-aware acceleration techniques. It also utilizes the OmniStar dataset for training and benchmarking.

Result: LiveStar demonstrated an average 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness, 18.1% reduced timing difference, and 12.0% faster FPS compared to existing models.

Conclusion: LiveStar establishes a state-of-the-art approach for online video understanding with enhanced responsiveness, accuracy, and efficiency. It is supported by the OmniStar dataset for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for

dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation metrics for 3D point cloud generative models, introduces improved methods like Density-Aware Chamfer Distance and Surface Normal Concordance, and proposes a new state-of-the-art model named Diffusion Point Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in the robustness and comprehensiveness of existing metrics used for evaluating generated 3D point clouds and aim to develop a high-fidelity generative model for 3D structures.

Method: Proposes the Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) and Surface Normal Concordance (SNC) as improved evaluation metrics. Introduces Diffusion Point Transformer leveraging serialized patch attention for better generative modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the superiority of their model, achieving state-of-the-art quality in generated point clouds.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and model enhance robustness, geometric fidelity, and evaluation comprehensiveness in 3D point cloud generation, establishing new benchmarks for quality.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) to embed semantic sentence-level information into images for steganography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current steganography methods in embedding semantically rich, sentence-level information, especially in the AIGC era where data capacity is increasingly significant.

Method: The authors propose Sentence-to-Image Steganography supported by a benchmark, Invisible Text (IVT), and a Semantic Steganographic Language Model ($S^2LM$), primarily leveraging LLMs across the embedding process.

Result: Both qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight that the proposed method successfully advances semantic steganographic capabilities.

Conclusion: This study proves that Semantic Steganography utilizing LLMs enhances the embedding of high-level textual information in images, showing promising applications in steganography advancements.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Artic4D dataset and proposes CanonSeg4D framework for 4D panoptic segmentation, utilizing temporal data and canonical alignment to enhance dynamic object understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing methods overlook the dynamic nature of articulated objects, neglecting the use of 4D temporal data. Furthermore, the field lacks a benchmark dataset to advance research.

Method: The authors developed Artic4D dataset derived from PartNet Mobility and synthetic sensor data. They introduced CanonSeg4D, a framework that estimates per-frame offsets to map observed object parts to a canonical space for part-level segmentation and temporal consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CanonSeg4D delivers superior accuracy for panoptic segmentation, especially in complex scenarios, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling and canonical alignment are effective for understanding dynamic objects and pave the way for advancements in 4D articulated object perception.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses heavily on text-to-motion generation, neglecting deeper motion understanding tasks. Current datasets are insufficient, featuring short sequences with sparse annotations.

Method: The authors developed a dataset called Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo), containing rich temporal annotations for multi-action motion sequences. They propose a model called DEMO, integrating a large language model with a motion adapter for this task.

Result: DEMO significantly outperforms existing methods on the newly introduced dataset (CompMo) and adapted benchmarks, proving to be effective.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundational dataset and method for advancing motion understanding within 3D human motion sequences and sets benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PreResQ-R1, a reinforcement learning framework for visual quality assessment that merges score regression and ranking, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing multimodal models in visual quality assessment, such as shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and weak cross-domain generalization.

Method: The proposed method is a dual-branch reward system called PreResQ-R1, which leverages reinforcement learning and introduces Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reasoning-driven optimization. It integrates a chain-of-thought reasoning approach for both absolute and relative visual quality judgments.

Result: PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks under SRCC and PLCC metrics, with notable improvements of 5.30% and 2.15%, respectively. It also produces human-aligned reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances perceptual quality assessment, enabling interpretable, fine-grained reasoning and demonstrating strong benchmark performance, while reinforcing advancements in both image and video quality evaluation.

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations in creating high-quality personalized hand avatars stem from the lack of comprehensive datasets with accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution imagery, and diverse subject representation.

Method: The authors created PALM, a large-scale dataset consisting of 13k hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, and proposed PALM-Net, a model leveraging physically based inverse rendering for hand avatar personalization.

Result: PALM-Net demonstrates the ability to create realistic and relightable hand avatars from single images, supported by a diverse and extensive dataset.

Conclusion: PALM and PALM-Net provide new opportunities for advancing hand modeling research, offering tools for realistic, diverse, and personalized hand avatar generation.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

Result: Experiments on S3LI datasets demonstrate that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while improving pose estimation in low-texture regions.

Conclusion: MPRF provides interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, achieving a balance of accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, showcasing the potential for foundation models to integrate place recognition and pose estimation.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

### [116] [Sharing the Learned Knowledge-base to Estimate Convolutional Filter Parameters for Continual Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05421)
*Aupendu Kar,Krishnendu Ghosh,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses continual learning for image restoration and proposes a convolution layer modification, enabling the learning of new restoration tasks efficiently without modifying the backbone structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to tackle the challenge of continual learning in the domain of image restoration, focusing on adapting to diverse restoration tasks without forgetting prior knowledge or requiring extensive architectural changes.

Method: The approach involves a simple modification of the convolution layer that allows the model to adapt to new restoration tasks while preserving the knowledge of previous tasks. This method avoids the need for architectural reengineering or significant computational costs.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can introduce new restoration tasks without degrading the performance of previously learned tasks. Additionally, it enhances the performance of new tasks by leveraging the knowledge from prior tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective continual learning approach for image restoration tasks with minimal computation and no need for structural changes, presenting a flexible and efficient solution for diverse restoration challenges.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

*Dogucan Yaman,Seymanur Akti,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a text-to-talking-face synthesis model that creates natural and synchronized speech and facial motion using a two-stage training process with latent speech representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in generating synchronized facial motion and natural speech in text-to-talking-face synthesis models, particularly by tackling issues arising from distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted features.

Method: The proposed framework uses HierSpeech++ for latent speech representation and introduces a Text-to-Vec module to generate Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text. A two-stage training process—pretraining on embeddings followed by fine-tuning on TTS outputs—ensures better alignment and quality.

Result: The framework achieves improved audio-visual alignment, preserves speaker identity, and delivers more natural and expressive results compared to traditional cascaded pipelines.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates superior performance in lip synchronization and visual realism, proving the effectiveness of latent feature conditioning and the two-stage training strategy.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces gitmerge3D, a method that efficiently reduces token count in 3D point cloud transformers by up to 95% while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in 3D point cloud transformers caused by redundant token representations.

Method: The authors propose gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token counts substantially while preserving performance.

Result: The method successfully reduces token count significantly, demonstrating improved computational efficiency across multiple 3D vision tasks.

Conclusion: The work challenges the assumption that higher token counts equate to better performance, proposing gitmerge3D as a scalable solution for 3D vision models.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

*Olivier Dietrich,Merlin Alfredsson,Emilia Arens,Nando Metzger,Torben Peters,Linus Scheibenreif,Jan Dirk Wegner,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of medium-resolution Copernicus program imagery for building damage assessment during natural disasters, introducing a dataset called xBD-S12 and demonstrating its effectiveness despite resolution limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide disaster response efforts, but the availability of very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is often limited.

Method: The authors create and test the xBD-S12 dataset using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, comparing its damage assessment performance to established benchmarks like xBD.

Result: The results show that medium-resolution imagery is useful for damage detection, with simpler models performing better for generalization across different disasters.

Conclusion: Copernicus images, despite their moderate resolution, are effective for wide-area building damage assessment, and the released dataset and tools support further research and application.

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

*Jakub Paplham,Vojtech Franc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to estimate the year a photograph was taken based on faces in the image, utilizing a large released dataset and a probabilistic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photographs often lack temporal metadata, and knowing when they were taken can provide historical, social, or contextual insights, particularly by leveraging facial information.

Method: The authors use a probabilistic framework combining face recognition and age estimation models with temporal priors. They developed a dataset (CSFD-1.6M) with over 1.6 million annotated faces for this purpose.

Result: The model consistently outperforms scene-based baselines, especially for images with multiple identifiable people, and shows improved performance by aggregating information from multiple faces.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the utility of combining facial evidence with probabilistic tools and a novel dataset for accurate photo dating.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow boiling can dissipate high heat loads efficiently, but sudden shifts in flow regimes disrupt performance. Neuromorphic sensors enable real-time monitoring for flow regime classification, surpassing traditional optical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sudden flow regime shifts can compromise the efficiency and reliability of flow boiling systems; real-time, accurate monitoring is needed but conventional optical methods fail to capture transient behaviors effectively.

Method: Authors propose a real-time flow regime classification framework using neuromorphic sensors, detecting brightness changes at pixels without full-frame reconstruction, along with event-based and frame-based data models.

Result: Event-based long short-term memory models outperform frame-based approaches, achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a low 0.28 ms processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables reliable, low-latency real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal systems, improving dynamic flow monitoring performance.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in detecting tiny and complex objects by enhancing feature extraction and fusion through cross-modal interaction between text and visuals.

Conclusion: Integrating natural language processing with advanced backbone architectures improves small object detection accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, demonstrating adaptability in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,
and adaptability to real-world challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN is proposed as a new lightweight medical image segmentation network that improves accuracy, reduces complexity, and enhances interpretability compared to existing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of both convolutional and Transformer architectures in medical image segmentation, such as lack of adaptive nonlinearity, transparency, and scalability due to high complexity.

Method: GroupKAN introduces two novel modules: Grouped KAN Transform to reduce complexity by partitioning channels and Grouped KAN Activation for efficient nonlinearity within groups.

Result: GroupKAN achieved an average IoU of 79.80% on three benchmarks, outperforming U-KAN by +1.11%, with only 47.6% of its parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M).

Conclusion: GroupKAN improves accuracy, scalability, and interpretability in medical image segmentation compared to previous methods like U-KAN, making it efficient and lightweight for practical use.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

*Junwen Pan,Qizhe Zhang,Rui Zhang,Ming Lu,Xin Wan,Yuan Zhang,Chang Liu,Qi She*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TimeSearch-R, a novel approach for temporal search in videos, enhancing reasoning and search efficiency through reinforcement learning and self-verification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current temporal search methods which rely on hand-crafted search processes lacking end-to-end optimization.

Method: Proposes TimeSearch-R, leveraging reinforcement learning (GRPO-CSV), integrating reasoning with searching, and introducing Completeness Self-Verification to improve exploration and logical consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench, Haystack-Ego4D, and LongVideoBench, outperforming state-of-the-art models like Qwen2.5-VL and Video-R1.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R advances temporal search frameworks by establishing improved strategies for video understanding and reasoning, setting new standards in long-form video analysis.

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of spatial awareness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without harming their general capabilities.

Method: The authors develop a large-scale dataset (VST-P) for spatial perception, a curated dataset (VST-R) for spatial reasoning, and use a progressive training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: The VST framework achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks, like 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, demonstrating improvements in visuospatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed spatial tuning paradigm significantly improves VLMs' capabilities, supporting advancements toward AI with human-like physical understanding.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of RISC-V GPUs equipped with custom HDC instructions to provide energy-efficient, high-performance solutions for hybrid neural network workloads.

Abstract: Machine learning based on neural networks has advanced rapidly, but the high
energy consumption required for training and inference remains a major
challenge. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight,
brain-inspired alternative that enables high parallelism but often suffers from
lower accuracy on complex visual tasks. To overcome this, hybrid accelerators
combining HDC and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed,
though their adoption is limited by poor generalizability and programmability.
The rise of open-source RISC-V architectures has created new opportunities for
domain-specific GPU design. Unlike traditional proprietary GPUs, emerging
RISC-V-based GPUs provide flexible, programmable platforms suitable for custom
computation models such as HDC. In this study, we design and implement custom
GPU instructions optimized for HDC operations, enabling efficient processing
for hybrid HDC-CNN workloads. Experimental results using four types of custom
HDC instructions show a performance improvement of up to 56.2 times in
microbenchmark tests, demonstrating the potential of RISC-V GPUs for

TL;DR: This paper discusses estimating GPU stress using telemetry data and hardware performance counters to ensure reliability under sustained workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU reliability concerns arise due to potential faults during prolonged workloads, which may corrupt computations and produce incorrect results.

Method: The authors propose combining GPU telemetry parameters with hardware performance counters to evaluate stress caused by various applications.

Result: Experimental results show that GPU stress can be estimated using efficiency metrics, including throughput, issued instructions, and stall events.

Conclusion: Monitoring telemetry and performance counters enables predictive analysis of GPU aging effects and workload-induced stress, essential for ensuring reliable operation in high-performance computing scenarios.

Abstract: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are specialized accelerators in data centers
and high-performance computing (HPC) systems, enabling the fast execution of
compute-intensive applications, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
However, sustained workloads can impose significant stress on GPU components,
raising reliability concerns due to potential faults that corrupt the
intermediate application computations, leading to incorrect results. Estimating
the stress induced by an application is thus crucial to predict reliability
(with\,special\,emphasis\,on\,aging\,effects). In this work, we combine online
telemetry parameters and hardware performance counters to assess GPU stress
induced by different applications. The experimental results indicate the stress
induced by a parallel workload can be estimated by combining telemetry data and
Performance Counters that reveal the efficiency in the resource usage of the
target workload. For this purpose the selected performance counters focus on
measuring the i) throughput, ii) amount of issued instructions and iii) stall
events.

TL;DR: FuseFlow is a compiler for converting sparse machine learning models in PyTorch into optimized dataflow graphs for reconfigurable architectures, improving performance and fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models require efficiency due to scalability needs. Sparse computation and specialized dataflow hardware offer solutions, but effective software tools for optimizing sparse operations are lacking.

Method: FuseFlow converts sparse models into fused sparse dataflow graphs, supports cross-expression kernel fusion, parallelization, dataflow ordering, and optimization techniques like sparsity blocking, targeting RDAs.

Result: Achieved performance improvements, including a ~2.7x speedup for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse attention. Demonstrated that full fusion is not always optimal, and fusion granularity depends on individual models.

Conclusion: FuseFlow provides advanced fusion strategies and optimizations for sparse computation on RDAs, enabling efficient model execution and identifying suboptimal configurations for improved performance.

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse

### [130] [Stateful KV Cache Management for LLMs: Balancing Space, Time, Accuracy, and Positional Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686)
*Pratik Poudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes KV cache management strategies in LLMs, examining their influence on inference quality and proposing improved methods for cache eviction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache growth poses challenges in maintaining model generation quality during multi-turn interactions, especially beyond trained context windows.

Method: Empirical analysis using stateful benchmarking frameworks to evaluate cache management strategies and their impacts on positional encodings.

Result: LLM generation quality degrades sharply when KV cache exceeds trained context limits, and disrupting positional coherence further worsens outputs.

Conclusion: Eviction techniques should respect architectural constraints, maintain positional structure, and focus on holistic cache health for optimal inference quality.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

*Yue Xun,Jiaxing Xu,Wenbo Gao,Chen Yang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve brain disorder classification by targeting specific neuronal frequency bands instead of treating BOLD signals as uniform time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat BOLD signals as single time series, neglecting multi-frequency aspects crucial for understanding neurological disorders.

Method: The proposed framework uses Adaptive Cascade Decomposition for sub-band selection and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to analyze interactions across frequency bands, integrated into a Unified-GCN for diagnostic predictions.

Result: Experimental evaluations on ADNI and ABIDE datasets show the proposed method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by accounting for individual variability and disorder-specific frequency disruptions in brain connectivity analysis.

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how selection of loss functions impacts neural network output by drawing connections to probabilistic assumptions and statistical underpinnings.

Method: Analyzes common activation functions and loss functions mathematically, linking them to probability distributions and statistical modeling principles.

Result: Demonstrates how loss functions like MSE, MAE, and Cross-Entropy imply different probability assumptions and connects these to neural network training scenarios.

Conclusion: Selecting loss functions is equivalent to modeling specific probability distributions, showcasing the importance of aligning statistical justification with deep learning model design.

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its
output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes
common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear,
sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their
appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the
selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model.
This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical
principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss
function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the
model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized
Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios
of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output
encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

*Qianyang Li,Xingjun Zhang,Peng Tao,Shaoxun Wang,Yancheng Pan,Jia Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AWEMixer introduces an adaptive approach for long-term IoT time series forecasting by addressing challenges of error accumulation and non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges like non-stationary and multi-scale sensor signals in IoT environments and improve forecasting quality without blurring transient temporal patterns.

Method: AWEMixer uses two main innovations—Frequency Router for periodic global weighting and Coherent Gated Fusion Block for integrating prominent frequency features with multi-scale temporal representations.

Result: AWEMixer outperforms transformer-based and MLP-based models across seven benchmarks in long-sequence forecasting, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AWEMixer achieves more accurate forecasting by leveraging adaptive wavelet enhancements and frequency features, offering robust solutions for long-term time series prediction.

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate
that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared
with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence
time series forecasting. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced framework that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks with a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer for improved Remaining Useful Life prediction in industrial systems, demonstrating lower error rates compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial reliability demands precise Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions, yet current approaches fail to capture high-resolution temporal patterns and prioritize features dynamically.

Method: The proposed method integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks for fine-grained temporal extraction, a Bi-LSTM enhanced Temporal Fusion Transformer to bridge dependencies, and a multi-time-window approach for adaptability.

Result: The framework reduces RMSE by up to 5.5% on benchmarks, showcasing enhanced prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The novel architecture improves industrial RUL prediction, highlighting the potential of combining advanced time-series models for better prognostics.

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a
multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating
conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its
improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing
critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness
of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced
time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

*Liu Jiang,Zerui Bao,Shiqi Sheng,Di Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a design for an instruction prefetcher optimized for large-scale networked services, improving latency and energy efficiency by leveraging spatial clustering, hierarchical metadata storage, and an online ML controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern cloud workloads and networked services suffer from inflated latency and energy usage due to growing instruction footprints in deep software stacks and microservice orchestration. Instruction prefetching techniques need refinement to align with these challenges.

Method: The authors build on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP) by introducing compressed entries for spatial clustering, hierarchical metadata storage to virtualize bulk metadata, and an online machine learning controller to score prefetch profitability based on application contexts.

Result: The proposed design achieves comparable speedups to EIP with reduced on-chip state and enhances energy efficiency for networked services in data center applications.

Conclusion: The paper successfully aligns instruction prefetching with modern SLO-driven systems, providing scalable solutions to reduce latency and energy consumption in cloud applications, especially benefiting networked services.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice
orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls
that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for
these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self
optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we
introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a
base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical
Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

*Matteo Cercola,Michele Lomuscio,Dario Piga,Simone Formentin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sensor-guided, regularized extension of GLISp for integrating sensor data with preference-based optimization, showing improved convergence and final outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of existing preference-based optimization methods by incorporating sensor data for improved calibration processes.

Method: The paper proposes combining subjective feedback with sensor data using physics-informed hypothesis functions and least-squares regularization, extending GLISp with grey-box characteristics.

Result: Numerical evaluations demonstrate the proposed method's faster convergence and superior performance in human-in-the-loop vehicle suspension tuning tasks compared to baseline GLISp.

Conclusion: Integrating sensor measurements into preference-learning enhances optimization outcomes, offering a superior alternative to conventional black-box approaches in calibration tasks.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

*Vaibhav Singh,Eugene Belilovsky,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies grokking in low-data and evolving distribution settings, showing the efficiency of Knowledge Distillation (KD) in inducing and accelerating generalization across distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of delayed generalization following overfitting in low-data regimes and distribution shifts, and explore methods to improve adaptability.

Method: The researchers use Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques to transfer knowledge from grokked models across distributions and study joint distribution training and continual pretraining settings.

Result: KD improves generalization, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and enables learning in low data settings by transferring knowledge from models grokked under different distributions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of KD in addressing challenges of grokking, facilitating effective knowledge transfer, and achieving strong performance in scarce data and shifting distribution scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

### [138] [Causal Structure and Representation Learning with Biomedical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04790)
*Caroline Uhler,Jiaqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the fusion of representation learning and causal inference to improve understanding and decision-making in complex, biomedical scenarios using multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is that while representation learning has been key for predictive tasks, it struggles with causal tasks, such as understanding perturbation effects. The motivation stems from combining representation learning with causal inference, leveraging the availability of multi-modal data.

Method: The paper proposes a statistical and computational framework that bridges representation learning and causal inference. This involves integrating observational and perturbational data, and addressing questions related to causal discovery, multi-modal causal variable learning, and optimal perturbation design.

Result: The framework provides guidelines for effectively utilizing multi-modal data to uncover causal relationships and informs intervention designs in various levels, from single-cell to organism-level data.

Conclusion: By merging representation learning with causal inference, the approach offers the potential to address key biomedical challenges and improve causal understanding using the diverse perspectives offered by multi-modal data.

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiTect, an open-source machine learning tool, effectively detects RBD from actigraphy data, showing high accuracy across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a reliable method for screening isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) using wearable devices as iRBD is a key early indicator of neurodegenerative diseases.

Method: The researchers developed a robust machine learning pipeline, including preprocessing and automatic sleep-wake detection, to analyze actigraphy data and extract motion features.

Result: ActiTect exhibited high generalization and performance with AUROC values ranging from 0.84 to 0.95 across internal, blinded, and external datasets.

Conclusion: ActiTect is a promising tool for large-scale RBD screening with wearable devices and promotes collaborative improvements through its open-source nature.

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

*Xiaoda Wang,Yuji Zhao,Kaiqiao Han,Xiao Luo,Sanne van Rooij,Jennifer Stevens,Lifang He,Liang Zhan,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNODE, a Conditional Neural ODE framework that forecasts Parkinson's disease progression by modeling individual brain morphometry trajectories while addressing challenges such as irregular and sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for modeling PD progression have limitations in handling irregular MRI data and accounting for individual patient differences such as symptom severity and progression rate.

Method: The proposed CNODE model uses neural ODEs to represent continuous morphological changes and incorporates patient-specific initial time and progression speed to align individual trajectories.

Result: CNODE was tested on the PPMI dataset and demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

Conclusion: The CNODE framework is effective for continuous and individualized forecasting of PD progression, advancing mechanistic understanding and personalized treatment design.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

*Lunjia Hu,Haipeng Luo,Spandan Senapati,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances fairness in predictions by generalizing multicalibration methods to broader hypothesis classes, introducing swap multicalibration, and proposing an efficient algorithm with superior error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in multicalibration for arbitrary properties and improve prediction fairness by expanding its applicability and efficiency.

Method: The authors generalize multicalibration to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes, introduce swap multicalibration, and develop an oracle-efficient algorithm leveraging sequential Rademacher complexity and online agnostic learners.

Result: The algorithm achieves superior error bounds ($T^{1/(r+1)}$ for $r\ge2$), specifically $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap multicalibration error, resolving an open question in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: This work advances algorithmic fairness by improving multicalibration frameworks, providing efficient solutions, and fully addressing a key open challenge.

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

*Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Hossein Entezari Zarch,Daniel Wong,Murali Annavaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuetServe is a GPU-based LLM serving framework that dynamically adjusts resources for optimal throughput and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving methods struggle to balance high throughput and strict latency SLOs across distinct inference phases due to resource interference or inefficiencies in disaggregated setups.

Method: DuetServe dynamically activates SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing and fine-grained SM partitioning when contention arises, using an attention-aware roofline model, a partitioning optimizer, and an interruption-free execution engine.

Result: DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3 times while maintaining low latency compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: DuetServe provides efficient phase isolation in GPU systems, optimizing throughput and meeting latency SLOs without requiring disaggregation across GPUs.

Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict
latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill
and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both
phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode
phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two
phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated
models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving
framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU.
DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates
SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key
idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through
fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when
contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe
integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency,
(2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize
throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine
that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that
DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low
generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

### [143] [Scaling Up ROC-Optimizing Support Vector Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04979)
*Gimun Bae,Seung Jun Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable variant of the ROC-SVM, reducing computational complexity while maintaining comparable AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost of the ROC-SVM in class-imbalanced binary classification while maintaining its effectiveness.

Method: The authors employ incomplete U-statistics and low-rank kernel approximations to create a scalable and efficient version of the ROC-SVM.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM but with much faster training across both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The scalable ROC-SVM is both efficient and effective, making it a practical tool for class-imbalanced problems with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a new framework for predictive modeling that provides local, smooth, and efficient predictions using learned simplicial meshes and Bernstein-Bezier polynomials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive models with geometric locality, smoothness, interpretability, and latency, addressing issues in dense MLPs and edge-spline networks through a theoretically grounded approach.

Method: SiFEN uses simplicial meshes, barycentric coordinates, Bernstein-Bezier polynomials, and an invertible warp for prediction. It incorporates shape regularization, differentiable edge flips, and semi-discrete optimal transport during training.

Result: The proposed SiFEN achieves favorable performance compared to MLPs and KANs in approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and compact CNN settings. It demonstrates better calibration, lower latency, and competitive approximation rates.

Conclusion: SiFEN emerges as an efficient, interpretable, and theoretically sound alternative to existing neural network models, offering advantages in locality and smoothness while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial
predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field
on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency
due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and
edge-spline networks.

*Kamil Ciosek,Nicolò Felicioni,Juan Elenter Litwin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training method using approximate predicted gradients to reduce costs, validated on a vision transformer task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of neural network training by avoiding full gradient computation.

Method: Utilizing approximate predicted gradients combined with a control-variate-based technique for unbiased gradient estimation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated effectiveness on a vision transformer classification task.

Conclusion: This approach offers a cost-efficient neural network training alternative while maintaining gradient accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a new way of training neural networks, with the goal of reducing
training cost. Our method uses approximate predicted gradients instead of the
full gradients that require an expensive backward pass. We derive a
control-variate-based technique that ensures our updates are unbiased estimates
of the true gradient. Moreover, we propose a novel way to derive a predictor
for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We
empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer
classification task.

### [146] [PuzzleMoE: Efficient Compression of Large Mixture-of-Experts Models via Sparse Expert Merging and Bit-packed inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04805)
*Yushu Zhao,Zheng Wang,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PuzzleMoE introduces a training-free method for compressing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models, reducing memory overhead while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of high memory overhead in scaling MoE models, which limits their widespread deployment despite their efficiency in activating subsets of experts per input.

Method: The authors propose PuzzleMoE, which compresses MoE models by identifying redundancies in element-wise weights and applying sparse merging using a dual-mask approach. Additionally, they introduce a bit-packed encoding scheme to optimize GPU inference.

Result: PuzzleMoE demonstrated up to 50% compression while maintaining high accuracy across tasks, with a performance improvement of up to 16.7% over previous methods on MMLU and achieving a 1.28× inference speedup.

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE offers an innovative and efficient solution for MoE model compression, paving the way for broader adoption by addressing memory and inference bottlenecks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the topological limitations and capabilities of autoencoders when applied to data manifolds and their utilization in dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical constraints and possibilities of autoencoders when applied to data manifolds and dynamical systems.

Method: Explores the mathematical relationship between encoders and decoders to evaluate their ability to preserve manifold topology and adapt to dynamical systems.

Result: Highlights topological constraints on autoencoders and identifies properties relevant to autoencoding invariant manifolds in dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Provides insights into the theoretical operation of autoencoders and their use in preserving the structure and behavior of data manifolds in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space"
$\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an
"encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon
\mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is
as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present
various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an
autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems
having $M$ as an invariant manifold.

*Raymond Fan,Bryce Sandlund,Lin Myat Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses how large datasets influence deep learning, affecting generalization and the geometry of loss minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the role of large datasets in deep learning, especially in how they influence generalization and the nature of loss minima for models.

Method: Minima volumes were measured under varying training data sizes, analyzing how the loss landscape and minima properties evolve with increasing data.

Result: Findings reveal that sharp minima with good generalization exist but are usually not found due to their small volumes; increasing data makes these small generalizing minima relatively larger and thus more accessible.

Conclusion: Large datasets transform the loss landscape, helping deep learning models generalize better by making formerly inaccessible generalizing minima more reachable.

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

*Yiting He,Zhishuai Liu,Weixin Wang,Pan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies online exploration challenges in off-dynamics RL using RMDPs, proposing a novel quantity for measuring dynamics mismatch and introducing a computationally efficient algorithm with sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the realistic challenge of online exploration in RMDPs where deployment and training dynamics differ, without relying on pre-collected datasets or generative models.

Method: The authors introduce the supremal visitation ratio to quantify dynamics mismatch and develop an efficient algorithm with optimal dependence on this measure and the number of interaction episodes.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs and theoretical results are validated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Online learning in RMDPs is exponentially hard when supremal visitation ratio is unbounded, but the proposed approach optimally addresses this challenge.

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in fragmented datasets, inconsistent annotations, and lack of benchmarks hindering antimicrobial peptide discovery.

Method: The authors developed ESCAPE integrating over 80,000 peptides, classifying them based on functional annotations into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, and designed a transformer-based model for functional activity prediction.

Result: Their model demonstrated up to a 2.56% relative improvement in mean Average Precision compared to other methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for peptide classification.

Conclusion: ESCAPE and the proposed model advance computational approaches in antimicrobial peptide research, offering a comprehensive and reproducible framework for future AI-driven studies.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat
antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent
annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational
approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these
challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial
Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000
peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial
peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations
into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on
ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average
Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new
state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a
comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synapse, a novel framework that leverages multiple pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) for more accurate time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address variability in performance among pre-trained TSFMs across different settings by developing a way to leverage their diverse predictive capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes an arbitration framework called Synapse, which dynamically adjusts forecast weights and creates distributions from the quantiles of different TSFM outputs based on context-dependent performance.

Result: Synapse consistently outperforms traditional ensembling methods and individual TSFMs in experimental evaluations, showcasing its superiority in forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: By effectively utilizing complementary strengths of existing TSFMs, Synapse proves to be a robust and context-aware forecasting framework for diverse time series settings.

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance methods for network classification in neuroscience, focusing on epilepsy detection using directed graph analysis.

Method: PRH, which simplifies persistent filtration using condensed digraphs, is utilized and compared with DPH. Support vector machines are employed alongside topological features like Betti curves and their integrals.

Result: PRH demonstrated superior classification performance over DPH in detecting epilepsy from network data.

Conclusion: Persistent reachability homology is effective for network classification tasks in neuroscience, particularly epilepsy detection, offering computational advantages over traditional approaches.

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of
digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study
the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience
problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

*Maojiang Su,Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu,Sophia Pi,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a non-asymptotic bound for KL divergence in flow-matching approximations, showing efficiency comparable to diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the theoretical understanding of flow-matching methods and demonstrate their statistical efficiency in approximating smooth distributions.

Method: The paper derives deterministic bounds on KL divergence using $L_2$ flow-matching loss and connects these bounds to the TV distance for statistical convergence rates.

Result: The paper shows flow-matching approaches achieve near minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions and validates this through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Flow matching methods achieve comparable efficiency with diffusion models, supporting their practical viability with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses harmful content in text-to-image generative models and proposes integrating implicit negative embeddings from concept inversion to improve defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over harmful outputs from generative models provided with malicious prompts drive the need for robust defense mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose replacing negative prompts in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings through concept inversion.

Result: The method consistently improves defense success rates on nudity and violence benchmarks without altering the input semantic quality.

Conclusion: Integrating implicit negative embeddings enhances defense methods without modifying existing pipelines, offering a robust and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

*Brenda Nogueira,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Nuno Moniz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Molecular property prediction suffers from underperformance in sparse regions with critical compounds. SPECTRA tackles this by augmenting molecular graphs in the spectral domain, improving performance on underrepresented cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Graph Neural Networks fail to perform well in predicting sparse yet critical compound properties due to optimization for average error. Existing oversampling methods distort molecular structure, making precise predictions difficult.

Method: The SPECTRA framework reconstructs molecular graphs from SMILES, aligns node correspondence using Gromov-Wasserstein couplings, interpolates eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and node features, and reconstructs edges to synthesize molecular graphs in the spectral domain. It employs a rarity-aware data augmentation budgeting to focus on scarce data regions.

Result: SPECTRA significantly improves prediction errors in sparse target ranges while maintaining competitive global accuracy. It generates realistic and interpretable synthetic molecules reflecting spectral geometry.

Conclusion: Spectral, geometry-aware graph augmentation using SPECTRA efficiently addresses imbalance in molecular property prediction, improving critical target predictions and providing insightful synthetic molecular data.

Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high
potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on
these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often
distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral
Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular
graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute
molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates
Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;
and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates
with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a
kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are
scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,
SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.
On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges
while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic
molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our
results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective
and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDRaM, a novel denoising diffusion method based on randomized midpoint approximation that requires fewer computations ($\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ complexity) for sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior DDPM analyses had higher complexity bounds and focused on Euler discretization. Researchers sought a computationally efficient algorithm inspired by log-concave sampling efforts.

Method: The authors present DDRaM, which employs a randomized midpoint approach to approximate SDEs better and demonstrates advantages using the shifted composition rule.

Result: They derive sublinear computational complexity ($\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$) for sampling using DDRaM and experimentally validate its efficacy with pre-trained image synthesis models.

Conclusion: DDRaM provides computational benefits for DDPM-based sampling while maintaining practical high-performance generation capabilities.

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

Motivation: The study aims to understand how transportation attributes influence consumer behavior in food purchasing and propose innovative certifications to improve the food supply chain in the U.S.

Method: A machine learning model was utilized in a preference experiment incorporating various transportation certificates and product-specific factors, based on prior research on supply chain traceability and consumer demand.

Result: Consumers showed a strong preference for safety and energy source certificates in food transportation, highlighting key decision-making factors in purchasing choices.

Conclusion: This paper provides data-driven recommendations to enhance the U.S. food supply chain, emphasizing the significant role of transportation-related certificates in consumer decisions.

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in adapting LLMs to novel environments by introducing two strategies: online distributional adaptation and deployment-time dynamics grounding, demonstrating improved performance in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve LLM agents' inability to generalize to novel environments due to mismatches between pre-training and test conditions.

Method: Two strategies are proposed: (1) online distributional adaptation for aligning with environmental response formats and (2) dynamics grounding for learning environment causal dynamics via exploration.

Result: Both strategies enhance performance across benchmarks, especially dynamics grounding in complex environments, boosting WebArena success rate from 2% to 23%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods facilitate generalization in LLM agents, confirming their efficacy in adapting to novel and complex environments with low computational cost.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

TL;DR: SigmaDock introduces a novel method for molecular docking combining rigid-body fragment decomposition with a SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving ligand binding pose determination by addressing issues like chemically implausible outputs and high computational costs in existing generative approaches.

Method: Utilizes a fragmentation scheme to decompose ligands into rigid bodies, combined with a SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model to predict ligand poses within binding pockets.

Result: Achieved Top-1 success rates above 79.9% on PoseBusters, outperforming recent deep learning methods (12.7-30.8%) and surpassing classical physics-based docking.

Conclusion: SigmaDock overcomes prior challenges, setting a new benchmark in molecular docking reliability and feasibility with deep learning techniques.

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in continuous-action reinforcement learning by improving model expressiveness, reducing qubit requirements, and addressing instability in continuous control.

Method: The authors propose using CSQBMs with exponential-family priors and quantum Boltzmann distributions, allowing analytical gradient computation for integration with Actor-Critic and continuous Q-learning frameworks.

Result: CSQBMs enable efficient sampling, reduce instability in continuous control, and maintain strong expressiveness while requiring fewer qubits.

Conclusion: CSQBMs offer a promising approach for integrating quantum and classical models in reinforcement learning, tackling challenges in continuous-action scenarios effectively.

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

Result: FoodRL consistently achieved better performance than baseline models, particularly during disruptive events, enabling redistribution of food equivalent to 1.7 million additional meals annually.

Conclusion: FoodRL demonstrates a significant potential for improving forecasting in humanitarian supply chains, addressing challenges of volatility and concept drift in donation patterns.

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

### [162] [Self-Interest and Systemic Benefits: Emergence of Collective Rationality in Mixed Autonomy Traffic Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04883)
*Di Chen,Jia Li,Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the possibility of achieving collective rationality (CR) in mixed-autonomy traffic systems, where self-interested autonomous and human-driven vehicles coexist, using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether self-interested autonomous vehicles (AVs) can provide benefits to all agents in mixed-autonomy traffic systems without directly optimizing for system-level objectives.

Method: The study incorporates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) trained driving agents with a reward design to assess the emergence and robustness of collective rationality (CR) in traffic systems.

Result: Results demonstrate that CR consistently emerges in varying scenarios, showcasing the reliability and robustness of this phenomenon, and presents a mechanism explaining this emergence based on simulation evidence.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that advanced learning methods like federated learning could be used to achieve collective cooperation among self-driven agents, benefiting mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

### [163] [Multi-agent Coordination via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005)
*Dongsu Lee,Daehee Lee,Amy Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAC-Flow is a framework for multi-agent coordination, balancing computational speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome trade-offs in multi-agent coordination frameworks between computational efficiency and complex behavior representation.

Method: MAC-Flow learns flow-based representation of joint behaviors and distills them into decentralized one-step policies.

Result: MAC-Flow achieves 14.5x faster inference compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining good coordination performance.

Conclusion: MAC-Flow successfully balances performance and efficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks.

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

*Shuvendu Roy,Hossein Hajimirsadeghi,Mengyao Zhai,Golnoosh Samei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study assesses the effectiveness and limitations of label-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods across various model sizes, proposing curriculum learning and data curation to improve weaker models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the generalizability of unsupervised RL methods to smaller base models with limited reasoning ability, addressing critical gaps in escalating reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained models.

Method: The study systematically evaluates label-free RL performance across different model scales (0.5B to 7B parameters) and reasoning strengths, introducing curriculum learning and masking no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, it develops a data curation pipeline for generating training samples with predefined difficulty.

Result: Empirical analysis highlights challenges in smaller base models for label-free RL, including limited reasoning capability and difficulty generating diverse chains of thought. The proposed methods yield consistent improvements in RL performance for all tested model sizes.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that curriculum learning coupled with enhanced data curation can effectively overcome challenges in unsupervised RL for smaller models, setting a foundation for future research in reasoning capability enhancement in resource-constrained AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop benchmarks to better evaluate and address challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), focusing on long-term dependencies, exploration, credit assignment, and cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL benchmarks often fail to adequately test long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities of multi-agent systems, limiting progress in the field.

Method: The authors created the Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop environments, with Craftax-MA being fast for training multiple agents, and Craftax-Coop adding heterogeneous agents and complexities like trading to challenge cooperation capabilities.

Result: Analysis shows that current MARL algorithms struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, exploration, and cooperation tasks in these benchmarks.

Conclusion: Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop have the potential to be pivotal benchmarks, driving meaningful research advancements in MARL through robust evaluations of fundamental challenges.

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAD-Flower enhances flow matching methods for planning tasks by addressing safety, admissibility, and dynamical consistency through an augmented flow approach with formal guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching methods lack guarantees for state/action constraints and dynamical consistency, which are essential for trajectory safety and executability.

Method: The paper proposes augmenting flow matching with virtual control inputs and nonlinear control theory to ensure constraints without retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate SAD-Flower’s superior performance in constraint satisfaction compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SAD-Flower provides a reliable framework for safety and dynamic consistency in trajectory planning without requiring retraining, addressing critical shortcomings in prior methods.

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

### [167] [A Dual Perspective on Decision-Focused Learning: Scalable Training via Dual-Guided Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04909)
*Paula Rodriguez-Diaz,Kirk Bansak Elisabeth Paulson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a scalable method to optimize decision-focused learning under uncertainty, reducing dependence on frequent solver calls while maintaining decision alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses scaling challenges in decision-focused learning for optimization under uncertainty, where state-of-the-art methods heavily rely on computationally expensive solvers.

Method: The proposed methodology, Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), leverages dual variables to shape learning, trains periodically with reduced dependence on solvers, and utilizes simple surrogate losses for intermediate training steps.

Result: DGL shows asymptotically diminishing decision regret and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solver usage and training time while matching or exceeding their performance.

Conclusion: DGL is a promising scalable approach for solving combinatorial selection problems efficiently, demonstrating significant computational advantages while preserving decision quality.

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

### [169] [Leak@$k$: Unlearning Does Not Make LLMs Forget Under Probabilistic Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04934)
*Hadi Reisizadeh,Jiajun Ruan,Yiwei Chen,Soumyadeep Pal,Sijia Liu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) fail to achieve consistent forgetting, as sensitive information often resurfaces during probabilistic sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure LLMs comply with regulations and ethical guidelines by effectively unlearning sensitive, private, or harmful content.

Method: The authors introduce a new evaluation metric called 'leak@$k$' to measure the likelihood of forgotten information resurfacing under probabilistic decoding strategies.

Result: The study, conducted using benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, reveals that current state-of-the-art unlearning techniques are unreliable and prone to leaking sensitive information.

Conclusion: Existing techniques for unlearning in LLMs are insufficient, requiring more robust methods to ensure reliable forgetting.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR), deriving update expressions and analyzing trajectories and convergence guarantees under settings of unknown parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of EM algorithm's behavior in 2MLR problems with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters, motivating deeper exploration into its structural properties, convergence, and trajectory.

Method: The paper employs mathematical derivations, trajectory-based analysis, and angles-based convergence characterization to analyze EM update expressions and trajectories in various signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

Result: Explicit EM update expressions are derived for all SNR regimes, with convergence characterized as linear or quadratic depending on the initialization angle relative to the ground truth. Non-asymptotic statistical guarantees are established for finite-sample scenarios.

Conclusion: This trajectory-based framework enhances understanding of the EM algorithm for 2MLR, providing insights on its accuracy, convergence behavior, and structural properties across noiseless and noisy regimes.

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FAR-TS, a fast and flexible generative model for multivariate time series synthesis, solving limitations of diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based generative models for multivariate time series are slow and restricted to fixed-length windows, limiting their effectiveness for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed FAR-TS framework uses disentangled factorization to separate static cross-channel correlations and temporal coefficients, which are vector-quantized into discrete tokens. An autoregressive LLaMA-style Transformer is then applied to model these tokens, enabling fast generation of arbitrary-length sequences.

Result: FAR-TS is significantly faster than Diffusion-TS and maintains high-quality synthesis, preserving cross-channel correlations and interpretable latent spaces.

Conclusion: FAR-TS offers efficient and controllable generation of multivariate time series, representing an advance in time series generation with improved flexibility and speed.

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

TL;DR: The paper explores progressive training via model depth expansion, optimizing for computational efficiency while achieving comparable results to fully trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models deliver higher accuracy but require significant computational resources, necessitating efficient training strategies.

Method: Investigates depth expansion through optimization and feature learning, proposing a zero/one-layer progressive training method.

Result: Zero/one-layer progressive training saves approximately 80% computation or accelerates training by 5 times on GPT2 while nearly matching the performance of fully trained models.

Conclusion: Progressive training effectively balances computational cost and performance, providing valuable guidance for scalable deep learning models.

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven drug design strategies often ignore the role of protein-peptide interactions, leading to subpar molecule designs.

Method: Introduced Peptide2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network trained on large datasets to model peptide-protein binding and generate small molecules.

Result: Peptide2Mol demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks, producing molecules with resemblance to peptide binders and enabling optimization.

Conclusion: Peptide2Mol is a promising approach for advanced structure-based drug design, utilizing protein-peptide interactions to create optimized bioactive compounds.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design has seen significant advancements with the
integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the generation of
hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the
importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result
in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an
E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small
molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their
surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and
leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also
produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder.
Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic
design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol
as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive

Conclusion: Integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning improves the accuracy and interpretability of carbon price predictions for nonstationary financial time series.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

*Daniel S. Lee,Mayra S. Haedo-Cruz,Chen Jiang,Oshin Miranda,LiRong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiPETE is a transformer-based model for disease risk prediction from EHR, improving precision-recall by up to 50% for predicting alcohol and substance use disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the promise of transformer models in disease risk prediction, modeling temporal dependencies in irregular EHR data remains a challenge.

Method: Introduces BiPETE, a dual positional embedding transformer with rotary and sinusoidal embeddings tailored to EHR data, trained on two mental health cohorts without large-scale pretraining.

Result: Achieved a significant improvement (up to 50%) in AUPRC compared to baseline models. Additionally, the framework identifies clinical features linked to ASUD risk.

Conclusion: BiPETE offers strong performance and interpretability for disease risk prediction, presenting clinical insights that can support risk mitigation.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

### [178] [OvA-LP: A Simple and Efficient Framework for Federated Learning on Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05028)
*Dongjin Park,Hasung Yeo,Joon-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces OvA-LP, a federated learning framework designed to suppress local drift in federated fine-tuning (FFT) under highly heterogeneous client distributions, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated fine-tuning is hindered by the challenge of local drift caused by heterogeneous client data, leading to systematic biases and poor accuracy. Existing methods to correct for drift often fail under extreme non-IID conditions, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The authors propose OvA-LP, a framework using a frozen encoder with one-vs-all heads and a two-stage procedure. It preserves feature geometry and decouples logits to prevent drift amplification. The method leverages a precomputing step to make per-round computations nearly encoder size-independent.

Result: OvA-LP achieves significantly better performance under non-IID conditions on CIFAR-100, retaining 95.9% IID accuracy, compared to only 10.1% for PFPT and 34.5% for FFT-MoE. It also demonstrates resilience to label noise and optimizes computational efficiency.

Conclusion: OvA-LP offers an efficient and robust solution for federated fine-tuning in heterogeneous environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining resilience to challenging conditions such as extreme data heterogeneity and label noise.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing programs for board games is time-intensive. The authors aim to explore whether LLMs can automate and simplify this process by generating game code from simple inputs.

Method: The researchers test three LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) on their ability to create code for different board games and their modified versions.

Result: The comparative capabilities of the three LLMs are analyzed and assessed based on their efficiency in generating board game-related code.

new variants of existing games.

*Felix Divo,Maurice Kraus,Anh Q. Nguyen,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Flora D. Salim,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuAnTS, a dataset designed for question answering on time series data, specifically human motion skeleton trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on question answering for time series data compared to vision and text, enabling improved model interaction and decision-making.

Method: Developing the QuAnTS dataset, conducting experiments to evaluate its composition and effectiveness, and proposing baselines while comparing human and model performances.

Result: QuAnTS was found to be a large-scale, well-formed, and comprehensive dataset for time series QA based on evaluations.

Conclusion: The dataset and research lay foundational work for further interactions with time series models via text, aiming to improve decision-making and system transparency.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

*Aras Erarslan,Carlos Sevilla Salcedo,Ville Tanskanen,Anni Nisov,Eero Päiväkumpu,Heikki Aisala,Kaisu Honkapää,Arto Klami,Petrus Mikkola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization (CPBO) to optimize objectives under constraints of high production costs and perceptual ambiguity while using minimal comparative evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in preference-based optimization ignore the production costs of generating solutions and overlook perceptual ambiguities in expert feedback.

Method: The authors expanded preference-based optimization by incorporating production cost constraints and perceptual ambiguity into the probabilistic preference model, coupled with a tailored information-theoretic acquisition strategy.

Result: The proposed CPBO method demonstrated improved accuracy under conditions of high production costs or indifference feedback.

Conclusion: Accounting for both production cost and perceptual ambiguity significantly enhances the performance of preference-based optimization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates methods to predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with PRRT. A multimodal deep learning model combining imaging and lab data achieved the best accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The objective is to enhance personalized treatment by accurately predicting PFS for patients undergoing PRRT, improving long-term outcomes.

Method: The study trained seven models, including unimodal and multimodal deep learning approaches, using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data such as SR-PET/CT from a single-center cohort of 116 patients.

Result: The multimodal model using laboratory biomarkers, SR-PET, and CT data achieved the best performance (AUROC: 0.72, AUPRC: 0.80), outperforming unimodal models.

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning shows promise for more accurate PFS prediction in PRRT-treated NET patients, potentially enabling better-tailored follow-up strategies.

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

*Davide Marincione,Donato Crisostomi,Roberto Dessi,Emanuele Rodolà,Emanuele Rossi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the improvements in bioacoustic foundation models using NatureLM, addressing trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility through model merging, leading to improved generalization and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance foundation models in bioacoustics, enabling generalization across species and tasks while resolving flexibility trade-offs in instruction-following.

Method: The authors utilize a model merging strategy, interpolating NatureLM with its base language model, to balance domain expertise and instruction-following flexibility.

Result: The merged model achieves improved instruction-following capabilities and over a 200% improvement in zero-shot generalization, setting new benchmarks in unseen species classification.

Conclusion: Merging NatureLM with its base model resolves its trade-offs in flexibility while enhancing its generalization performance and state-of-the-art results in bioacoustic tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

*Mathias Lundteigen Mohus,Jingyue Li,Zhirong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel data poisoning method called associative poisoning, which manipulates generative models' statistical features stealthily without training control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of generative models like Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT to data poisoning attacks, especially in real-world scenarios where the attacker lacks control over the training process.

Method: The proposed technique, associative poisoning, manipulates data by perturbing training data to influence statistical associations between features in generated outputs, without altering overall quality or detectability. A formal mathematical formulation and theoretical proof of feasibility are provided.

Result: Empirical results on state-of-the-art generative models show successful manipulation of feature associations while maintaining the quality of outputs, avoiding visual detection.

Conclusion: This research highlights the susceptibility of generative systems to subtle data manipulations, identifies defensive limitations, and proposes new countermeasures to enhance system security.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of spatial sensor density and sampling frequency on various forecasting models using environmental sensor data, highlighting distinct performance patterns across model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of understanding regarding how changes in spatial sensor density and sampling intervals influence forecasting model performance in IoT environmental sensing.

Method: The study conducts a systematic evaluation of different forecasting models (VAR, GRU, Transformer, STGNNs, TSFMs) under varying spatial sensor densities and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data.

Result: Findings reveal that STGNNs perform effectively with sparse sensor deployments and moderate sampling rates, while TSFMs excel at high frequencies but falter with reduced spatial coverage. The multivariate TSFM Moirai emerges as the top-performing model by learning cross-sensor dependencies.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable insights for optimizing forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems and encourages reproducibility through open-sourced code and data.

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All

TL;DR: The paper addresses computational challenges in using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for counterfactual reasoning, introducing a novel diffusion-based framework that resolves structural errors and enhances causal accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual reasoning in Structural Causal Models (SCMs) requires precise inference of latent variables, a process hindered by computational challenges in complex scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces BELM-MDCM, a diffusion-based framework that eliminates Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE) using an analytically invertible mechanism. It incorporates Targeted Modeling and a Hybrid Training Objective to instill causal accuracy.

Result: The Zero-SRE framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables high-fidelity counterfactual analysis at individual levels, validating the approach with rigorous experiments.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new standard in combining generative models with structural causal theory, providing a blueprint for advancing counterfactual reasoning using modern computational methods.

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning model to solve the TSP-D problem for truck-drone collaborative logistics, achieving competitive solutions with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of TSP-D, which involve achieving operational efficiencies in truck-drone collaborations while managing the computational complexity of NP-hard problems.

Method: A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework combining a Transformer-inspired encoder with a k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism and a Minimal Gated Unit decoder under an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.

Result: The proposed model generates competitive or superior solutions on TSP-D benchmark instances (N=10 to 100) in less computation time than heuristic algorithms and reinforcement learning methods, with significantly reduced training time and better performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness in solving TSP-D, offering improvements in both solution quality and training time compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety and effectiveness of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects by improving subsurface heterogeneity characterization and data assimilation reliability.

Method: A machine learning-enhanced localization framework is developed, combining score-based diffusion models and large ensembles with permeability data, processed by ML algorithms, to enhance covariance estimation using the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA).

Result: The proposed framework improved ensemble variance retention while achieving data-matching quality similar to non-localization methods in CO$_2$ injection scenarios.

Conclusion: The ML-enhanced localization framework provides reliable uncertainty quantification for geological carbon storage projects, facilitating better risk assessment during implementation.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how data augmentation can improve privacy and predictive accuracy in time series forecasting with Electronic Health Records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safeguarding sensitive EHRs from Membership Inference Attacks while maintaining strong predictive abilities in time series forecasting.

Method: The study evaluates three augmentation strategies: Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), ZOO with PCA constraints (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp to mitigate MIAs.

Result: ZOO-PCA was found to be most effective in reducing MIA true-positive/false-positive ratios, while retaining high predictive performance on test data.

Conclusion: ZOO-PCA offers a promising balance between privacy protection and predictive accuracy in sensitive healthcare data applications.

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

TL;DR: Efficient transformer model, Compress & Attend Transformer (CAT), achieves better trade-offs between compute efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers imposes memory and computational challenges, requiring solutions to balance efficiency with in-context recall performance.

Method: The CAT model employs dense attention and compression to decode sequences. Training with various chunk sizes enables adaptive control of quality-compute tradeoff at test time.

Result: CAT surpasses efficient transformer baselines and matches dense transformer performance in language modeling while being faster and more memory-efficient.

Conclusion: CAT effectively balances efficiency and quality, providing adaptability and improved performance across compute-memory budgets.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

### [191] [APP: Accelerated Path Patching with Task-Specific Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05442)
*Frauke Andersen,William Rudman,Ruochen Zhang,Carsten Eickhoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid method combining pruning and circuit discovery to make circuit analysis faster and computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circuit discovery methods are computationally demanding and limited in their effectiveness for smaller models. There is a need for faster and more effective ways to analyze circuits in interpretability pipelines.

Method: The authors propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), which integrates a novel pruning approach called Contrastive-FLAP. This method leverages causal mediation analysis to prioritize task-specific attention heads, followed by applying Path Patching to further refine the circuit analysis.

Result: APP reduces the search space for circuit discovery methods by an average of 56%, and speeds up traditional Path Patching by 59.63%-93.27%. The obtained circuits show significant overlap and similar performance compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: APP provides a faster and computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods while maintaining the quality of circuit analysis and interpretability results.

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

*Janet Jenq,Hongda Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of typographic attacks in vision-language models and proposes rendering relevant textual content onto product images to strengthen multimodal product retrieval systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models in e-commerce face vulnerabilities to typographic attacks, compromising search relevance.

Method: The method involves overlaying relevant textual information directly onto images for improved vision-text alignment and multimodal retrieval.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates enhanced unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across three e-commerce datasets and six model families.

Conclusion: Rendering textual metadata on product images is an effective strategy for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce platforms.

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a Bayesian framework for dynamics learning using non-conservative Hamiltonian Gaussian Processes from input-output data, avoiding reliance on rare momentum data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build physically consistent models from limited data efficiently while adhering to physical laws to improve tasks like model-based control.

Method: The approach embeds Hamiltonian dynamics in Gaussian Processes using a Bayesian scheme. It estimates probabilities of hidden states and structural parameters, leveraging reduced-rank GP approximations for computational efficiency.

Result: The method is demonstrated through a nonlinear simulation case study and shows improved performance over existing approaches dependent on momentum data.

Conclusion: Non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs enable data-efficient and physically consistent dynamics modeling from input-output data, offering computational advantages.

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and versatility of electromagnetic inverse design to overcome the limitations of expensive and slow iterative optimization methods.

Method: A conditional diffusion model based on a 1D U-Net with Feature-wise Linear Modulation, trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, to predict valid structured media geometries from scattering cross-section profiles.

Result: The model shows a median MPE below 19% on unseen targets, with the best performance at 1.39%, beating evolutionary optimization methods and reducing design time to seconds.

Conclusion: Diffusion models hold great promise for advancing electromagnetic inverse design, enabling rapid exploration and development in photonic and wireless communication systems.

Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design

scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization.
Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map
desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure,
naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse
valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves
median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES
evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds.
These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for
advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid

*Emad Efatinasab,Nahal Azadi,Davide Dalle Pezze,Gian Antonio Susto,Chuadhry Mujeeb Ahmed,Mirco Rampazzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Continual Learning (CL) framework to address evolving fault prediction challenges in smart grids. ProDER, a novel approach, shows superior performance in adapting to evolving conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for accurate fault prediction in smart grids due to evolving environments and challenges where models must adapt to new faults and zones.

Method: The paper proposes Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay (ProDER), which combines prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and prototype-guided replay memory within realistic learning scenarios.

Result: ProDER exhibited a minor accuracy drop of only 0.045 for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction, outperforming other continual learning techniques.

Conclusion: Continual Learning (CL) offers a practical solution for robust and scalable fault prediction in smart grids, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of ProDER.

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

TL;DR: The paper studies robust multitask control under adversarial settings and model uncertainties, introducing a clustering-based approach to improve system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of collaboratively learning control policies for multiple systems under adversarial corruption and model uncertainties.

Method: Introduces a clustered multitask approach merging clustering, system identification, and resilient aggregation to handle corrupted model updates.

Result: Analysis shows that certainty-equivalent control regret decreases with the number of honest systems per cluster, and remains robust under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates adversarial impacts and can be used to collaboratively learn robust control policies across multiple systems.

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under
model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask
approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

### [197] [Parameter-Efficient Conditioning for Material Generalization in Graph-Based Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05456)
*Naveen Raj Manoharan,Hassan Iqbal,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parameter-efficient conditioning mechanism to make Graph Network-based Simulators (GNS) adaptive to different material parameters, enabling better generalization for particle-based physics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most GNS models are restricted to single material types, failing to generalize across various constitutive behaviors, which limits their real-world applications. This research aims to solve this limitation and adapt GNS models to diverse material properties.

Method: The study identifies sensitivity to material properties in early message-passing layers, proposes fine-tuning only these layers, and introduces a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to adapt GNS to different materials.

Result: Using the proposed FiLM mechanism, the model achieves accurate long-term rollouts with minimal training data (about 5-fold reduction compared to baseline methods). It successfully interpolates, extrapolates, and resolves inverse design problems.

Conclusion: This mechanism enables GNS models to handle diverse material properties, making them applicable to real-world tasks like inverse design and closed-loop control, thus broadening their engineering utility.

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cluster-based methods for self-supervised learning show promise but rely on heuristics; this drives the need for a robust statistical framework.

Method: Connections are drawn between unsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models to refine methodology and develop SiamMM.

Result: SiamMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised learning benchmarks and provides insights into potential mislabeling in datasets.

Conclusion: Using statistical principles enhances clustering methods, and SiamMM demonstrates improved performance and interpretability for self-supervised learning applications.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering-based
approaches for self-supervised and unsupervised learning. However, the
application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology
remains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these
unsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models from statistics.
Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these
clustering methods, leading to the development of a novel model named SiamMM.
Our method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised
learning benchmarks. Inspection of the learned clusters reveals a strong
resemblance to unseen ground truth labels, uncovering potential instances of
mislabeling.

*Antônio Catão,Melvin Poveda,Leonardo Voltarelli,Paulo Orenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TUPANN is a satellite-based precipitation forecasting model that combines deep learning and physical modeling for skillful, interpretable, and transferable nowcasts in diverse climates, performing well even in regions lacking radar infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve short-term precipitation forecasts in regions without dense weather-radar networks, especially in areas exposed to climate extremes. The goal is to develop a model that is skillful, transferable to different climates, and operational in real-time using satellite imagery alone.

Method: The TUPANN model uses a physics-aligned approach. It employs a variational encoder-decoder to infer motion and intensity fields, a lead-time-conditioned MaxViT to evolve latent states, and a differentiable advection operator to reconstruct future precipitation frames. Supervised learning with satellite data (GOES-16 RRQPE) and optical flow is central to this approach.

Result: TUPANN demonstrates strong forecasting performance across diverse climates, excelling at higher precipitation thresholds. The model achieves either the best or second-best skill when evaluated with CSI and HSS metrics at 10-180 minute lead times. It shows potential for cross-city generalization with minimal degradation and produces interpretable results aligned with numerical optical flow.

Conclusion: TUPANN offers a promising approach for real-time, global, and transferable short-term precipitation forecasts, particularly for regions lacking extensive radar infrastructure. Its physically aligned architecture ensures interpretable and robust nowcasting, which could help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that measures six soil components (M, N, P, K, C, Al) and reduces estimation errors by up to 31.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless soil sensing techniques require recalibration to handle variations in soil texture, affecting their usability and efficiency in precision agriculture.

Method: SoilX uses Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL) with Orthogonality Regularizer and Separation Loss, paired with a tetrahedral antenna array for robust measurement without recalibration.

Result: Extensive experiments show SoilX improves estimation accuracy by 23.8% to 31.5% compared to existing methods, demonstrating reliable performance even in new field conditions.

Conclusion: SoilX offers a practical, calibration-free solution for precise soil monitoring, optimizing agricultural resource usage and yield efficiency.

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting the stability effects of amino acid mutations on enzymes is crucial for advancements in protein engineering and drug design.

Method: The authors propose DGTN, which integrates GNN-derived structural embeddings and transformer representations via a bidirectional diffusion mechanism.

Result: DGTN outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks, achieving Pearson Rho of 0.87 and RMSE of 1.21 kcal/mol, with significant improvement attributed to the diffusion innovation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges structural and sequential protein representations, providing a principled solution for accuracy in predicting enzyme stability in mutations.

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work
establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein
representations through learnable diffusion.

Result: Demonstrates 16-19% throughput improvement, 57-67% energy-delay product reduction versus baseline, and significant speedup and energy reduction compared to alternative methods.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hybrid designs like NeuroFlex outperform single-mode systems in energy efficiency and latency without compromising accuracy, showing potential for practical edge workloads.

Abstract: NeuroFlex is a column-level accelerator that co-executes artificial and
spiking neural networks to minimize energy-delay product on sparse edge
workloads with competitive accuracy. The design extends integer-exact QCFS
ANN-SNN conversion from layers to independent columns. It unifies INT8 storage
with on-the-fly spike generation using an offline cost model to assign columns
to ANN or SNN cores and pack work across processing elements with deterministic
runtime. Our cost-guided scheduling algorithm improves throughput by 16-19%
over random mapping and lowers EDP by 57-67% versus a strong ANN-only baseline
across VGG-16, ResNet-34, GoogLeNet, and BERT models. NeuroFlex also delivers
up to 2.5x speedup over LoAS and 2.51x energy reduction over SparTen. These
results indicate that fine-grained and integer-exact hybridization outperforms
single-mode designs on energy and latency without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: LUT-based binary multi-layer neural networks are effective and feasible for real-time SiPM particle hit processing via FPGA systems.

Abstract: For self-triggered readout of SiPM sum signals, a waveform classification can
aid a simple threshold trigger to reliably extract calorimetric particle hit

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScheduleStream, a general-purpose framework for effective planning and scheduling, enabling parallel arm motion in bimanual robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bimanual robots are advantageous for efficient task execution but computational challenges arise due to their complex hybrid action space. Current TAMP algorithms limit their potential by focusing on single-arm motion.

Method: The authors developed ScheduleStream, which uses hybrid durative actions for asynchronous, parameter-driven temporal dynamics. Domain-independent algorithms and samplers with GPU acceleration are employed.

Result: ScheduleStream algorithms improve efficiency compared to ablations, validated via simulations and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: ScheduleStream enhances TAMP's capabilities by enabling parallel arm motion, offering a significant improvement in scheduling for bimanual robot applications.

Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like
ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However,
controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the
growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce
plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow
for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we
present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &
scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics
using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist
for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose
domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any
application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion
Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers
to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations
in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We
demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The labor-intensive process of constructing simulations limits scalability and validation in robot learning.

Method: ReGen uses large language models to synthesize cause-and-effect graphs from robot behavior, translates them into symbolic programs, and executes them in simulation environments.

Result: ReGen enables more diverse, complex simulations, supports controllable generation for corner cases, and enhances validation of policies with high success rates in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: ReGen advances scalable robot learning by improving the generation and robustness of simulations, supporting broader validation and augmenting datasets/simulations. Code and examples are publicly available.

Abstract: Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating

paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates
simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a

ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the
behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by
expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships,
relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then
translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot
simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based
on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation,
(iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning
with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We
demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks,
generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing
simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for
corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and
supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for
improved generalization and robustness. We provide code and example videos at:

### [206] [Unified Multimodal Diffusion Forcing for Forceful Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04812)
*Zixuan Huang,Huaidian Hou,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents Multimodal Diffusion Forcing (MDF), a framework using diffusion models to learn from multimodal robot trajectories for improved action generation and understanding task outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning approaches often overlook interactions between sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which are essential for modeling robot behavior and achieving task success.

Method: MDF trains a diffusion model using random partial masking to reconstruct trajectories, encouraging it to capture temporal and cross-modal dependencies across sensory inputs, actions, and outcomes.

Result: MDF shows strong performance on forceful manipulation tasks across simulated and real-world environments, achieving versatility and robustness under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: MDF successfully extends the capabilities of imitation learning models by improving their ability to model multimodal dependencies, creating a robust and versatile framework for robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning
approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB
images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay
between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which
is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this
work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning
from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation.
Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking
and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training
objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies,
such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states
from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful
manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show
that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong
performance, and robustness under noisy observations. More visualizations can

TL;DR: Pixi is a package-management framework addressing reproducibility challenges in robotics research by ensuring exact dependency states, resolving dependency issues quickly, and integrating major ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics research faces reproducibility issues due to fragmented toolchains, complex environments, and dependency conflicts, which hinder collaboration and deployment.

Method: Pixi provides a unified package-management framework with project-level lockfiles and a high-performance SAT solver for enhanced dependency resolution, along with integration of existing ecosystems like conda-forge and PyPI.

Result: Pixi achieves up to 10x faster dependency resolution, streamlines setup processes, and has been adopted in over 5,300 projects. It enables bit-for-bit reproducibility across platforms.

Conclusion: Pixi reduces technical barriers, accelerates research in robotics and AI, and fosters reproducible and collaborative infrastructures for scientific computing.

Abstract: The reproducibility crisis in scientific computing constrains robotics
research. Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot
be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment
because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex.
These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software
toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified
package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact
dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit
reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up
to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of
the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers.
Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours
to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling
scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates
progress in robotics and AI.

*Shubham Natraj,Bruno Sinopoli,Yiannis Kantaros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel non-uniform sampling strategy for sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs), leveraging certified regions to improve efficiency and planning speed in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBMPs rely on uniform sampling, which leads to inefficiency and slow planning in complex scenarios.

Method: The approach incorporates certified regions by combining heuristic predictors (e.g., A*) with conformal prediction to create probabilistically guaranteed sampling regions around an initial path.

Result: Evaluations show the method consistently finds feasible paths more quickly and performs better in unseen environments compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances SBMPs with probabilistically correct non-uniform sampling, improving efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used to compute dynamically
feasible robot paths. However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads
to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a
novel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by
biasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by
(i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path
predictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal
prediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty. This process yields
prediction sets around the initial-guess path that are guaranteed, with
user-specified probability, to contain the optimal solution. To our knowledge,
this is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides such
probabilistically correct guarantees on the sampling regions. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently finds feasible paths
faster and generalizes better to unseen environments than existing baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in solar panel operations due to dust and debris by designing cleaning mechanisms and testing protective materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome operational challenges faced by solar panels caused by dust accumulation or impacts from debris, especially for critical applications like space exploration and wildfire monitoring.

Method: Designed and compared two cleaning systems (wiper vs rail systems) and tested various protective materials, focusing on different layering combinations.

Result: Polycarbonate is promising as a protective material if layered with a soft material under hard material. Wiper-based cleaning systems outperform rail-based systems in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and power efficiency.

Conclusion: Wiper systems are more effective for cleaning, and material layering improves protection. These solutions enhance solar panel survivability and functionality in critical applications.

Abstract: Solar energy is used for many mission-critical applications including space
exploration, sensor systems to monitor wildfires, etc. Their operation can be
limited or even terminated if solar panels are covered with dust or hit by
space debris. To address this issue, we designed panel cleaning mechanisms and
tested protective materials. For cleaning mechanisms, we designed and compared
a wiper system and a rail system. For protective materials, we found through
collision tests that polycarbonate was very promising, though the most
important factor was layering a soft material between the panel's surface and a
hard material. In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was
more efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and
total power consumption.

capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and
Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and
Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We
envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for
embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented
systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations
on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets,
such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve system stability and position tracking in haptic-enabled human-robot interaction while addressing desynchronization issues.

Method: The authors designed a two-port passivity-based stabilizer utilizing human biomechanics, and validated it through mathematical proofs, simulations, and experiments.

Result: Experiments showed that TBPS2 improved position synchronization and was less conservative than other state-of-the-art algorithms, even with communication delays.

Conclusion: TBPS2 effectively enhanced system stability and synchronization, proving its superiority over existing solutions in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking is imperative in
networked robotic systems, particularly for haptics-enabled human-robot
interaction. Recent literature has integrated human biomechanics into the
stabilizers implemented for teleoperation, enhancing force preservation while
guaranteeing convergence and safety. However, position desynchronization due to
imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors remains a challenge. This
paper proposes a two-port biomechanics-aware passivity-based synchronizer and
stabilizer, referred to as TBPS2. This stabilizer optimizes position
synchronization by leveraging human biomechanics while reducing the
stabilizer's conservatism in its activation. We provide the mathematical design
synthesis of the stabilizer and the proof of stability. We also conducted a
series of grid simulations and systematic experiments, comparing their
performance with that of state-of-the-art solutions under varying time delays
and environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP) for robotic visuomotor tasks, improving robustness and interpretability over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion policies for robotic visuomotor control struggle with robustness in long-horizon tasks and lack interpretable representations.

Method: MoE-DP incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between a visual encoder and diffusion model, dynamically activating specialized task experts.

Result: MoE-DP achieves a 36% improvement in success rate under disturbances in multi-stage tasks and demonstrates strong performance both in simulations and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: MoE-DP not only enhances task robustness but also provides interpretable skill decomposition, enabling subtask rearrangement during inference without retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful framework for robotic
visuomotor control, yet they often lack the robustness to recover from subtask
failures in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks and their learned representations
of observations are often difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose the
Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is
to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the
diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of
specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases
of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a
strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming
standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation
tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under
disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real
world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show
that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts
correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This
learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the
rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are

TL;DR: The paper introduces a centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic systems to ensure stability and enhance performance in networked architectures with time-varying delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of stability in Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic systems, which face limitations in conventional passivity-based approaches such as rigidity, decentralized compensation, and restrictive assumptions of node passivity.

Method: The paper proposes a centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework that includes a centralized passivity observer for monitoring energy flow and a Tunable Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC) to distribute dissipation optimally across nodes. It follows a data-driven, model-free approach.

Result: Simulation results show the framework's effectiveness in performing complex tasks under varying time-delay conditions, proving its scalability, flexibility, and relaxation of typical assumptions like node passivity.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust model-free centralized control method that stabilizes CMND systems efficiently while enhancing flexibility, generalizability, and scalability in networked control systems.

Abstract: Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic (CMND) systems have emerged as a key
architecture with applications in several complex network systems, such as
multilateral telerobotics and multi-agent control. These systems consist of a
hub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a
networked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can
be affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based
approaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like
small-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers
have several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems
in a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying
on the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a
centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems.
It consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow
and an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed
dissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2
stability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable
Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance
based on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring
stability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks
while relaxing the dissipation on other nodes. Simulation results demonstrate
the proposed frameworks performance in a complex task under different
time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing the remote nodes minimum phase and
passivity assumption, enhancing the scalability and generalizability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAPOM, leveraging topology-aware analysis to improve robotic manipulation in complex, narrow spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in robotic manipulation during navigation in tight, low-clearance spaces.

Method: The proposed TAPOM framework combines high-level topological analysis to identify key pathways and low-level planning for trajectory configuration.

Result: Experiments show TAPOM achieves higher success rates and efficiency compared to existing methods in manipulation tasks within constrained spaces.

Conclusion: TAPOM enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, making robots more effective in real-world complex environments.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread
applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with
elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance
scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work
proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which
explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient
planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and
generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find
feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates
significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad
implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex

*Bin Fan,Jianjian Jiang,Zhuohao Li,Yixiang He,Xiaoming Wu,Yihan Yang,Shengbang Liu,Weishi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Dual-Actor Policy (DAP) for object manipulation, dividing tasks into two stages (approaching and manipulation) and using distinct visual priors to enhance performance, achieving better results than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for object manipulation rely on a single policy to learn tasks, not considering the distinction between approaching and manipulation stages, which leads to inefficiencies.

Method: The study introduces a Dual-Actor Policy (DAP) that separately uses affordance-based actors for the approaching stage and motion flow-based actors for the manipulation stage, coupled with a decision maker to allocate tasks accordingly. A new dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation Dataset, is also created to aid training.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, improving task success rates by 5.55%, 14.7%, and 10.4% in various benchmarks.

Conclusion: By explicitly separating object manipulation into stages and leveraging tailored visual priors, DAP improves task execution efficiency and robustness, validated through experimental results and a newly constructed dataset.

Abstract: Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar
parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching
stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this
characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the
whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different
stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.
Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional
part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.
Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of
the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a
decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the
corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain
few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address
this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation
Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks,
including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on
our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that
our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4%
on average respectively.

TL;DR: This paper highlights the use of imitation learning algorithms to improve user comfort and experience in autonomous micro-mobility platforms, specifically in crowded and dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing user comfort and user experience in autonomous micro-mobility platforms, a critical but understudied goal for commercial applications, rather than focusing solely on traditional performance metrics like speed or efficiency.

Method: The authors leverage imitation learning to develop smoother and more effective control algorithms for autonomous wheelchairs, analyzing the performance of different neural network architectures in real-world environments.

Result: The improved controllers, based on imitation learning, deliver state-of-the-art user comfort, particularly in scenarios like follow-me mode for assisting people with reduced mobility.

Conclusion: Imitation learning algorithms offer significant advantages for autonomous micro-mobility platforms by enhancing user comfort, demonstrating usability in real-world, production-level applications.

Abstract: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of
the typical deployment environment: large indoor spaces or urban areas that are
potentially crowded and highly dynamic. While social navigation algorithms have
progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience
over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is
understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial
applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother
and overall better controllers, versus previously used manually-tuned
controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves
state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human
operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes
different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates
their usability in real-world production-level deployments.

Conclusion: The study effectively showcases a structured security auditing solution for mitigating risks in autonomous systems.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous systems has experienced remarkable growth in
recent years, driven by their integration into sectors such as industry,
medicine, logistics, and domestic environments. This expansion is accompanied
by a series of security issues that entail significant risks due to the
critical nature of autonomous systems, especially those operating in
human-interaction environments. Furthermore, technological advancement and the
high operational and architectural complexity of autonomous systems have
resulted in an increased attack surface. This article presents a specific
security auditing procedure for autonomous systems, based on a layer-structured
methodology, a threat taxonomy adapted to the robotic context, and a set of
concrete mitigation measures. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through four practical case studies applied to representative
robotic platforms: the Vision 60 military quadruped from Ghost Robotics, the A1
robot from Unitree Robotics, the UR3 collaborative arm from Universal Robots,
and the Pepper social robot from Aldebaran Robotics.

### [221] [Let Me Show You: Learning by Retrieving from Egocentric Video for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05199)
*Yichen Zhu,Feifei Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method where robots learn manipulation tasks by watching human video demonstrations, using extracted mid-level information from the videos to enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often struggle in uncertain environments and rely heavily on large datasets, whereas humans can learn tasks by observing demonstrations. This study seeks to bring such human learning analogies into robotic systems.

Method: The system uses a video bank of human demonstrations and extracts mid-level information like object affordance masks and hand trajectories. A video retriever fetches task-relevant videos, and a policy generator integrates this knowledge for robot learning.

Result: The robots using the proposed system showcased improved adaptability and performance in simulated and real-world tasks compared to traditional systems.

Conclusion: The proposed RfV method represents a significant advancement by enabling robots to generalize better and adapt to scenarios beyond existing training data, marking progress in robotic manipulation learning.

Abstract: Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable
challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn
manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks,
such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot
policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human
demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video
bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich
the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as
object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional
inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities.
We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an
external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification,
and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the
learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to
various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data.
Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our
system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional
robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of
robotics.

### [222] [Beyond Master and Apprentice: Grounding Foundation Models for Symbiotic Interactive Learning in a Shared Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05203)
*Linus Nwankwo,Björn Ellensohn,Christian Rauch,Elmar Rueckert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach for human-robot interaction to enhance co-adaptive, bidirectional interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HRI models rely on reactive systems where agents passively execute human commands rather than engaging in reciprocal learning.

Method: Formalizes SIL as a co-adaptation process in shared latent task space using pre-trained foundation models and lightweight latent encoders. Includes a memory architecture to maintain learned representations.

Result: SIL demonstrated success in simulated and real-world tasks like instruction following, interactive dialogues, and query-oriented reasoning.

Conclusion: SIL enhances human-robot interaction by enabling agents to proactively clarify, adapt, and refine shared tasks, emphasizing co-adaptive dynamics.

Abstract: Today's autonomous agents can understand free-form natural language
instructions and execute long-horizon tasks in a manner akin to human-level
reasoning. These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained
foundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are
grounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice
model, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes
the master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive
interaction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in
everyday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a
Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and
the apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We
formalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,
where the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on
interaction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution
to proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.
To realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial
perception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds
the models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure
stability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that
prevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL
on both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction
following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive
dialogues. Demos and resources are public

### [223] [Context-aware Learned Mesh-based Simulation via Trajectory-Level Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05234)
*Philipp Dahlinger,Niklas Freymuth,Tai Hoang,Tobias Würth,Michael Volpp,Luise Kärger,Gerhard Neumann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), a new simulation model that improves accuracy and speed over existing methods for simulating object deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing learned simulators used for object deformation simulations. These include reliance on single-step observations (hindering temporal context usage), failure to infer material properties, and susceptibility to error accumulation in auto-regressive rollouts.

Method: The authors propose treating mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. They employ Conditional Neural Processes and movement primitives to achieve rapid adaptation, while enabling predictions directly through a single model call.

Result: M3GN demonstrates higher simulation accuracy and reduced runtime costs compared to existing state-of-the-art Learned Graph Network Simulators for various scientific tasks.

Conclusion: By framing simulations as a trajectory-level problem and leveraging conditional learning, M3GN overcomes key limitations and offers a more efficient, accurate method for simulating object deformation across diverse applications.

Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific
domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned
Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make
them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate
simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.
However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step
observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without
this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.
Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error
for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a
trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our
method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited
initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize
movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations
from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive
Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of
the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

### [224] [TwinVLA: Data-Efficient Bimanual Manipulation with Twin Single-Arm Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05275)
*Hokyun Im,Euijin Jeong,Jianlong Fu,Andrey Kolobov,Youngwoon Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TwinVLA is a framework that combines pretrained single-arm vision-language-action models to achieve better performance on bimanual manipulation tasks without requiring additional bimanual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robotic datasets focus on single-arm demonstrations, limiting the scalability of bimanual manipulation due to the need for costly additional data and fine-tuning.

Method: TwinVLA uses two modular, pretrained single-arm VLAs to work coordinately as a bimanual manipulation model, overcoming the need for large-scale bimanual-specific pretraining.

Result: TwinVLA surpasses the performance of monolithic models on diverse bimanual tasks and approaches the capabilities of state-of-the-art models that rely on proprietary data, without requiring expensive bimanual training.

Conclusion: TwinVLA offers a scalable and data-efficient solution for high-performance bimanual manipulation by leveraging widely available single-arm robotic data.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets
have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual
tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm
demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial
additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we
introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained
single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic
cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,
TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained
single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation
settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model
without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to
state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual
data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach
as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual
manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

*Akua K. Dickson,Juan C. Pacheco Garcia,Andrew P. Sabelhaus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for detecting and ensuring force safety in soft robot manipulators, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance in delicate environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current obstacle detection methods fail to consider force limits when interacting with delicate obstacles, which poses risks in soft robot manipulators.

Method: The authors developed a framework mapping task-space force safety criteria to configuration space, using forward kinematics to identify force-safe robot configurations in real-time.

Result: The approach was validated via simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot, successfully detecting force safety with deformable obstacles.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for real-time safe planning of soft robot manipulators operating in cluttered, delicate environments.

Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate
environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle
detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that
manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work
introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e.
positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's
joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate
limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space
obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the
manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations
classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby
allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot
manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware
experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results
demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during
interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for
real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered
environments.

*Eric Godden,Jacquie Groenewegen,Matthew K. X. J. Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ETHOS is a dynamic haptic system for VR, enabling natural touch during social interactions using torque-controlled robotics and real-time tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social interactions in VR lack realistic physical contact, hindering immersive experiences. ETHOS aims to address this gap.

Method: The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator, passive props, marker-based registration, and safety measures, with two proposed control strategies for haptic interactions.

Result: ETHOS achieves accurate alignment and latency benchmarks, enabling realistic physical contact during VR social exchanges.

Conclusion: ETHOS demonstrates the feasibility of high-fidelity, safe, and dynamic haptic interactions in virtual environments.

Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction),
a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical
contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers,
fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic
manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a
baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a
safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We
introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary
prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD
baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by
exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand
tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests
show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions
achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21
ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the
feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating
essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical
foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual
environments.

Conclusion: EverydayVLA successfully combines sophisticated VLA capabilities with accessible, low-cost hardware, democratizing the use of advanced robotic foundation models and enabling economical deployment in households and research labs.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models map visual inputs and language
instructions directly to robot actions, they often rely on costly hardware and
struggle in novel or cluttered scenes. We introduce EverydayVLA, a 6-DOF
manipulator that can be assembled for under $300, capable of modest payloads
and workspace. A single unified model jointly outputs discrete and continuous
actions, and our adaptive-horizon ensemble monitors motion uncertainty to
trigger on-the-fly re-planning for safe, reliable operation. On LIBERO,
EverydayVLA matches state-of-the-art success rates, and in real-world tests it
outperforms prior methods by 49% in-distribution and 34.9% out-of-distribution.

*Muhammad Saud Ul Hassan,Derek Vasquez,Hamza Asif,Christian Hubicki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a control architecture for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots using an energy-conservation-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate the stable dynamic motion observed in biological quadrupeds in robotic systems by leveraging energy-conservation principles.

Method: The robot is modeled as a Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) to control leg orientation during flight and leg length during stance. A control algorithm using SLIP dynamics tracks a stable parabolic spline based on energy conservation.

Result: Simulations on Ghost Robotics Minitaur demonstrate that the algorithm produces stable bouncing gaits and is robust, even with up to a 10% sensor measurement error.

Conclusion: The proposed control architecture efficiently achieves stable and robust dynamic motion in quadruped robots, inspired by biological principles.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture
for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a
Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the
bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological
quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation
control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice
inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped
systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the
quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated
using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the
design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we
demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.
Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its
ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in
sensor measurements.

*Luca Girardi,Gabriel Maquignaz,Stefano Mintchev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlexiQuad introduces a soft-frame quadrotor inspired by natural flyers, providing enhanced agility, collision resilience, and squeezability while maintaining high flight performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the limitations of rigid-frame quadrotors in cluttered environments, this paper aims to enhance flight capabilities by mimicking the structural properties of natural flyers' wings.

Method: FlexiQuad employs anisotropic stiffness and distributed mass-energy structures in its soft-frame quadrotor design. Prototypes were tested for agility, squeezability, and collision resilience under various conditions.

Result: The FlexiQuad prototype achieved high speeds (80 km/h), rapid accelerations, high collision resilience (surviving 5 m/s impacts), and flight through narrow passages while offering comparable performance to rigid quadrotors.

Conclusion: FlexiQuad demonstrates that integrating structural softness comparable to natural flyers can expand hovering drone functionality in complex environments without compromising agility.

Abstract: Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight
behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways,
and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely
on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision
resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in
cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed
mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce
FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.
We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more
compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres
with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3
g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate
accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.
Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,
surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising
forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,
enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our
analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77
N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,
squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad
models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in
complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without
compromising flight performance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AI-powered coding tools are transforming software engineering by autonomously handling refactoring tasks to improve code quality. Large-scale analysis revealed agents focus on localized, internal quality improvements with statistically significant enhancements in structural metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the usage, comparison, and impact of AI-driven refactoring on software development practices and code quality.

Method: Analyzed 15,451 refactoring instances from open-source Java projects using the AIDev dataset, evaluating refactoring types, motivations, and code metrics.

Result: Agents prefer low-level refactorings like variable renaming and focus on maintainability and readability, achieving small but significant improvements in structural metrics.

Conclusion: Agent-based refactoring emphasizes internal quality improvements, offering tangible benefits for sustainable software development through targeted, localized changes.

Abstract: Agentic coding tools, such as OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor, are
transforming the software engineering landscape. These AI-powered systems
function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex
development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a
cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal
code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing
adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical understanding regarding how
agentic refactoring is utilized in practice, how it compares to human-driven
refactoring, and what impact it has on code quality. To address this empirical
gap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in
real-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances
across 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset.
Our empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional
activity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting
refactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that
agentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as
Change Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable
(8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level
design changes common in human refactoring. Additionally, the motivations
behind agentic refactoring focus overwhelmingly on internal quality concerns,
with maintainability (52.5%) and readability (28.1%). Furthermore, quantitative
evaluation of code quality metrics shows that agentic refactoring yields small
but statistically significant improvements in structural metrics, particularly
for medium-level changes, reducing class size and complexity (e.g., Class LOC
median $\Delta$ = -15.25).

*Quang-Dung Nguyen,Tri-Dung Tran,Thanh-Hieu Chu,Hoang-Loc Tran,Xiangwei Cheng,Dirk Slama*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores the use of advanced prompt engineering techniques to adapt large language models (LLMs) for Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) code generation without altering their architecture or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently developing applications for Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) by leveraging the potential of LLMs through prompting techniques.

Method: Advanced prompt engineering techniques, including few-shot prompting, were applied to LLMs to adapt them for SDV-specific code generation tasks. Experiments were conducted using a specially created benchmark to evaluate the performance.

Result: The study found that few-shot prompting significantly outperforms other methods in adapting LLMs for SDV code generation, delivering optimal results based on quantitative performance metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs can be utilized effectively for SDV-specific tasks with no need for model re-training or proprietary architectural access, as demonstrated by employing strategic prompting techniques.

Abstract: The emergence of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) marks a paradigm shift in
the automotive industry, where software now plays a pivotal role in defining
vehicle functionality, enabling rapid innovation of modern vehicles. Developing
SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation
and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across
domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders
their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we
propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and
redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and
efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering
techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access
to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on
different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare
models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in
generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot
prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match
the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.

*Mohammadreza Saeidi,Ethan Thoma,Raula Gaikovina Kula,Gema Rodríguez-Pérez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates maintainer responsiveness to bug reports in npm libraries, identifying reasons for unaddressed bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software depends heavily on third-party libraries, making their reliability crucial. However, interconnected dependencies can pose challenges when bugs go unfixed.

Method: The authors analyzed 30,340 bug reports from 500 highly depended-upon npm packages through repository mining and qualitative coding.

Result: Maintainers show strong responsiveness, with a median responsiveness rate of 70%, but certain bugs remain unfixed due to contribution practices, constraints, and standards.

Conclusion: This study provides a taxonomy of reasons for unaddressed bugs, encouraging strategies aimed at enhancing the robustness of open-source ecosystems.

Abstract: Background: Widespread use of third-party libraries makes ecosystems like
Node Package Manager (npm) critical to modern software development. However,
this interconnected chain of dependencies also creates challenges: bugs in one
library can propagate downstream, potentially impacting many other libraries
that rely on it. We hypothesize that maintainers may not always decide to fix a
bug, especially if the maintainer decides it falls out of their responsibility
within the chain of dependencies. Aims: To confirm this hypothesis, we
investigate the responsiveness of 30,340 bug reports across 500 of the most
depended-upon npm packages. Method: We adopt a mixed-method approach to mine
repository issue data and perform qualitative open coding to analyze reasons
behind unaddressed bug reports. Results: Our findings show that maintainers are
generally responsive, with a median project-level responsiveness of 70% (IQR:
55%-89%), reflecting their commitment to support downstream developers.
Conclusions: We present a taxonomy of the reasons some bugs remain unresolved.
The taxonomy includes contribution practices, dependency constraints, and
library-specific standards as reasons for not being responsive. Understanding
maintainer behavior can inform practices that promote a more robust and
responsive open-source ecosystem that benefits the entire community.

### [233] [Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165)
*Ahmad Hatahet,Christoph Knieke,Andreas Rausch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-automated approach for generating Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) from source code using reverse engineering techniques integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software Architecture Descriptions are often outdated, missing, or poorly aligned with system implementations, leading to an increased cognitive load for developers and system degradation.

Method: Reverse engineering techniques were integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, static and behavioral architectural views were recovered through prompt engineering and few-shot prompting, generating component diagrams and state machine diagrams.

Result: The method successfully presents a scalable and maintainable process to generate architectural documentation, reducing reliance on human experts and improving the accuracy of software behavior representations.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in simplifying architectural documentation processes, enhancing software understanding, and ensuring maintainable systems.

Abstract: Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the
inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level
architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective
communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often
missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation.
Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights
directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive
load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual
degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we
propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating
reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our
approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting
a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant
elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine
diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with
few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and
maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation.
This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent
capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the
reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex
software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge
through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward
significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and
long-term maintainability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeMapper is a tool designed to address the code mapping problem during software evolution by accurately mapping specific code regions across commits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing approaches like git diff and specialized tools, which fail to focus on specific code regions or are restricted to particular programming languages.

Method: CodeMapper uses a two-phase approach: (i) identifying candidate regions via diff analysis, code movement detection, and code fragment search; and (ii) selecting the best match through similarity calculations.

Result: Evaluation on datasets, including two hand-annotated ones across ten programming languages, shows CodeMapper achieves 71.0%–94.5% accuracy, outperforming other tools by 1.5–58.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: CodeMapper provides a language-agnostic and efficient solution to the code mapping problem, significantly improving accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: During software evolution, developers commonly face the problem of mapping a
specific code region from one commit to another. For example, they may want to
determine how the condition of an if-statement, a specific line in a
configuration file, or the definition of a function changes. We call this the
code mapping problem. Existing techniques, such as git diff, address this
problem only insufficiently because they show all changes made to a file
instead of focusing on a code region of the developer's choice. Other
techniques focus on specific code elements and programming languages (e.g.,
methods in Java), limiting their applicability. This paper introduces
CodeMapper, an approach to address the code mapping problem in a way that is
independent of specific program elements and programming languages. Given a
code region in one commit, CodeMapper finds the corresponding region in another
commit. The approach consists of two phases: (i) computing candidate regions by
analyzing diffs, detecting code movements, and searching for specific code
fragments, and (ii) selecting the most likely target region by calculating
similarities. Our evaluation applies CodeMapper to four datasets, including two
new hand-annotated datasets containing code region pairs in ten popular
programming languages. CodeMapper correctly identifies the expected target
region in 71.0%--94.5% of all cases, improving over the best available
baselines by 1.5--58.8 absolute percent points.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for enhancing Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) by automatically building state-action knowledge graphs from enterprise applications for more accurate and reliable LLM-assisted user guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve the reliability and utility of Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs), which support employees in navigating complex enterprise software. Current methods demand extensive manual effort, and existing LLMs are prone to inaccuracies without structured data.

Method: The paper presents a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically extracts and structures enterprise web applications into state-action knowledge graphs. These graphs are then used to enhance the grounding and context-aware generation of answers by LLMs.

Result: The framework facilitates the creation of interactive, reliable, and scalable assistance within DAPs, improving user experience while reducing manual effort. It demonstrates efficient integration into production workflows in collaboration with AI enterprise RAKAM and Lemon Learning.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and robust solution for leveraging LLMs in DAPs by addressing challenges such as hallucinations and black-box API limitations. Lessons and deployment strategies for real-world applications are highlighted.

Abstract: Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) have become essential tools for helping
employees navigate complex enterprise software such as CRM, ERP, or HRMS
systems. Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can
reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and
maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort.
Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing
alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software,
LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most
production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to
the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise
web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate
grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the
AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the
engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the
design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our
approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability,
robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.

TL;DR: RARe, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based approach, improves automated code reviews by combining retrieval-based and generative methods. It outperforms existing methods in benchmarks and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automated code review generation, where reviews may be off-point or overly general, and to enhance software quality efficiently through more reliable automation.

Method: A Retrieval-Augmented Review approach (RARe) combining a dense retriever to select relevant reviews and a neural generator, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for contextual learning.

Result: RARe achieves state-of-the-art results, with BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96 on benchmark datasets, validated further by human evaluations and a case study using an interpretability tool.

Conclusion: RARe demonstrates improved practical utility and reliability in automated code review generation, effectively addressing prior limitations and enhancing the process with domain-relevant knowledge.

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but is
labor-intensive. Automated code review generation offers a promising solution
to this challenge. Both deep learning-based generative techniques and
retrieval-based methods have demonstrated strong performance in this task.
However, despite these advancements, there are still some limitations where
generated reviews can be either off-point or overly general. To address these
issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Reviewer (RARe), which leverages
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine retrieval-based and generative
methods, explicitly incorporating external domain knowledge into the code
review process. RARe uses a dense retriever to select the most relevant reviews
from the codebase, which then enrich the input for a neural generator,
utilizing the contextual learning capacity of large language models (LLMs), to
produce the final review. RARe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two
benchmark datasets, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 12.32 and 12.96, respectively.
Its effectiveness is further validated through a detailed human evaluation and
a case study using an interpretability tool, demonstrating its practical
utility and reliability.

Conclusion: SWE-Compass provides a production-aligned, rigorous benchmark, enabling more accurate diagnosis and improvement of the coding capabilities of LLMs in real-world software engineering.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for software engineering has been
limited by narrow task coverage, language bias, and insufficient alignment with
real-world developer workflows. Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic
problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software
engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a
comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations

types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000
high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined
through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art
LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear
hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover,
by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass
provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing

*Md. Abdul Awal,Mrigank Rochan,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation compresses code language models but often fails to ensure behavioral fidelity, leading to performance drops under adversarial attacks. MetaCompress evaluates discrepancies systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of deploying large transformer-based language models of code due to high computational costs and environmental impacts by exploring knowledge distillation techniques.

Method: The study introduces MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework, to systematically assess behavioral fidelity using behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. Three different knowledge distillation methods (Compressor, AVATAR, MORPH) are evaluated.

Result: MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, revealing issues with behavioral fidelity in compressed models. It shows significant disparities in predictive behavior compared to traditional evaluation.

Conclusion: Behavioral fidelity evaluation is crucial when compressing language models to ensure reliability. MetaCompress is practical for assessing discrepancies and improving the performance of distilled models.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their
practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow
inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these
challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as
a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a
smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree
to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal
representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current
accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality
and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity
between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically
show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,
resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,
which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we
propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically
evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student
models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate
MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular
language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation
techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress
identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring
the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation
pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing
compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.

*Arianna Di Bernardo,Adrian Valente,Francesca Mastrogiuseppe,Srdjan Ostojic*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper connects neural activity coordination to geometric structures called manifolds, utilizing group representation theory to relate connectivity symmetries and network outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between recurrent network connectivity symmetries and the geometry of neural manifolds, inspired by observed coordination in neuronal firing.

Method: Using group representation theory, the authors formalize connectivity symmetries and their geometry, introducing equivariant RNNs with group convolution and analyzing them via group Fourier transform.

Result: The study identifies connectivity principles that produce fixed-point manifolds and explores their symmetry, dimensionality, and stability, highlighting coexistence of stable and unstable manifolds.

Conclusion: The paper establishes links between connectivity patterns and neural manifold geometries, emphasizing the necessity of stability analysis for understanding network dynamics.

Abstract: Recordings of increasingly large neural populations have revealed that the
firing of individual neurons is highly coordinated. When viewed in the space of
all possible patterns, the collective activity forms non-linear structures
called neural manifolds. Because such structures are observed even at rest or
during sleep, an important hypothesis is that activity manifolds may correspond
to continuous attractors shaped by recurrent connectivity between neurons.
Classical models of recurrent networks have shown that continuous attractors
can be generated by specific symmetries in the connectivity. Although a variety
of attractor network models have been studied, general principles linking
network connectivity and the geometry of attractors remain to be formulated.
Here, we address this question by using group representation theory to
formalize the relationship between the symmetries in recurrent connectivity and
the resulting fixed-point manifolds. We start by revisiting the classical ring
model, a continuous attractor network generating a circular manifold.
Interpreting its connectivity as a circular convolution, we draw a parallel
with feed-forward CNNs. Building on principles of geometric deep learning, we
then generalize this architecture to a broad range of symmetries using group
representation theory. Specifically, we introduce a new class of equivariant
RNNs, where the connectivity is based on group convolution. Using the group
Fourier transform, we reduce such networks to low-rank models, giving us a
low-dimensional description that can be fully analyzed to determine the
symmetry, dimensionality and stability of fixed-point manifolds. Our results
underline the importance of stability considerations: for a connectivity with a
given symmetry, depending on parameters, several manifolds with different
symmetry subgroups can coexist, some stable and others consisting of saddle
points.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the motor cortex's involvement in brain-machine interface control, focusing on its dynamic behavior during movements of varying durations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how motor cortex activity shifts during BMI control to facilitate precise and sustained movements.

Method: The researchers studied MC activity during BMI cursor movements of varying durations, analyzing initial conditions and neural dynamics.

Result: MC initial conditions were shared across movements, but longer durations showed sustained neural activity, pausing dynamics until a goal was achieved.

Conclusion: Sustained inputs to the motor cortex play a critical role in managing movements of varying durations necessary for effective BMI control.

Abstract: The motor cortex (MC) is often described as an autonomous dynamical system
during movement execution. In an autonomous dynamical system, flexible movement
generation depends on reconfiguring the initial conditions, which then unwind
along known dynamics. An open question is whether these dynamics govern MC
activity during brain-machine interface (BMI) control. We investigated MC
activity during BMI cursor movements of multiple durations, ranging from
hundreds of milliseconds to sustained over seconds. These durations were chosen
to cover the range of movement durations necessary to control modern BMIs under
varying precision levels. Movements shared their MC initial condition with
movements of different durations in the same direction. Long-duration movements
sustained MC activity, effectively pausing the neural population dynamics until
each movement goal was reached. The difference across durations in MC
population dynamics may be attributed to external inputs. Our results highlight
the role of sustained inputs to MC during movement.

*Assma Habadi,Milos Zefran,Lijuan Yin,Woojin Song,Maria Caceres,Elise Hu,Naoko Muramatsu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores how wearable devices and AI can noninvasively assess cognitive functions in older adults, achieving accurate predictions of cognitive test scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive screening tools are time-intensive, disruptive, and limited to momentary assessments. Wearables, by capturing continuous physiological signals, provide a less invasive alternative for tracking cognitive functions.

Method: The study involved 23 older adults using the Empatica EmbracePlus wearable, which recorded physiological data during cognitive tests. Features were extracted using wavelet-based and segmentation methods, while supervised learning techniques evaluated predictive accuracy.

Result: Models exhibited high performance, with Spearman's correlations ranging from 0.73-0.82 and low mean absolute errors. Specific sensor combinations predicted different cognitive skills; for example, heart signals with movement predicted working memory well.

Conclusion: Wearable sensors coupled with AI enable accurate, continuous, and noninvasive cognitive monitoring in older adults. This approach is especially valuable for small datasets and has potential to advance remote and clinical interventions.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the
cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild
dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive
screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief
snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by
continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether
physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive
tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23
older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess
working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a
wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature,
and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and
segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated
predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results:
Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean
absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean
predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement
and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin
conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with
skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These
findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised
learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive
functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study
demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This
approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.

*Henry D. J. Kerr,Peter Ashwin,Kyle C. A. Wedgwood*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of slow voltage-gated ion channels on the dynamics of traveling waves in a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with lateral inhibition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual neural and ionic properties influence network-scale behavior, specifically traveling waves, in excitable networks.

Method: The paper uses a mathematical model of a laterally-inhibited network with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons modulated by a slow voltage-gated ion channel, complemented by simulations and a novel root-finding algorithm to explore solution space.

Result: The study finds that ion channel strength increases wave speed, facilitates subthreshold oscillations, introduces codimension-2 grazing bifurcations, and complicates the solution space with intermediate structures, which influence the behavior of traveling waves.

Conclusion: The results reveal that slow ion channels significantly affect wave characteristics and highlight the role of neighboring solution branches in wave behavior, shedding light on the detailed dynamics of excitable networks.

Abstract: Travelling waves of neural firing activity are observed in brain tissue as a
part of various sensory, motor and cognitive processes. They represent an
object of major interest in the study of excitable networks, with analysis
conducted in both neural field models and spiking neuronal networks. The latter
class exposes the single-neuron dynamics directly, allowing us to study the
details of their influence upon network-scale behaviour. Here we present a
study of a laterally-inhibited network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons
modulated by a slow voltage-gated ion channel that acts as a linear adaptation
variable. As the strength of the ion channel increases, we find that its
interaction with the lateral inhibition increases wave speeds. The ion channel
can enable subthreshold oscillations, with the intervals between the firing
events of loosely-coupled travelling wave solutions structured around the
neuron's natural period. These subthreshold oscillations also enable the
occurrence of codimension-2 grazing bifurcations; along with the emergence of
fold bifurcations along wave solution branches, the slow ion channel introduces
a variety of intermediate structures in the solution space. These point towards
further investigation of the role neighbouring solution branches play in the
behaviour of waves forced across bifurcations, which we illustrate with the aid
of simulations using a novel root-finding algorithm designed to handle
uncertainty over the existence of firing solutions.

Conclusion: The framework advances prototype learning in algorithmic and geometric aspects, offering practical tools for efficient and interpretable classification.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an explosion in statistical learning literature to

subsets (prototypes) from large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
TPS on simulated data under different data intrinsic characteristics, and
compare TPS against other currently used prototype selection methods in real

preserves or improves classification performance while substantially reducing
data size. These contributions advance both algorithmic and geometric aspects

TL;DR: A scalable online kernel learning framework is introduced to estimate bidirectional causal effects in systems with mutual dependence and heteroskedasticity, demonstrating superior accuracy and near-linear scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal inference often neglects real-world bidirectional relationships, requiring a method to identify such dynamics efficiently with mutual dependence and heteroskedasticity.

Method: The framework combines heteroskedasticity-based identification with quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and large-scale online kernel learning using random Fourier features and adaptive online gradient descent.

Result: Simulation results show lower bias and root mean squared error compared to baselines, effectively capturing complex bidirectional causal effects with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach blends econometric and machine learning techniques to enable scalable, accurate causal inference for diverse applications in science, policy, business, and industry.

Abstract: In this study, a scalable online kernel learning framework is proposed for
estimating bidirectional causal effects in systems characterized by mutual
dependence and heteroskedasticity. Traditional causal inference often focuses
on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships
in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification,
the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for
simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It
employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear
conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent
algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional
data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial
approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error
across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the
proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects
with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification
with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal
inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial
applications.

*Shubhayan Pan,Saptarshi Chakraborty,Debolina Paul,Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a kernelized convex clustering method to address limitations with non-linear or non-convex data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convex clustering performs poorly on linearly non-separable or non-convex data structures, leading to the exploration of alternative methods.

Method: The proposed method uses kernel tricks to project data into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), enabling convex clustering in the transformed feature space.

Result: Theoretical guarantees including convergence and finite sample bounds are established, with experiments on synthetic and real-world data showing superior performance compared to current techniques.

Conclusion: Kernelized convex clustering offers a meaningful advancement for handling complex data distributions, outperforming existing methods and providing effective solutions for non-linear and non-convex scenarios.

Abstract: Convex clustering is a well-regarded clustering method, resembling the
similar centroid-based approach of Lloyd's $k$-means, without requiring a
predefined cluster count. It starts with each data point as its centroid and
iteratively merges them. Despite its advantages, this method can fail when
dealing with data exhibiting linearly non-separable or non-convex structures.
To mitigate the limitations, we propose a kernelized extension of the convex
clustering method. This approach projects the data points into a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a feature map, enabling convex clustering in
this transformed space. This kernelization not only allows for better handling
of complex data distributions but also produces an embedding in a
finite-dimensional vector space. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
underpinnings for our kernelized approach, proving algorithmic convergence and
establishing finite sample bounds for our estimates. The effectiveness of our
method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
clustering techniques. This work marks a significant advancement in the field,
offering an effective solution for clustering in non-linear and non-convex data
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed deep learning, while promising for solving PDEs, struggles with accuracy and efficiency in complex problems.

Method: A new framework combines adaptive sampling to locate regions with rapid solution variation and adaptive weighting to balance convergence rates among training points.

Result: Numerical experiments show that combining sampling and weighting improves the accuracy and efficiency of PINNs consistently better than using them separately.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a robust enhancement in PINN performance for solving PDEs, emphasizing the importance of simultaneous adaptive strategies.

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these
models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited
accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling
and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in
regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive
weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points.
Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only
adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate
predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method
emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem
dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently
improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust
approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.

TL;DR: The paper revises and refines the DCQCN mechanism to enhance congestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control traffic and unnecessary throttling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolution of supercomputers and data centers has introduced challenges in interconnection network performance due to congestion caused by modern applications.

Method: The study revisits the DCQCN mechanism, refining its design for accurate congestion detection and signaling, and improves injection throttling to avoid unnecessary control traffic and throttling.

Result: The refined approach reduces control traffic overhead and avoids throttling non-congesting flows, improving the performance of interconnection networks.

Conclusion: The improved DCQCN mechanism better addresses congestion in high-performance networks, aligning with modern application dynamics and enhancing system efficiency.

Abstract: Over the past decade, Supercomputers and Data centers have evolved
dramatically to cope with the increasing performance requirements of
applications and services, such as scientific computing, generative AI, social
networks or cloud services. This evolution have led these systems to
incorporate high-speed networks using faster links, end nodes using multiple
and dedicated accelerators, or a advancements in memory technologies to bridge
the memory bottleneck. The interconnection network is a key element in these
systems and it must be thoroughly designed so it is not the bottleneck of the
entire system, bearing in mind the countless communication operations that
generate current applications and services. Congestion is serious threat that
spoils the interconnection network performance, and its effects are even more
dramatic when looking at the traffic dynamics and bottlenecks generated by the
communication operations mentioned above. In this vein, numerous congestion
control (CC) techniques have been developed to address congestion negative
effects. One popular example is Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification
(DCQCN), which allows congestion detection at network switch buffers, then
marking congesting packets and notifying about congestion to the sources, which
finally apply injection throttling of those packets contributing to congestion.
While DCQCN has been widely studied and improved, its main principles for
congestion detection, notification and reaction remain largely unchanged, which
is an important shortcoming considering congestion dynamics in current
high-performance interconnection networks. In this paper, we revisit the DCQCN
closed-loop mechanism and refine its design to leverage a more accurate
congestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control
traffic overhead and avoiding unnecessary throttling of non-congesting flows.

### [249] [Machine Learning-Driven Analysis of kSZ Maps to Predict CMB Optical Depth $τ$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04770)
*Farshid Farhadi Khouzani,Abinash Kumar Shaw,Paul La Plante,Bryar Mustafa Shareef,Laxmi Gewali*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning-based method for extracting the optical depth of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), leveraging simulated maps of the kSZ effect, with advanced uncertainty quantification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better constrain early structure formation models by precisely measuring the key cosmic parameter (optical depth, $\tau$) derived from the weak kSZ signal, which faces challenges due to contamination from astrophysical foregrounds.

Method: The authors employ machine learning models, including swin transformers, trained on high-resolution simulations of the kSZ signal. They use the Laplace Approximation (LA) to quantify uncertainty robustly, comparing post-hoc and online optimization approaches.

Result: The approach effectively extracts $\tau$ from simulated maps, showcasing reliable uncertainty quantification and paving the way for improved constraints on CMB optical depth.

Conclusion: This framework is promising for enhancing the analysis of future CMB surveys, such as the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, by enabling robust measurements of $\tau$ and its uncertainties.

Abstract: Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which
results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving
electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ
signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial
structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a
key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density,
would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the
weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to
significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine
learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced
machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution
seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction
uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This
approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the
posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error
estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a
post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model
weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal
likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$
and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB
surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.

### [250] [Blind Strong Gravitational Lensing Inversion: Joint Inference of Source and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04792)
*Gabriel Missael Barco,Ronan Legin,Connor Stone,Yashar Hezaveh,Laurence Perreault-Levasseur*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper proposes relaxing the assumption of known lens mass distribution in strong gravitational lensing through a joint inference method for source and lens profile using score-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in strong gravitational lensing studies where the lens mass distribution is assumed to be known, thus enabling more accurate posterior inference with a less restrictive assumption.

Method: The authors employ a sampler based on GibbsDDRM, adapted to operate in continuous time, for joint inference of the galaxy source and parametric lens-mass profile.

Result: Reconstructions demonstrate residuals consistent with observational noise, and the marginal posteriors of the inferred lens parameters align with true values without systematic bias.

Conclusion: This work showcases the first successful application of a score-based model as a prior for joint inference of both the source and lens in strong gravitational lensing, improving upon prior assumptions.

Abstract: Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific
inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior
inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged
observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution
(and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly
inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based
on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions
yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal
posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint
source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAMAS, a benchmark for evaluating safety and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, showcasing vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and offering tools to improve defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding and evaluating the safety and security of multi-agent LLM systems, which are increasingly used for complex tasks.

Method: The authors designed TAMAS, a benchmark containing scenarios with adversarial and harmless tasks to simulate attacks and operational challenges, evaluating different LLMs and interaction configurations.

Result: The evaluation highlighted that current multi-agent LLM systems face significant vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, with findings detailed using the new Effective Robustness Score (ERS).

Conclusion: TAMAS provides a systematic foundation to study and enhance the safety of multi-agent LLM systems, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses against adversarial challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as
autonomous agents through tool use, planning, and decision-making abilities,
leading to their widespread adoption across diverse tasks. As task complexity
grows, multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly used to solve problems
collaboratively. However, safety and security of these systems remains largely
under-explored. Existing benchmarks and datasets predominantly focus on
single-agent settings, failing to capture the unique vulnerabilities of
multi-agent dynamics and co-ordination. To address this gap, we introduce
$\textbf{T}$hreats and $\textbf{A}$ttacks in $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent
$\textbf{S}$ystems ($\textbf{TAMAS}$), a benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness and safety of multi-agent LLM systems. TAMAS includes five distinct
scenarios comprising 300 adversarial instances across six attack types and 211
tools, along with 100 harmless tasks. We assess system performance across ten
backbone LLMs and three agent interaction configurations from Autogen and
CrewAI frameworks, highlighting critical challenges and failure modes in
current multi-agent deployments. Furthermore, we introduce Effective Robustness
Score (ERS) to assess the tradeoff between safety and task effectiveness of
these frameworks. Our findings show that multi-agent systems are highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses. TAMAS provides a foundation for systematically studying and improving
the safety of multi-agent LLM systems.

### [252] [Training and Testing with Multiple Splits: A Central Limit Theorem for Split-Sample Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04957)
*Bruno Fava*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in predictive algorithm evaluation using sample-splitting and proposes an improved, reproducible inference approach using multiple splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and reproducibility of predictive model evaluation and inference, particularly addressing drawbacks of sample-splitting such as inefficiency and varying estimates.

Method: The paper develops an inference approach leveraging averaging across multiple splits, proves a central limit theorem for split-sample estimators, accounts for statistical dependence, and introduces measures for reproducibility and improved power.

Result: The proposed method enhances model evaluation by improving statistical significance, reproducibility, and inference for applications such as poverty prediction and heterogeneous treatment effects.

Conclusion: The new inference methods allow for more efficient use of data, valid statistical confidence intervals, and improved reproducibility, benefiting research fields like development and public economics.

Abstract: As predictive algorithms grow in popularity, using the same dataset to both
train and test a new model has become routine across research, policy, and
industry. Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using
separate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this
approach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and
different splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across
multiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for
training, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I
address the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by
proving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample
estimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no
restrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence
intervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications,
but may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the
performance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such
cases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I
provide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample
estimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in
development and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous
treatment effects in randomized experiments. I show that my inference approach
with repeated cross-fitting achieves better power than previous alternatives,
often enough to find statistical significance that would otherwise be missed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent events like Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine emphasize the need to understand supply chain shocks, which requires effective modeling tools.

Method: The authors propose using GPUs and automatic differentiation to calibrate agent-based models, improving computation efficiency.

Result: Empirical testing shows that calibration speed-ups over 3 orders of magnitude are achievable compared to conventional baselines.

Conclusion: These advancements make ABMs more scalable, enabling modeling of entire global supply networks.

Abstract: Modelling how shocks propagate in supply chains is an increasingly important
challenge in economics. Its relevance has been highlighted in recent years by
events such as Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Agent-based models
(ABMs) are a promising approach for this problem. However, calibrating them is
hard. We show empirically that it is possible to achieve speed ups of over 3
orders of magnitude when calibrating ABMs of supply networks by running them on
GPUs and using automatic differentiation, compared to non-differentiable
baselines. This opens the door to scaling ABMs to model the whole global supply
network.

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI-powered methodology for auditing academic citations, improving accuracy and efficiency in reference verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current academic citation verification processes are error-prone, with manual methods taking too much time and effort. A faster and more reliable solution is needed.

Method: The authors developed an AI-powered reference auditing system utilizing agentic AI with tool-use capabilities, implementing a zero-assumption protocol that independently verifies every citation using academic databases.

Result: The methodology achieved a 91.7% average verification rate, dramatically reduced auditing times (e.g., 90 minutes for a 916-reference doctoral thesis), and detected critical citation issues with <0.5% false positive rate.

Conclusion: This system provides the first validated AI-driven solution for academic citation integrity, demonstrating significant time savings and reliable detection of issues for diverse users in academia.

Abstract: Academic citation integrity faces persistent challenges, with research
indicating 20% of citations contain errors and manual verification requiring
months of expert time. This paper presents a novel AI-powered methodology for
systematic, comprehensive reference auditing using agentic AI with tool-use
capabilities. We develop a zero-assumption verification protocol that
independently validates every reference against multiple academic databases
(Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, CrossRef) without assuming any citation is
correct. The methodology was validated across 30 academic documents (2,581
references) spanning undergraduate projects to doctoral theses and
peer-reviewed publications. Results demonstrate 91.7% average verification rate
on published PLOS papers, with successful detection of fabricated references,
retracted articles, orphan citations, and predatory journals. Time efficiency
improved dramatically: 90-minute audits for 916-reference doctoral theses
versus months of manual review. The system achieved <0.5% false positive rate
while identifying critical issues manual review might miss. This work
establishes the first validated AI-agent methodology for academic citation
integrity, demonstrating practical applicability for supervisors, students, and
institutional quality assurance.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the generalization error of models using fixed features with a trainable readout, providing a closed-form expression and insights for recurrent representations like Echo-State Networks (ESNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generalization error of models with fixed feature representation and a trainable readout layer, and to explore their performance using Random Matrix Theory and recurrent architectures.

Method: High-dimensional Random Matrix Theory is used to derive a closed-form expression for the generalization error, specifically analyzing recurrent representations and linear echo-state networks.

Result: The study finds that ESNs act as ridge regression with a time-weighted input covariance, showing biases toward recent inputs; ESNs perform well in low-sample, short-memory scenarios, while ridge regression outperforms in large data and long-memory cases.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework for analyzing overparameterized models and explains performance characteristics of deep random-feature models and recurrent dynamics for varying memory and sample conditions.

Abstract: We first study the generalization error of models that use a fixed feature
representation (frozen intermediate layers) followed by a trainable readout
layer. This setting encompasses a range of architectures, from deep
random-feature models to echo-state networks (ESNs) with recurrent dynamics.
Working in the high-dimensional regime, we apply Random Matrix Theory to derive
a closed-form expression for the asymptotic generalization error. We then apply
this analysis to recurrent representations and obtain concise formula that
characterize their performance. Surprisingly, we show that a linear ESN is
equivalent to ridge regression with an exponentially time-weighted (''memory'')
input covariance, revealing a clear inductive bias toward recent inputs.
Experiments match predictions: ESNs win in low-sample, short-memory regimes,
while ridge prevails with more data or long-range dependencies. Our methodology
provides a general framework for analyzing overparameterized models and offers
insights into the behavior of deep learning networks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses parameter inference for the Poisson canonical polyadic (PCP) model using latent-variable methodology, introducing non-iterative estimators and leveraging Fisher information for insights into model properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on addressing issues of parameter inference and model well-posedness in PCP tensor models, aiming to understand the role of tensor rank in identifiability and indeterminacy.

Method: The authors use a latent-variable formulation by considering a higher-dimensional unobservable random tensor, derive non-iterative estimators, and analyze Fisher information matrices to assess model properties.

Result: The paper successfully identifies non-iterative estimators and demonstrates their connection to existing algorithms while providing Fisher information analysis insights into model structure and rank dependencies.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies inference for the PCP model, enhances understanding of tensor model properties, and improves awareness of rank-related identifiability issues.

Abstract: We establish parameter inference for the Poisson canonical polyadic (PCP)
tensor model through a latent-variable formulation. Our approach exploits the
observation that any random PCP tensor can be derived by marginalizing an
unobservable random tensor of one dimension larger. The loglikelihood of this
larger dimensional tensor, referred to as the "complete" loglikelihood, is
comprised of multiple rank one PCP loglikelihoods. Using this methodology, we
first derive non-iterative maximum likelihood estimators for the PCP model and
demonstrate that several existing algorithms for fitting non-negative matrix
and tensor factorizations are Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Next, we
derive the observed and expected Fisher information matrices for the PCP model.
The Fisher information provides us crucial insights into the well-posedness of
the tensor model, such as the role that tensor rank plays in identifiability
and indeterminacy. For the special case of rank one PCP models, we demonstrate
that these results are greatly simplified.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper investigates non-asymptotic efficiency guarantees for tensor decomposition-based inference in count data models, focusing on parametric inference and canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide efficient and accurate methodologies for multiway tensor analysis and parametric inference in count data frameworks.

Method: The study employs a rank-constrained maximum likelihood estimator for tensor decomposition and analyzes its efficiency under Poisson frameworks, considering both rank-one and higher-rank scenarios.

Result: The rank-one estimator achieves near-optimal multiway analysis with variance almost matching the Cramér-Rao lower bound, while results for higher-rank settings are less efficient but still improve upon previous approaches.

Conclusion: Rank-constrained tensor estimators enable near-efficient inference in rank-one settings, and while higher-rank cases show an efficiency gap, they remain highly favorable compared to prior methods.

Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic efficiency guarantees for tensor
decomposition-based inference in count data models. Under a Poisson framework,
we consider two related goals: (i) parametric inference, the estimation of the
full distributional parameter tensor, and (ii) multiway analysis, the recovery
of its canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition factors. Our main result shows
that in the rank-one setting, a rank-constrained maximum-likelihood estimator
achieves multiway analysis with variance matching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower
Bound (CRLB) up to absolute constants and logarithmic factors. This provides a
general framework for studying "near-efficient" multiway estimators in
finite-sample settings. For higher ranks, we illustrate that our multiway
estimator may not attain the CRLB; nevertheless, CP-based parametric inference
remains nearly minimax optimal, with error bounds that improve on prior work by
offering more favorable dependence on the CP rank. Numerical experiments
corroborate near-efficiency in the rank-one case and highlight the efficiency
gap in higher-rank scenarios.

Motivation: To assess the potential of neural networks in decoding brain activity into intelligible speech, facilitating advancements in brain-computer interfaces for communication.

Method: EEG data was mapped to audio representations using a contrastive loss strategy derived from a pre-trained transformer speech model, combined with architectural adjustments: subject-specific attention, personalized spatial attention, and dual-path RNN with attention.

Result: Two architectural modifications (subject-specific attention and personalized spatial attention) improved decoding performance, with WER improvements of +0.15% and +0.45%, respectively, while the dual-path RNN modification (-1.87%) hindered performance.

Conclusion: Personalized architectures enhance brain-to-speech decoding accuracy, showcasing potential applications in brain-computer interface technology.

Abstract: We explore whether neural networks can decode brain activity into speech by
mapping EEG recordings to audio representations. Using EEG data recorded as
subjects listened to natural speech, we train a model with a contrastive CLIP
loss to align EEG-derived embeddings with embeddings from a pre-trained

from Meta, we introduce three architectural modifications: (i) subject-specific
attention layers (+0.15% WER improvement), (ii) personalized spatial attention
(+0.45%), and (iii) a dual-path RNN with attention (-1.87%). Two of the three
modifications improved performance, highlighting the promise of personalized

Motivation: To address the gap in speech emotion recognition models capable of handling both categorical and dimensional emotion modeling across multilingual Southeast Asian languages.

Method: The model employs a hybrid training objective using weighted categorical cross-entropy and Concordance Correlation Coefficient losses, capturing both discrete emotional categories and dimensional emotions.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the model outperforms open-source speech encoders and Audio-LLMs across multilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: MERaLiON-SER demonstrates specialized speech-only models' effectiveness in accurate paralinguistic understanding and cross-lingual generalization, providing a foundation for empathetic multimodal systems.

Abstract: We present MERaLiON-SER, a robust speech emotion recognition model de- signed
for English and Southeast Asian languages. The model is trained using a hybrid
objective combining weighted categorical cross-entropy and Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) losses for joint discrete and dimensional emotion
modelling. This dual approach enables the model to capture both the distinct
categories of emotion (like happy or angry) and the fine-grained, such as
arousal (intensity), valence (positivity/negativity), and dominance (sense of
control), lead- ing to a more comprehensive and robust representation of human
affect. Extensive evaluations across multilingual Singaporean languages
(English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil ) and other public benchmarks show that
MERaLiON-SER consistently surpasses both open-source speech encoders and large
Audio-LLMs. These results underscore the importance of specialised speech-only
models for accurate paralin- guistic understanding and cross-lingual
generalisation. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a foundation for
integrating emotion-aware perception into future agentic audio systems,
enabling more empathetic and contextually adaptive multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training approach for autoencoders that reconstruct inputs from noised encodings, refining their perceptual hierarchy, and improving latent diffusion in music prediction and EEG response tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve how autoencoders represent perceptual hierarchies by restructuring the encoding process and testing applications in music-related tasks.

Method: Autoencoders are trained to reconstruct inputs from disturbed versions of their encodings, combined with perceptual loss mechanisms.

Result: The trained autoencoders demonstrate perceptually salient hierarchical encoding, improving latent diffusion decoding for music pitch estimation and EEG-brain response predictions.

Conclusion: This structured perceptual hierarchy enhances model performance in music applications, and pretrained models are openly shared for further research.

Abstract: We argue that training autoencoders to reconstruct inputs from noised
versions of their encodings, when combined with perceptual losses, yields
encodings that are structured according to a perceptual hierarchy. We
demonstrate the emergence of this hierarchical structure by showing that, after
training an audio autoencoder in this manner, perceptually salient information
is captured in coarser representation structures than with conventional
training. Furthermore, we show that such perceptual hierarchies improve latent
diffusion decoding in the context of estimating surprisal in music pitches and
predicting EEG-brain responses to music listening. Pretrained weights are

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved neural audio fingerprinting methods utilizing pretrained music models and enhanced data augmentation to handle diverse audio manipulations, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern media platforms, like TikTok, often host distorted and manipulated music, necessitating robust techniques to trace the origins of musical recordings.

Method: The authors employ pretrained music foundation models and implement diverse audio manipulations for data augmentation to train fingerprint models, comparing their approach to state-of-the-art models.

Result: Their methods outperform traditional models in robustness and precision, especially in localizing fingerprint matches, which aids in catalog management.

Conclusion: Using music-specific pretrained models and systematic manipulations in training enhances the accuracy and robustness of audio fingerprinting for practical applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of distorted, compressed, and manipulated music on modern
media platforms like TikTok motivates the development of more robust audio
fingerprinting techniques to identify the sources of musical recordings. In
this paper, we develop and evaluate new neural audio fingerprinting techniques
with the aim of improving their robustness. We make two contributions to neural
fingerprinting methodology: (1) we use a pretrained music foundation model as
the backbone of the neural architecture and (2) we expand the use of data
augmentation to train fingerprinting models under a wide variety of audio
manipulations, including time streching, pitch modulation, compression, and
filtering. We systematically evaluate our methods in comparison to two
state-of-the-art neural fingerprinting models: NAFP and GraFPrint. Results show
that fingerprints extracted with music foundation models (e.g., MuQ, MERT)
consistently outperform models trained from scratch or pretrained on
non-musical audio. Segment-level evaluation further reveals their capability to
accurately localize fingerprint matches, an important practical feature for
catalog management.

Motivation: To prepare for and study future distributed quantum computing architectures within high-performance computing systems.

Method: Developing an open-source DQC emulator (CUNQA) capable of simulating three communication models: no-communication, classical-communication, and quantum-communication.

Result: CUNQA successfully demonstrates and analyzes DQC models using the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm.

Conclusion: CUNQA provides a unique and practical tool for evaluating DQC in HPC environments, contributing to research and preparation for real-world applications.

Abstract: The challenge of scaling quantum computers to gain computational power is
expected to lead to architectures with multiple connected quantum processing
units (QPUs), commonly referred to as Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC). In
parallel, there is a growing momentum toward treating quantum computers as
accelerators, integrating them into the heterogeneous architectures of
high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This work combines these two
foreseeable futures in CUNQA, an open-source DQC emulator designed for HPC
environments that allows testing, evaluating and studying DQC in HPC before it
even becomes real. It implements the three DQC models of no-communication,
classical-communication and quantum-communication; which will be examined in
this work. Addressing programming considerations, explaining emulation and
simulation details, and delving into the specifics of the implementation will
be part of the effort. The well-known Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm
is used to demonstrate and analyze the emulation of the models. To the best of
our knowledge, CUNQA is the first tool designed to emulate the three DQC

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for global optimization is proposed, utilizing quantum circuits and evolutionary operators to optimize real-valued functions. Superposition and entanglement mechanisms improve convergence and robustness of the algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance global optimization techniques by leveraging quantum mechanics properties such as superposition and entanglement.

Method: Quantum circuits represent individuals, with measurement outcomes decoded into real-valued vectors. Evolutionary operators act on circuit structures, evaluating fitness through quantum sampling. Comparisons were made regarding gate sets with/without the Hadamard gate, and inter-individual entanglement was explored.

Result: Superposition improves convergence and robustness across benchmarks, and entanglement accelerates convergence, demonstrating optimization advantages through quantum effects.

Conclusion: Gate-based QGAs utilize quantum properties effectively, establishing them as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced global optimization.

Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued
global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum
circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors
through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit
structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based
encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced,
enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution.
Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of
measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the
impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard
gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and
robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual
entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that
quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization
advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and
entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms,
establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced
global optimization.

TL;DR: QCircuitBench is introduced as the first benchmark dataset to evaluate AI in quantum algorithm design and implementation, featuring a comprehensive dataset and automated validation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum algorithm design is challenging due to the complexity of quantum mechanics and lack of tailored datasets for AI to facilitate the process.

Method: The authors introduce QCircuitBench, a dataset with 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. It includes a general framework for quantum algorithm design and automatic validation and verification tools.

Result: Preliminary fine-tuning shows QCircuitBench has potential as a training dataset. However, consistent LLM error patterns were observed, and fine-tuning did not always outperform few-shot learning.

Conclusion: QCircuitBench is a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs in quantum algorithm design but also exposes limitations in LLM performance for this domain.

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup
it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However,
designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the
complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over
quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a
lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we
introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's
capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum
programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task
is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key
contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features
of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for
quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3
task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation
and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive
reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training
dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several
interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error
patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all,
QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm
design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.

### [265] [DAFM: Dynamic Adaptive Fusion for Multi-Model Collaboration in Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05020)
*Yawei Cai,Jiapeng Mi,Nan Ji,Haotian Rong,Yawei Zhang,Zhangti Li,Wenbin Guo,Rensong Xie*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) to improve composed image retrieval by combining strengths of different models, addressing limitations of single-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in composed image retrieval where single-model methods struggle with details and lack dynamic weight allocation, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) leverages collaborative efforts of multiple models, dynamically adjusting their contributions to improve feature fusion and retrieval accuracy.

Result: DAFM shows significant improvement in retrieval benchmarks, achieving higher Recall@10 and Rmean on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: Dynamic multi-model collaboration with DAFM proves effective for composed image retrieval, offering robust and generalizable solutions.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve
target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a
modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform
feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major
challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny
details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same
weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and
text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive
leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts
away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for
multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in
isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models
and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes
retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent
of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments
on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our
method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an
average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up
to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides
an effective and general solution for CIR.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline integrating smoothing B-splines with DiffVG, enabling smooth and stylized vector graphics generation across methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs and enhance stylization control in vector graphics generation.

Method: Smoothing B-splines are integrated using linear mapping within a DiffVG pipeline, leveraging derivative-based smoothing costs.

Result: The approach supports compatibility with recent vector graphics methods and demonstrates application versatility in stylized graphics generation.

Conclusion: The technique proves effective in enabling advanced stylization and smooth path generation, showcasing broad potential for creative vector graphics applications.

Abstract: We integrate smoothing B-splines into a standard differentiable vector
graphics (DiffVG) pipeline through linear mapping, and show how this can be
used to generate smooth and arbitrarily long paths within image-based deep
learning systems. We take advantage of derivative-based smoothing costs for
parametric control of fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs, while also enabling
stylization control in geometric and image spaces. The proposed pipeline is
compatible with recent vector graphics generation and vectorization methods. We
demonstrate the versatility of our approach with four applications aimed at the
generation of stylized vector graphics: stylized space-filling path generation,
stroke-based image abstraction, closed-area image abstraction, and stylized
text generation.

*Jiuqi Yan,Chendong Xu,Dongyu Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces PECL, a novel radar-based network for medical applications, achieving high accuracy by leveraging multiple radar signal domains and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radar systems for medical applications struggle with action classification due to the reliance on single-domain signals and overlooking temporal dependencies in human activities.

Method: The authors designed PECL (Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM), which processes data across multiple radar domains and uses attention mechanisms and temporal units to improve feature extraction and sequence dynamics.

Result: PECL achieved a 96.16% accuracy rate, surpassing existing methods by at least 4.78% while effectively distinguishing between similar actions with moderate model complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed PECL network offers a robust, parameter-efficient solution for radar-based human activity recognition, combining high accuracy with low computational cost.

Abstract: Radar systems are increasingly favored for medical applications because they
provide non-intrusive monitoring with high privacy and robustness to lighting
conditions. However, existing research typically relies on single-domain radar
signals and overlooks the temporal dependencies inherent in human activity,
which complicates the classification of similar actions. To address this issue,
we designed the Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM (PECL) network to process data
in three complementary domains: Range-Time, Doppler-Time, and Range-Doppler.
PECL combines a channel-spatial attention module and temporal units to capture
more features and dynamic dependencies during action sequences, improving both
accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that PECL achieves an
accuracy of 96.16% on the same dataset, outperforming existing methods by at
least 4.78%. PECL also performs best in distinguishing between easily confused
actions. Despite its strong performance, PECL maintains moderate model
complexity, with 23.42M parameters and 1324.82M FLOPs. Its parameter-efficient
design further reduces computational cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of storage I/O challenges in Fully Homomorphic Encryption applications and its impact on performance.

Method: Performance analysis of storage I/O on FHE applications across different hardware setups (ASICs and GPUs).

Result: Storage I/O degrades performance by up to 357x in ASICs and 22x in GPUs.

Conclusion: Proper consideration of storage I/O is essential to optimize the performance of FHE applications and hardware solutions.

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed on

*Xingzhi Zhang,Buyi Lv,Yimin Lu,Kai Bu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PhantomFetch introduces a defense against side-channel attacks exploiting IP-stride prefetchers, maintaining prefetching benefits without requiring costly hardware changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the security concerns posed by IP-stride prefetcher without sacrificing performance or requiring hardware modification.

Method: PhantomFetch breaks the connection between prefetcher entries and secret-dependent loads through obfuscation, ensuring security without hardware remanufacture.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PhantomFetch secures IP-stride prefetchers effectively with negligible performance overhead.

Conclusion: PhantomFetch represents a practical, hardware-agnostic solution to secure prefetchers, enabling compatibility with existing devices while preserving performance.

Abstract: The IP-stride prefetcher has recently been exploited to leak secrets through
side-channel attacks. It, however, cannot be simply disabled for security with
prefetching speedup as a sacrifice. The state-of-the-art defense tries to
retain the prefetching effect by hardware modification. In this paper, we
present PhantomFetch as the first prefetching-retentive and hardware-agnostic
defense. It avoids potential remanufacturing cost and enriches applicability to
off-the-shelf devices. The key idea is to directly break the exploitable
coupling between trained prefetcher entries and the victim's secret-dependent
loads by obfuscating the sensitive load effects of the victim. The experiment
results show that PhantomFetch can secure the IP-stride prefetcher with only
negligible overhead.

*Romain Lefeuvre,Charly Reux,Stefano Zacchiroli,Olivier Barais,Benoit Combemale*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the overlooked issue of vulnerabilities propagating through repository forks beyond their patching in the parent project.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in detecting vulnerabilities that propagate through forked repositories, which are not covered by current vulnerability analysis approaches.

Method: Utilizing commit-level tracing with the global graph of public code in the Software Heritage archive to automate the detection of vulnerabilities and analyze their impact in forked repositories.

Result: Analyzed 7162 repositories from OSV, identifying 2.2M forks with at least one vulnerable commit, strictly filtering to 356 impactful cases. Manual evaluation of 65 pairs revealed 3 high-severity vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The method proves effective in identifying and analyzing one-day vulnerabilities in forked repositories, indicating significant applicability and impact in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Tracking vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source components is
a well-known challenge, often addressed by tracing the threads of dependency
information. However, vulnerabilities can also propagate through forking: a
repository forked after the introduction of a vulnerability, but before it is
patched, may remain vulnerable in the fork well after being fixed in the
original project. Current approaches for vulnerability analysis lack the
commit-level granularity needed to track vulnerability introductions and fixes
across forks, potentially leaving one-day vulnerabilities undetected. This
paper presents a novel approach to help developers identify one-day
vulnerabilities in forked repositories. Leveraging the global graph of public
code, as captured by the Software Heritage archive, the approach propagates
vulnerability information at the commit level and performs automated impact
analysis. This enables automatic detection of forked projects that have not
incorporated fixes, leaving them potentially vulnerable. Starting from 7162
repositories that, according to OSV, include vulnerable commits in their
development histories, we identify 2.2 M forks, containing at least one
vulnerable commit. Then we perform a strict filtering, allowing us to find 356
___vulnerability, fork___ pairs impacting active and popular GitHub forks, we
manually evaluate 65 pairs, finding 3 high-severity vulnerabilities,
demonstrating the impact and applicability of this approach.

*Rishi Rajesh Shah,Chen Henry Wu,Shashwat Saxena,Ziqian Zhong,Alexander Robey,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NINJA, a method to jailbreak long-context language models (LMs) by manipulating the position of harmful user goals within large input contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address safety vulnerabilities in long-context language models with extended capabilities, which are increasingly used in complex tasks.

Method: The NINJA method involves appending benign content to harmful user goals, strategically positioning these goals to exploit LMs' vulnerabilities. Tests were conducted using the HarmBench safety benchmark.

Result: Experiments revealed that NINJA increases attack success rates across cutting-edge models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. It is efficient, transferable, and less detectable compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights that safety risks in modern long-context language models arise from vulnerabilities in handling large input contexts, suggesting significant implications for their deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled
million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like
computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts
remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for
Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by
appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to
our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an
important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench,
show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across
state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource,
transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is
compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can
outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These
findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful
goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.

### [272] [SWAP: Towards Copyright Auditing of Soft Prompts via Sequential Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04711)
*Wenyuan Yang,Yichen Sun,Changzheng Chen,Zhixuan Chu,Jiaheng Zhang,Yiming Li,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SWAP,' a sequential watermarking method for protecting copyright of soft prompts in vision-language models like CLIP. It addresses shortcomings of existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Copyright enforcement for soft prompts in vision-language models like CLIP is crucial but challenging due to the unique characteristics of prompt learning.

Method: The proposed method, SWAP, embeds watermarks in a complex, out-of-distribution decision space inspired by CLIP's zero-shot prediction capabilities. It uses a specific class order to encode the watermark and includes a hypothesis-test-guided verification protocol.

Result: SWAP effectively protects soft prompt copyrights while maintaining prediction label integrity. It shows harmlessness, robustness, and effectiveness against adaptive attacks across experiments on 11 datasets.

Conclusion: SWAP offers a novel, effective approach to soft prompt copyright protection by embedding watermarks in a more complex space, overcoming the limitations of existing auditing techniques.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models, especially CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable performance across diverse downstream tasks. Soft prompts, as
carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to
specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we
investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious
third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed
as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing
techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics.
Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent
models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive
approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed
functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to
prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that
these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason:
watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet
pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential
watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a
different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific
order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the
zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a
more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it
less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided
verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success
conditions. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate SWAP's
effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper pioneers the study of membership inference attacks on cognitive diagnosis models by introducing a grey-box threat model and a novel attack framework, P-MIA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address privacy risks in cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) used in education platforms, focusing on the lack of investigation into membership inference attacks (MIA) within this domain.

Method: The authors introduce a grey-box threat model that utilizes exposed internal knowledge state vectors visible in visualizations like radar charts. They propose P-MIA, a framework that utilizes prediction probabilities and internal state vectors.

Result: Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the grey-box attack surpasses traditional black-box attacks in effectiveness. P-MIA is also shown to audit machine unlearning techniques, exposing their limitations.

Conclusion: This research highlights critical privacy vulnerabilities in CDMs and underscores the effectiveness of grey-box attacks while providing a valuable auditing mechanism for privacy-preserving techniques.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are pivotal for creating fine-grained
learner profiles in modern intelligent education platforms. However, these
models are trained on sensitive student data, raising significant privacy
concerns. While membership inference attacks (MIA) have been studied in various
domains, their application to CDMs remains a critical research gap, leaving
their privacy risks unquantified. This paper is the first to systematically
investigate MIA against CDMs. We introduce a novel and realistic grey box
threat model that exploits the explainability features of these platforms,
where a model's internal knowledge state vectors are exposed to users through
visualizations such as radar charts. We demonstrate that these vectors can be
accurately reverse-engineered from such visualizations, creating a potent
attack surface. Based on this threat model, we propose a profile-based MIA
(P-MIA) framework that leverages both the model's final prediction
probabilities and the exposed internal knowledge state vectors as features.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets against mainstream CDMs show
that our grey-box attack significantly outperforms standard black-box
baselines. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of P-MIA as an auditing tool by
successfully evaluating the efficacy of machine unlearning techniques and
revealing their limitations.

*Daniyal Ganiuly,Assel Smaiyl*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF) to evaluate phishing detectors based on calibration, consistency, and robustness, introducing a Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI) and Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric. GPT-4 demonstrates the strongest trust profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for more reliable and trust-aware assessments of phishing email detectors, beyond just measuring benchmark performance, in order to improve real-world deployment of security systems using large language models.

Method: The authors introduced the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF) which evaluates phishing detectors based on calibration, consistency, and robustness. They further developed the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI) and Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) for these assessments.

Result: Experiments using datasets like SecureMail 2025 and Enron-Spam showed that GPT-4 has the strongest trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and DeBERTa-v3-base, highlighting a discrepancy between accuracy and reliability.

Conclusion: The framework enables transparent and reproducible evaluations of phishing detection models, emphasizing trustworthiness as a pivotal aspect of reliability in deployment.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a persistent challenge to online
communication, exploiting human trust and evading automated filters through
realistic language and adaptive tactics. While large language models (LLMs)
such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification,
their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond
benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the
Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for
evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration,
consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded
index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the
Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of
trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as
SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario,
using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves
the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and
DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies
independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware
evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a
transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in
LLM-based phishing detection.

*Amr Gomaa,Ahmed Salem,Sahar Abdelnabi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConVerse, a benchmark to evaluate privacy and security risks in interactions between autonomous agents, revealing persistent vulnerabilities in multi-agent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As language models transition into autonomous agents interacting within multi-agent ecosystems, ensuring safety in agent-to-agent interactions becomes crucial due to the trade-off between collaboration (requiring information sharing) and minimizing security/privacy risks.

Method: The authors developed ConVerse, a benchmark with three domains (travel, real estate, insurance), 12 user personas, and over 864 contextually grounded attacks to test vulnerabilities via multi-turn agent-to-agent conversations. Privacy risks are assessed through abstraction taxonomy, while security risks focus on tool misuse and influence manipulation.

Result: ConVerse testing on seven state-of-the-art models found vulnerabilities, with privacy attacks succeeding in up to 88% and security breaches in up to 60% of cases. Stronger models exhibited higher information leakage.

Conclusion: ConVerse demonstrates that safety in multi-agent systems is an emergent property of communication, highlighting the trade-offs and persistent risks in balancing privacy, security, and utility.

Abstract: As language models evolve into autonomous agents that act and communicate on
behalf of users, ensuring safety in multi-agent ecosystems becomes a central
challenge. Interactions between personal assistants and external service
providers expose a core tension between utility and protection: effective
collaboration requires information sharing, yet every exchange creates new
attack surfaces. We introduce ConVerse, a dynamic benchmark for evaluating
privacy and security risks in agent-agent interactions. ConVerse spans three
practical domains (travel, real estate, insurance) with 12 user personas and
over 864 contextually grounded attacks (611 privacy, 253 security). Unlike
prior single-agent settings, it models autonomous, multi-turn agent-to-agent
conversations where malicious requests are embedded within plausible discourse.
Privacy is tested through a three-tier taxonomy assessing abstraction quality,
while security attacks target tool use and preference manipulation. Evaluating
seven state-of-the-art models reveals persistent vulnerabilities; privacy
attacks succeed in up to 88% of cases and security breaches in up to 60%, with
stronger models leaking more. By unifying privacy and security within
interactive multi-agent contexts, ConVerse reframes safety as an emergent
property of communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for securing software-defined networks (SDN) while providing smarter traffic control mechanisms.

Method: SmartSecChain-SDN uses machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM for intrusion detection, Hyperledger Fabric for blockchain-based log storage, and application-aware QoS rules for traffic prioritization.

Result: Utilizing the InSDN dataset, the system successfully detects various cyberattacks, ensures bandwidth allocation efficiency, and performs under constrained resources.

Conclusion: SmartSecChain-SDN provides a comprehensive solution for SDN security and network management, showing potential as an innovative and extensible framework for next-generation networks.

Abstract: With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of
traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines
machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs,
and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network
intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the
framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms,
namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is
based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology,
to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus,
guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered
and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service
(QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables
prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and
business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic,
such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios
because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with
controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN
dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and
handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource
constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection,
securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way
to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of
next-generation programmable networks.

*Disesdi Susanna Cox,Niklas Bunzel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating resilience against transferred adversarial attacks in neural networks. A strategic framework using surrogate models and regression-based estimators is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address vulnerabilities of neural networks to transferred adversarial attacks, which pose significant risks in security-related applications.

Method: A targeted framework employing surrogate models selected via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity is proposed for resilience testing against adversarial attacks.

Result: The approach allows optimization of adversarial subspace coverage and realistic risk quantification using regression-based estimators.

Conclusion: It provides organizations with a practical method to quantify and manage risks related to transferred adversarial attacks, overcoming computational limitations.

Abstract: Neural networks have become pervasive across various applications, including
security-related products. However, their widespread adoption has heightened
concerns regarding vulnerability to adversarial attacks. With emerging
regulations and standards emphasizing security, organizations must reliably
quantify risks associated with these attacks, particularly regarding
transferred adversarial attacks, which remain challenging to evaluate
accurately. This paper investigates the complexities involved in resilience
testing against transferred adversarial attacks. Our analysis specifically
addresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to
their practical significance and typically high transferability between neural
network models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively
exploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage. As a
result, comprehensive adversarial risk mapping is deemed impractical. To
mitigate this limitation, we propose a targeted resilience testing framework
that employs surrogate models strategically selected based on Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) similarity. By leveraging surrogate models exhibiting both high
and low CKA similarities relative to the target model, the proposed approach
seeks to optimize coverage of adversarial subspaces. Risk estimation is
conducted using regression-based estimators, providing organizations with
realistic and actionable risk quantification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical framework of language generation and understanding its limitations and capabilities, specifically addressing the validity-breadth trade-off.

Method: The authors use mathematical proofs to establish density bounds and extend the model to analyze how partial enumeration affects language generation and identification.

Result: Achieved a tight bound of 1/2 for language generation density and generalized the bound under partial enumeration while revisiting and characterizing classical language identification models.

Conclusion: This research provides deeper theoretical insights into language generation and identification, resolving key questions and extending foundational models to partial-information scenarios.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has motivated formal theories of
language generation and learning. We study the framework of \emph{language
generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown
language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate
unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible,
and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a
\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve
a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best
achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \emph{partial
enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \subseteq
K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has
lower density $\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least
$\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the
partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor
$1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical
Gold--Angluin model of \emph{language identification} under partial
enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible --
when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \subseteq M \subseteq K$ -- and in
the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization,
showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate
topological space having the $T_D$ separation property.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-based method using photos, field data, and a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for generating geotechnical reports to overcome traditional methods' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geotechnical reports rely on manual observations, which are slow, error-prone, and subjective. There is a need for a faster, more objective, and accurate approach.

Method: Collect photographs and descriptions of rock outcrops, define report outlines, and use iterative prompt refinement with an MLLM to generate report content efficiently without model fine-tuning.

Result: The system achieved BLEU and ROUGE-L scores of 0.455 and 0.653, respectively, demonstrating that the generated reports are comparable to those prepared by experts.

Conclusion: The use of AI for automated geotechnical report generation presents an innovative tool for geologists and students, providing an efficient, accessible, and accurate alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Geotechnical reports are crucial for assessing the stability of rock
formations and ensuring safety in modern engineering. Traditionally, these
reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses,
magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and
subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of
artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of
reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was
based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with
their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the
Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report
outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large
language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and
specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be
an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The
system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and
ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are
comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an
intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats,
represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and
students of field geology.

### [280] [Search Is Not Retrieval: Decoupling Semantic Matching from Contextual Assembly in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04939)
*Harshit Nainwani,Hediyeh Baban*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SINR, a dual-layer architecture for retrieval systems, distinguishing between fine-grained search and coarse-grained retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve retrieval systems by addressing their confusion in separating relevant information retrieval and providing adequate reasoning context.

Method: Presented SINR framework that separates search into fine-grained semantic chunks and retrieval into coarse-grained contextual chunks for enhanced system performance.

Result: The SINR system enhances composability, scalability, and context fidelity without increasing processing costs.

Conclusion: SINR framework transforms traditional retrieval processes, enabling more active and human-like information processing in AI systems.

Abstract: Retrieval systems are essential to contemporary AI pipelines, although most
confuse two separate processes: finding relevant information and giving enough
context for reasoning. We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR)
framework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained
search representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the
composability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by
directly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger,
contextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing
costs. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one,
making the system architecture more like how people process information. We
discuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure,
implementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical
foundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval.

### [281] [Association via Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04901)
*Anthony Gamst,Lawrence Wilson*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'aver' as an alternative to tf-idf for determining associated document pairs, claiming aver performs better in specific scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of tf-idf, particularly in identifying document associations and deficiencies for larger datasets.

Method: Introduces 'aver,' a scoring method based on entropy in a statistical model, and compares its performance against tf-idf through observation and analysis.

Result: Aver outperforms tf-idf in finding associated pairs, offers a threshold for unassociation, applies to larger document sets, and is theoretically more natural.

Conclusion: Aver has advantages in association tasks where tf-idf falls short, though its complexity and interpretation challenges need to be addressed for broader adoption.

Abstract: Prior to recent successes using neural networks, term frequency-inverse
document frequency (tf-idf) was clearly regarded as the best choice for
identifying documents related to a query. We provide a different score, aver,
and observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver
does do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves
finding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where
neural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one
anecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs
as unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs
of documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to
larger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that
aver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a
construction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more
"natural." To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the
aver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact
that the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to
interpret aver scores.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Russian IR datasets from Wikipedia for diverse retrieval tasks and provides insights into retrieval models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create high-quality Russian information retrieval datasets and evaluate retrieval models for improved research.

Method: Develop datasets using Russian Wikipedia with sentence-level relevance and compare retrieval models via experiments.

Result: Lexical retrieval models excel in full-document tasks; neural models perform better on short text tasks. Combining retrieval with neural reranking boosts accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper advances Russian IR resources, underscores model evaluation significance, and publicly shares datasets and implementation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel series of Russian information retrieval
datasets constructed from the "Did you know..." section of Russian Wikipedia.
Our datasets support a range of retrieval tasks, including fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation, and full-document retrieval, by leveraging
interesting facts and their referenced Wikipedia articles annotated at the
sentence level with graded relevance. We describe the methodology for dataset
creation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval
(IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research
by comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art
neural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models.
Results of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural
models on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture
lexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained
retrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of
document length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining
retrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution
expands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and
highlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve
optimal performance. All datasets are publicly available at HuggingFace. To
facilitate reproducibility and future research, we also release the full
implementation on GitHub.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces QUESTER, a Generative Retrieval method reframed as query specification generation using BM25 and a small LLM with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative Retrieval methods struggle with generalization and scalability, requiring innovations to overcome those challenges.

Method: QUESTER uses a small LLM for query specification generation paired with BM25 and is trained using reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO.

Result: QUESTER achieves better effectiveness than BM25 and competes well with neural IR models, maintaining efficiency across evaluations.

Conclusion: Reframing Generative Retrieval as query specification generation allows QUESTER to provide a more effective and efficient alternative in information retrieval.

Abstract: Generative Retrieval (GR) differs from the traditional index-then-retrieve
pipeline by storing relevance in model parameters and directly generating
document identifiers. However, GR often struggles to generalize and is costly
to scale. We introduce QUESTER (QUEry SpecificaTion gEnerative Retrieval),
which reframes GR as query specification generation - in this work, a simple
keyword query handled by BM25 - using a (small) LLM. The policy is trained
using reinforcement learning techniques (GRPO). Across in- and out-of-domain
evaluations, we show that our model is more effective than BM25, and
competitive with neural IR models, while maintaining a good efficiency

*Hyunkyu Kim,Yeeun Yoo,Youngjun Kwak*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to construct domain-specific IR benchmarks using LLM-based query generation, demonstrated through KoBankIR for banking applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IR benchmarks fail to address complex, domain-specific needs in real banking scenarios, and creating new benchmarks is expensive and legally restricted.

Method: The authors propose a methodology involving LLM-based query and multi-document query generation, paired with enhanced answerability assessment techniques for systematic IR benchmark creation.

Result: They developed KoBankIR, an IR benchmark with 815 queries based on 204 official banking documents, revealing challenges existing retrieval models face with complex queries.

Conclusion: Their pipeline offers a promising approach to creating domain-specific IR benchmarks, highlighting the necessity for advanced retrieval methods in the financial sector.

Abstract: As financial applications of large language models (LLMs) gain attention,
accurate Information Retrieval (IR) remains crucial for reliable AI services.
However, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific
information needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR
benchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real
customer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology
for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query
generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline
combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and
reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger
alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology,
we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking
documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with
the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our
systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring
the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains.

### [285] [TeaRAG: A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05385)
*Chao Zhang,Yuhao Wang,Derong Xu,Haoxin Zhang,Yuanjie Lyu,Yuhao Chen,Shuochen Liu,Tong Xu,Xiangyu Zhao,Yan Gao,Yao Hu,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TeaRAG introduces a token-efficient framework for agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), focusing on retrieval-content compression and reasoning step reduction for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RAG systems sacrifice efficiency with substantial token overhead to enhance accuracy in retrieval and reasoning.

Method: TeaRAG compresses retrieved content via chunk-based semantic retrieval enhanced with a graph-based approach and Personalized PageRank. It also reduces reasoning steps using Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO), which evaluates knowledge sufficiency and penalizes excessiveness.

Result: TeaRAG achieves a 4% accuracy improvement and a 61% reduction in output tokens on Llama3-8B-Instruct, and a 2% accuracy improvement with a 59% token reduction on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct across six datasets.

Conclusion: TeaRAG effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in agentic RAG by optimizing retrieval compression and reasoning processes. The framework is publicly accessible for further exploration and usage.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment
Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs
autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although
recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur
substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off
prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes
TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both
retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is
compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval
using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from
semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is
leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of
tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative
Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed.
Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a
knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This
design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative
DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the
average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively. Code is available at

*Pelin Karadal,Dilara Kekulluoglu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study examines how inferred political views influence ChatGPT's responses using personas with different political orientations and investigates the impact of custom instructions and memory features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze ethical concerns like bias and echo chambers arising from ChatGPT's ability to infer user demographics and political views, which affect response personalization.

Method: Using politically-oriented personas, statements were presented to ChatGPT using custom instructions and memory. Subsequently, questions were asked to distinguish variations in worldview and conduct qualitative analysis of responses.

Result: The responses varied according to inferred political perspectives of the personas, demonstrating different reasoning and vocabulary. ChatGPT's outputs leaned leftward, with closer similarity between democratic and neutral personas.

Conclusion: The study highlights how ChatGPT adapts its responses based on inferred political cues, raising potential biases in AI outputs while emphasizing the need for ethical considerations in response personalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) distinguish themselves by quickly delivering
information and providing personalized responses through natural language
prompts. However, they also infer user demographics, which can raise ethical
concerns about bias and implicit personalization and create an echo chamber
effect. This study aims to explore how inferred political views impact the
responses of ChatGPT globally, regardless of the chat session. We also
investigate how custom instruction and memory features alter responses in
ChatGPT, considering the influence of political orientation. We developed three
personas (two politically oriented and one neutral), each with four statements
reflecting their viewpoints on DEI programs, abortion, gun rights, and
vaccination. We convey the personas' remarks to ChatGPT using memory and custom
instructions, allowing it to infer their political perspectives without
directly stating them. We then ask eight questions to reveal differences in
worldview among the personas and conduct a qualitative analysis of the
responses. Our findings indicate that responses are aligned with the inferred
political views of the personas, showing varied reasoning and vocabulary, even
when discussing similar topics. We also find the inference happening with
explicit custom instructions and the implicit memory feature in similar ways.
Analyzing response similarities reveals that the closest matches occur between
the democratic persona with custom instruction and the neutral persona,
supporting the observation that ChatGPT's outputs lean left.

TL;DR: GenAI demands significant energy, posing climate risks. G-TRACE estimates emissions while measuring energy impact, proposing governance frameworks for sustainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the environmental impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and create actionable frameworks for sustainable deployment.

Method: Develop G-TRACE, a region-sensitive tool for estimating emissions and energy impacts of training and inference across modalities, paired with real-world analytics and simulations.

Result: G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon emissions per output type and reveals decentralized inference impacts. Viral trends in generative AI result in substantial energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights GenAI’s climate risks and presents a novel governance model (AI Sustainability Pyramid) to translate emission metrics into policies, aligning technological innovation with sustainability goals.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a rapidly expanding
digital infrastructure whose energy demand and associated CO2 emissions are
emerging as a new category of climate risk. This study introduces G-TRACE
(GenAI Transformative Carbon Estimator), a cross-modal, region-aware framework
that quantifies training- and inference-related emissions across modalities and
deployment geographies. Using real-world analytics and microscopic simulation,
G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon intensity per output type (text, image,
video) and reveals how decentralized inference amplifies small per-query energy
costs into system-level impacts. Through the Ghibli-style image generation
trend (2024-2025), we estimate 4,309 MWh of energy consumption and 2,068 tCO2
emissions, illustrating how viral participation inflates individual digital
actions into tonne-scale consequences. Building on these findings, we propose
the AI Sustainability Pyramid, a seven-level governance model linking carbon
accounting metrics (L1-L7) with operational readiness, optimization, and
stewardship. This framework translates quantitative emission metrics into
actionable policy guidance for sustainable AI deployment. The study contributes
to the quantitative assessment of emerging digital infrastructures as a novel
category of climate risk, supporting adaptive governance for sustainable
technology deployment. By situating GenAI within climate-risk frameworks, the
work advances data-driven methods for aligning technological innovation with
global decarbonization and resilience objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI becoming integral to everyday technology, there is a need for scalable, effective methods to teach AI literacy, especially to non-STEM higher education learners.

Method: The authors developed an interactive curriculum named 'AI User' and conducted four focus groups with instructors using thematic analysis to assess feedback on its usability and instructional materials.

Result: Instructors valued tasks simulating real-world AI use cases but pointed out challenges such as scaffolding, accessibility, and multi-modal support. They preferred interactive demonstrations to traditional materials.

Conclusion: Insights from this study aid in designing AI literacy tools that align with diverse teaching contexts, making AI concepts accessible and engaging for broader audiences in higher education.

Abstract: This research category full paper investigates how community college
instructors evaluate interactive, no-code AI literacy resources designed for
non-STEM learners. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated
into everyday technologies, AI literacy - the ability to evaluate AI systems,
communicate with them, and understand their broader impacts - has emerged as a
critical skill across disciplines. Yet effective, scalable approaches for
teaching these concepts in higher education remain limited, particularly for
students outside STEM fields.
  To address this gap, we developed AI User, an interactive online curriculum
that introduces core AI concepts through scenario - based activities set in
real - world contexts. This study presents findings from four focus groups with
instructors who engaged with AI User materials and participated in structured
feedback activities. Thematic analysis revealed that instructors valued
exploratory tasks that simulated real - world AI use cases and fostered
experimentation, while also identifying challenges related to scaffolding,
accessibility, and multi-modal support. A ranking task for instructional
support materials showed a strong preference for interactive demonstrations
over traditional educational materials like conceptual guides or lecture
slides.
  These findings offer insights into instructor perspectives on making AI
concepts more accessible and relevant for broad learner audiences. They also
inform the design of AI literacy tools that align with diverse teaching
contexts and support critical engagement with AI in higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Support AI literacy among non-STEM learners with accessible teaching tools rather than programming-heavy methods.

Method: Fifteen community college instructors engaged with Projects 5-8 of the curriculum, providing feedback through individual reflection, group discussion, and thematic analysis.

Result: Instructors valued exploratory and role-based activities but identified design trade-offs like cognitive load and adaptability for diverse learners.

Conclusion: Insights inform the creation of inclusive, experiential AI learning tools that are scalable and cater to broad learner backgrounds.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly shapes decision-making across
domains, there is a growing need to support AI literacy among learners beyond
computer science. However, many current approaches rely on programming-heavy
tools or abstract lecture-based content, limiting accessibility for non-STEM
audiences. This paper presents findings from a study of AI User, a modular,
web-based curriculum that teaches core AI concepts through interactive, no-code
projects grounded in real-world scenarios. The curriculum includes eight
projects; this study focuses on instructor feedback on Projects 5-8, which
address applied topics such as natural language processing, computer vision,
decision support, and responsible AI. Fifteen community college instructors
participated in structured focus groups, completing the projects as learners
and providing feedback through individual reflection and group discussion.
Using thematic analysis, we examined how instructors evaluated the design,
instructional value, and classroom applicability of these experiential
activities. Findings highlight instructors' appreciation for exploratory tasks,
role-based simulations, and real-world relevance, while also surfacing design
trade-offs around cognitive load, guidance, and adaptability for diverse
learners. This work extends prior research on AI literacy by centering
instructor perspectives on teaching complex AI topics without code. It offers
actionable insights for designing inclusive, experiential AI learning resources
that scale across disciplines and learner backgrounds.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in AI literacy for non-STEM professionals by introducing a task-oriented assessment model focused on practical AI skills rather than technical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI increasingly enters professional settings, there is a need to make workers AI literate, especially those outside STEM fields. Current methods for measuring AI literacy overly emphasize technical skills and fail to address practical usage in job scenarios.

Method: The authors developed and tested a work-task-oriented AI literacy assessment model in a US Navy robotics training program. This included robotics training, AI literacy instruction, and evaluation using practical competition tasks and scenario-based assessments.

Result: The study found that scenario tasks in the competition, designed to mimic real-world AI application, were more effective in assessing applied AI literacy compared to traditional tests.

Conclusion: Educators should prioritize practical, contextualized skill assessment over abstract technical knowledge when preparing workers without technical backgrounds for AI-integrated roles.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become ubiquitous in professional
contexts, there is an urgent need to equip workers, often with backgrounds
outside of STEM, with the skills to use these tools effectively as well as
responsibly, that is, to be AI literate. However, prevailing definitions and
therefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical
knowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical
knowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying
ethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI
literacy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment
model for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for
effective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development
of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative
assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program
included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with
practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI
in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the
competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past
research or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for
AI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments
that emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract
technical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical
backgrounds for AI-integrated roles.

TL;DR: This paper uses Large Language Models (LLMs) in agent-based simulations to study responses to misinformation across different personas, focusing on trust, polarization, and susceptibility to disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how different population groups react to disinformation, crucial for designing interventions, as real-world experimentation poses challenges ethically and practically.

Method: The authors developed an agent-based simulation leveraging LLMs. Personas across five professions and three mental schemas were modeled, and their responses to news headlines were analyzed.

Result: LLM-generated agents closely matched real-world patterns and human predictions. Mental schemas were found to play a more significant role in interpreting misinformation than professional backgrounds.

Conclusion: The study validates the use of LLMs as agents in models analyzing social dynamics such as trust and polarization, opening opportunities for researching responses in complex information networks.

Abstract: Disinformation campaigns can distort public perception and destabilize
institutions. Understanding how different populations respond to information is
crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation
is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an
agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to
misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three
mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings
show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human
predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information
responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background,
influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation
of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network
for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in
complex social systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a consensus-based algorithm for collaborative personalized mean estimation with privacy constraints, showing faster convergence compared to local approaches with theoretical backing and numerical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data privacy in communication-constrained environments where agents receive data and collaborate under privacy constraints.

Method: A consensus-based algorithm analyzed under the differential privacy framework to ensure data protection while improving convergence in collaborative settings.

Result: The algorithm ensures faster convergence compared to local approaches under privacy and connectivity constraints.

Conclusion: Collaborative private communication enables effective online data processing under privacy and communication restrictions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of communication-constrained collaborative
personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of
several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown
agent-specific distributions. A consensus-based algorithm is studied under the
framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We
give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based
algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing
that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach
where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some
restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which
illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a
communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local
convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results.

Method: Developed a system called Story Arena, where AI agents with predefined positions on software engineering's future collaborated to create a design fiction.

Result: Created 'The Code of Trust,' a narrative exploring human comprehension, trust, content ownership, and human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Design fiction and multi-agent AI collaborations can provide valuable perspectives on the complex dynamics of human-AI co-creation.

Abstract: What better way to understand the impact of AI on software engineering than
to ask AI itself? We constructed Story Arena, a multi-agent "writer's room" in
which multiple AI agents, independently imbued with a position statement on the
future of software engineering, converse with each other to develop a shared
vision. They then use this shared vision to collaboratively construct a design
fiction that depicts this vision in narrative form. We present "The Code of
Trust," a short fiction that investigates themes of human comprehension, trust,
content ownership, augmentation vs. replacement, and uncertain futures in
human-AI co-creation.

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-driven assessment model for enhancing verbal and non-verbal public speaking skills among engineering students, integrating speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of providing sustained, personalized feedback on public speaking for engineering students, a skill vital for their future professional roles.

Method: The study developed a multi-modal AI system assessing verbal communication, non-verbal communication, and expressive coherence, combining speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection.

Result: The AI-generated feedback moderately aligned with expert evaluations, with Gemini Pro performing best among tested AI models in agreement with human annotators.

Conclusion: The AI-driven system allows repeated, scalable, and personalized public speaking training, enabling students to improve their communication skills efficiently without relying on human evaluators.

Abstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge
in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a
necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical
knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or
workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to
students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal
aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and
individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal
and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model
for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer
vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides
assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch,
loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial
expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel
integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike
previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple
modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing
demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert
evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were
Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro
emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human
annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public
speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align
their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and
professional communication.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces 8bit-GPT, a language model simulating a legacy system to provoke reflection on human dependency on AI chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the adverse effects of over-reliance on assistive chatbots, which impact information retention and emotional attachment.

Method: The authors created 8bit-GPT based on a legacy Macintosh OS using reflective design principles like slow technology and counterfunctionality, fostering inefficient interaction to stimulate user reflection.

Result: The 8bit-GPT model creates a deliberately challenging user experience to highlight the tool-like nature of chatbots and encourage critical thinking about human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how alternative design approaches, such as disrupting familiar interaction patterns, can push users to reconsider their dependency on chatbots and the anthropomorphic framing of AI.

Abstract: The proliferation of assistive chatbots offering efficient, personalized
communication has driven widespread over-reliance on them for decision-making,
information-seeking and everyday tasks. This dependence was found to have
adverse consequences on information retention as well as lead to superficial
emotional attachment. As such, this work introduces 8bit-GPT; a language model
simulated on a legacy Macintosh Operating System, to evoke reflection on the
nature of Human-AI interaction and the consequences of anthropomorphic
rhetoric. Drawing on reflective design principles such as slow-technology and
counterfunctionality, this work aims to foreground the presence of chatbots as
a tool by defamiliarizing the interface and prioritizing inefficient
interaction, creating a friction between the familiar and not.

### [296] [LG-NuSegHop: A Local-to-Global Self-Supervised Pipeline For Nuclei Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04892)
*Vasileios Magoulianitis,Catherine A. Alexander,Jiaxin Yang,C. -C. Jay Kuo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LG-NuSegHop, a self-supervised framework for nuclei segmentation in histology images, with strong generalization across datasets using no manually annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating nuclei segmentation in histology images is vital due to its key role in disease diagnosis, but challenges arise from variability in nuclei shapes across organs and the high cost of data annotations.

Method: LG-NuSegHop employs (1) local processing to generate pseudolabels, (2) a novel NuSegHop feature extraction model, and (3) global post-processing, leveraging self-supervised learning methods without requiring annotated training data.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show LG-NuSegHop outperforms self- and weakly-supervised methods and competes effectively with fully supervised approaches.

Conclusion: LG-NuSegHop demonstrates automation potential for nuclei segmentation while being explainable for physicians, offering robust performance without domain adaptation or annotated data.

Abstract: Nuclei segmentation is the cornerstone task in histology image reading,
shedding light on the underlying molecular patterns and leading to disease or
cancer diagnosis. Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from
trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues
and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other
hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL)
models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This
work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised
pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology.
There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to
generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction
model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of
NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually
annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good
generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly
available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and
weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully
supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent
and explainable to physicians.

### [297] [UHDRes: Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration via Dual-Domain Decoupled Spectral Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05009)
*S. Zhao,W. Lu,B. Wang,T. Wang,K. Zhang,H. Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UHDRes, a lightweight framework for restoring ultra-high-definition images affected by severe degradations like blur or haze. UHDRes innovatively improves feature restoration in both the frequency and spatial domains, achieving high performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-high-definition images are often degraded due to challenges such as blur, rain, or low-light, and restoring these images poses significant computational challenges due to their high resolution.

Method: The proposed UHDRes framework leverages dual-domain decoupled spectral modulation, enhancing amplitude in the frequency domain while refining phase information spatially. It integrates spatio-spectral fusion through a multi-scale context aggregator and shared gated feed-forward networks for efficient feature interaction.

Result: UHDRes delivers state-of-the-art ultra-high-definition image restoration performance, requiring only 400K parameters while significantly improving inference speed and reducing memory usage. Extensive experiments validate its success on five public UHD benchmarks.

Conclusion: UHDRes represents a significant advancement in efficient and high-quality UHD image restoration, balancing performance, computational efficiency, and parameter optimization.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images often suffer from severe degradations such
as blur, haze, rain, or low-light conditions, which pose significant challenges
for image restoration due to their high resolution and computational demands.
In this paper, we propose UHDRes, a novel lightweight dual-domain decoupled
spectral modulation framework for UHD image restoration. It explicitly models
the amplitude spectrum via lightweight spectrum-domain modulation, while
restoring phase implicitly through spatial-domain refinement. We introduce the
spatio-spectral fusion mechanism, which first employs a multi-scale context
aggregator to extract local and global spatial features, and then performs
spectral modulation in a decoupled manner. It explicitly enhances amplitude
features in the frequency domain while implicitly restoring phase information
through spatial refinement. Additionally, a shared gated feed-forward network
is designed to efficiently promote feature interaction through shared-parameter
convolutions and adaptive gating mechanisms. Extensive experimental comparisons
on five public UHD benchmarks demonstrate that our UHDRes achieves the
state-of-the-art restoration performance with only 400K parameters, while
significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage. The codes and models
are available at https://github.com/Zhao0100/UHDRes.
