### [1] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the linear model of AI progress and introduces the concepts of "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence," emphasizing that intelligence is nonlinear and multifaceted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prevailing models of AI intelligence, particularly the linear assumption, and to propose a more nuanced understanding of AI capabilities.

Method: The authors conceptualize AI intelligence as nonlinear, developing the notions of "familiar" and "strange" intelligence, while defending a broader definition of general intelligence evaluated across multiple environments and goals.

Result: The paper argues that AI's performance will vary unpredictably between superhuman and subhuman levels across tasks, challenging standardized evaluations and simplistic interpretations of intelligence.

Conclusion: AI intelligence should be assessed in terms of its varied, domain-specific strengths and weaknesses without assuming uniform capacities. Failures in simple tasks don't imply lack of general intelligence, nor does excellent performance in narrow domains assure adaptability across environments.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

### [2] [DeepRead: Document Structure-Aware Reasoning to Enhance Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05014)
*Zhanli Li,Huiwen Tian,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepRead is a new framework for question answering on long documents, leveraging document structure and LLM tools to enhance retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing agentic search frameworks in utilizing document-native features for enhanced reasoning in long-document question answering.

Method: DeepRead utilizes an LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown while preserving heading and paragraph boundaries. It indexes documents at the paragraph level with metadata and introduces tools for locating relevant paragraphs and reading them in order.

Result: The model performs significantly better than standard agentic search frameworks in document question answering, showing human-like reasoning patterns that combine locating and reading.

Conclusion: DeepRead demonstrates the importance of leveraging document structure and complementary tools to improve reasoning and retrieval in long-document question answering.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

### [3] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the MINT framework for optimizing AI-human interactions in object-driven planning under incomplete information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address knowledge gaps in open-world planning problems requiring human-AI interaction.

Method: Develop Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT), leveraging self-play, symbolic reasoning, neural policies, and LLMs to generate optimal queries for eliciting human inputs.

Result: Evaluation across benchmarks shows that MINT achieves near-expert planning performance with minimal human queries, improving rewards and success rates.

Conclusion: MINT effectively bridges knowledge gaps by optimizing AI agent's strategies for human input elicitation, demonstrating strong planning performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

### [4] [Determining Energy Efficiency Sweet Spots in Production LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05695)
*Hiari Pizzini Cavagna,Andrea Proia,Giacomo Madella,Giovanni B. Esposito,Francesco Antici,Daniele Cesarini,Zeynep Kiziltan,Andrea Bartolini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies energy efficiency patterns in LLM inference, proposes an analytical model to predict efficiency based on input/output lengths, and validates it across diverse models and GPUs, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limited accuracy of existing linear models estimating LLM energy consumption, and understand energy usage in modern AI applications.

Method: The authors develop an analytical model based on the Transformer architecture's computational and memory access complexity, and validate it using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and multiple LLMs across varying input and output lengths.

Result: The model achieved a high accuracy of 1.79% mean MAPE in predicting energy consumption and revealed efficiency 'Sweet Spots' that can save energy in production environments.

Conclusion: Optimizing input and output lengths in LLM inference can significantly improve energy efficiency, providing a foundation for strategies like truncation and adaptive generation in AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

### [5] [Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059)
*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates a large language model (LLM)'s ability to perform on graph theory problems, presenting strengths in solved problems but limitations in open problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of LLMs in supporting rigorous mathematical inquiry as they become increasingly integrated into computer science education.

Method: An eight-stage evaluation protocol was conducted, involving interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction with solved and unsolved graph theory problems.

Result: The LLM performed well on solved problems with valid proofs and accurate recall of definitions, but struggled with generating new insights for the open problem while avoiding unsupported claims.

Conclusion: LLMs can aid in exploring established mathematical material but are limited in generating novel insights, calling for guidance in their educational use for rigorous problem-solving.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

### [6] [Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05073)
*Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,To Eun Kim,Jiatong Li,Wendi Li,Samuel Yeh,Xuefeng Du,Hamed Hassani,Paul Bogdan,Dawn Song,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs), arguing it should focus on interactive agents in realistic scenarios rather than single-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety and effectiveness of LLMs in complex applications, there's a need for better UQ approaches tailored to interactive scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a new framework, shifting UQ from uncertainty accumulation to a conditional uncertainty reduction process, emphasizing interactivity.

Result: They develop a conceptual framework to guide the design of UQ setups for LLM agents, providing practical insights and identifying unresolved challenges.

Conclusion: The paper redefines UQ for LLMs in interactive settings, marking a step forward in designing safer and more reliable systems.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

### [7] [Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05075)
*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Gunther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for active debris removal (ADR), integrating adaptive collision avoidance, mission planning, and refueling strategies to optimize small satellite operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing concentration of orbital debris necessitates effective strategies for safe and efficient ADR missions, as traditional approaches struggle with the dynamic nature of in-orbit operations.

Method: The study introduces a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic maneuver adjustments for small satellites across ADR missions. Simulated scenarios are used for validation.

Result: The RL framework decreased collision risk and improved mission efficiency, outperforming traditional heuristic methods in multi-debris removal scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 dataset.

Conclusion: This RL-based framework offers a robust and scalable solution for complex ADR missions, with potential application in other multi-target rendezvous challenges in space.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

### [8] [VERA-MH: Reliability and Validity of an Open-Source AI Safety Evaluation in Mental Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05088)
*Kate H. Bentley,Luca Belli,Adam M. Chekroud,Emily J. Ward,Emily R. Dworkin,Emily Van Ark,Kelly M. Johnston,Will Alexander,Millard Brown,Matt Hawrilenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study validates the VERA-MH evaluation system, demonstrating its safety and reliability in assessing AI chatbots for suicide risk detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the safety of generative AI chatbots being used for mental health support, particularly focusing on suicide risk detection and response.

Method: Simulated conversations between AI chatbots and LLM-based user agents were analyzed, with licensed mental health clinicians and an LLM judge evaluating safety using a rubric. Their ratings were compared for consistency and alignment.

Result: Clinicians' safety ratings were consistent (IRR: 0.77), establishing a clinical gold standard. The LLM judge aligned strongly with clinicians (IRR: 0.81), and user-agents were perceived as realistic by clinicians.

Conclusion: The VERA-MH evaluation system is a valid and reliable tool for assessing AI chatbot safety in mental health applications, though further research is needed on its robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

### [9] [Evaluating Robustness and Adaptability in Learning-Based Mission Planning for Active Debris Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05091)
*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Günther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates three planners for autonomous Active Debris Removal in Low Earth Orbit, investigating their efficiency under dynamics and constraints. Domain-randomized Masked PPO shows improved adaptability compared to nominal PPO at the cost of moderate nominal performance, while Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) remains best for adaptability but is computationally intensive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal, addressing challenges of efficiency, adaptability, and strict operational constraints in low Earth orbit environments.

Method: Three planners were examined: nominal PPO, domain-randomized PPO for robustness, and an MCTS baseline. Evaluations were conducted in high-fidelity simulations incorporating realistic orbital dynamics and refueling across various restrictive scenarios.

Result: Nominal PPO excelled in matching mission parameters but faltered under variability. In contrast, domain-randomized PPO proved more robust to changes but with slightly reduced performance. MCTS showed adaptability across scenarios but at a significant computational cost.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-offs between learned policy efficiency and search-based method adaptability. Combining training diversity with online planning may offer a solution for resilient mission planning.

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

### [10] [GAMMS: Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05105)
*Rohan Patil,Jai Malegaonkar,Xiao Jiang,Andre Dion,Gaurav S. Sukhatme,Henrik I. Christensen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAMMS, a lightweight simulation framework for graph-based environments, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable and accessible simulation tools capable of rapid prototyping and supporting large-scale multi-agent deployments.

Method: GAMMS leverages a graph-based simulation approach, integrating tools for visualization, external library support, and compatibility with various agent policies.

Result: The framework enables efficient simulation of complex domains, supports external integrations, and facilitates agent experimentation on standard hardware.

Conclusion: GAMMS simplifies the development and evaluation of multi-agent systems, paving the way for innovation in autonomous planning and adversarial modeling, and is open-source for broad accessibility.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling. The framework is open-source and available at https://github.com/GAMMSim/GAMMS/

### [11] [Understanding LLM Evaluator Behavior: A Structured Multi-Evaluator Framework for Merchant Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05110)
*Liang Wang,Junpeng Wang,Chin-chia Michael Yeh,Yan Zheng,Jiarui Sun,Xiran Fan,Xin Dai,Yujie Fan,Yiwei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured framework to evaluate the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in merchant risk assessment settings and examines their reliability and biases, revealing heterogeneity among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and bias of LLMs in reasoning tasks, particularly within the domain of payments-risk assessment using Merchant Category Codes (MCC) and to improve evaluative methods for such systems in operational settings.

Method: The paper employs a multi-evaluator framework using a five-criterion rubric combined with Monte-Carlo scoring techniques to assess rationale quality and stability. Evaluations are performed on reasoning generated by multiple LLM models, with anonymized and attributed conditions, and judge-independent references via consensus-deviation metrics.

Result: The study finds variability in biases among different LLM models, with GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet displaying negative bias and Gemini-2.5 Pro along with Grok 4 showing positive bias. The anonymization reduces bias by 25.8%. LLM judges are found to assign scores higher than human consensus (+0.46 points on average). Four models demonstrate significant alignment with ground-truth payment data.

Conclusion: A replicable framework for evaluating LLM reasoning in merchant risk scenarios is proposed, demonstrating alignment with human judgment for some models while highlighting variances in bias and the necessity for bias-aware systems in financial workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

### [12] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Democratic Preference Optimization (DemPO), a method to make AI learning preference-based alignment more demographically representative by using two schemes: Hard Panel and Soft Panel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address bias in AI systems caused by preference-based alignment methods (like RLHF) that rely on non-representative human rater pools, leading to systemic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain demographics.

Method: The authors propose DemPO, which uses algorithmic sortition to create demographically representative training samples. Two schemes are described: Hard Panel (limited to quota-based public samples) and Soft Panel (reweighting raters based on inclusion probability).

Result: Results show that models trained with the Hard Panel outperform others in value alignment, and the Soft Panel also outdoes the unweighted baseline. Larger models observed larger improvements.

Conclusion: Incorporating demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage significantly improves AI model alignment with diverse public values compared to post hoc methods.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

### [13] [SocialVeil: Probing Social Intelligence of Language Agents under Communication Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05115)
*Keyang Xuan,Pengda Wang,Chongrui Ye,Haofei Yu,Tal August,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SocialVeil, a testing environment for assessing LLMs’ behavior in imperfect communication scenarios caused by cognitive-difference barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs assume ideal communication, which limits the ability to examine their performance in realistic, imperfect interactions.

Method: SocialVeil simulates communication barriers (semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, emotional interference) and evaluates LLMs using metrics like unresolved confusion and mutual understanding.

Result: Experiments reveal that communication barriers significantly impair LLM performance, reducing mutual understanding by over 45% and increasing confusion by nearly 50%.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of evaluating LLMs in non-ideal communication settings, offering a novel framework to study and benchmark social intelligence in such conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

*Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Lian Wen,David Chen,Alpha Alimamy Kamara,Zhongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named CAST-CKT aimed at better traffic prediction in scarce and cross-city data scenarios, emphasizing chaos-aware modeling, achieving significant improvements over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of predicting traffic in data-scarce and cross-city environments, considering chaotic dynamics and domain shifts that existing models fail to effectively handle.

Method: CAST-CKT employs a chaos-aware framework featuring a chaotic analyzer, adaptive learning techniques for spatio-temporal modeling and domain alignment, and uncertainty quantification for horizon-specific predictions.

Result: CAST-CKT demonstrates superior performance, notably improving MAE and RMSE metrics in cross-city traffic prediction experiments on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CAST-CKT framework effectively handles chaotic regimes and cross-city predictions, offering accurate and interpretable results, showing substantial improvement over previous methods.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

*Nengbo Wang,Tuo Liang,Vikash Singh,Chaoda Song,Van Yang,Yu Yin,Jing Ma,Jagdip Singh,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HugRAG, a framework for improving graph-based retrieval-augmented generation by incorporating causal modeling and addressing scalability issues in reasoning over large knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based retrieval-augmented generation methods often suffer from over-reliance on surface-level matches, lack explicit causal modeling, and face scalability barriers in reasoning across large knowledge sets.

Method: The proposed HugRAG framework incorporates causal gating across hierarchical modules, enabling scalable and causally accurate reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs.

Result: HugRAG outperformed existing graph-based RAG methods in extensive experiments across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: HugRAG establishes a new standard for structured, scalable, and causally grounded graph-based retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

*Fengxian Chen,Zhilong Tao,Jiaxuan Li,Yunlong Li,Qingguo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domains with multiple knowledge bases by proposing methods to improve evidence traceability, cross-KB verification, and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the problem of handling dense and heterogeneous knowledge bases in Chinese Tibetan medicine, where dense encyclopedia data often dominates retrieval at the cost of authoritative evidence from classics or clinical papers.

Method: The authors propose two methods: DAKS for KB routing and budgeted retrieval to reduce bias, and an alignment graph for evidence fusion to improve cross-KB evidence coverage without naive concatenation. Answers are generated using a lightweight model (openPangu-Embedded-7B).

Result: The experiments demonstrate improved routing quality and evidence coverage across KBs. The system achieves the best CrossEv@5 metric while maintaining alignment to authoritative sources and citation correctness.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses density bias and enables grounded question answering across multiple KBs, providing stronger traceability and reducing hallucinations in generated content.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

### [18] [Surgery: Mitigating Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Attention Sink](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05228)
*Guozhi Liu,Weiwei Lin,Tiansheng Huang,Ruichao Mo,Qi Mu,Xiumin Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of harmful fine-tuning in large language models by introducing a defense mechanism called 'Surgery,' which mitigates the problem via the attention sink mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning of large language models can lead to harmful patterns, invalidating safety measures. The authors aim to prevent these risks by analyzing and addressing harmful patterns during fine-tuning.

Method: The study introduces the concept of 'sink divergence' to observe attention head behaviors during harmful fine-tuning. It presents the 'separable sink divergence hypothesis' and a defense mechanism named 'Surgery,' which applies a regularizer to suppress harmful attention patterns.

Result: The Surgery approach significantly improves safety, achieving defense performance gains of 5.90%, 11.25%, and 9.55% on three benchmarks: BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that monitoring and managing attention head behaviors through sink divergence can effectively defend against harmful fine-tuning, enhancing model safety.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Result: Achieved 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing tumour regions; successfully explained model predictions including partial tumour visibility.

Conclusion: Integrated XAI techniques can improve reliability and interpretability of AI in medical imaging, enhancing transparency and decision-making.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning. The study demonstrates the potential of integrated XAI techniques in improving the reliability and interpretability of AI systems in healthcare, particularly for critical tasks like brain tumour detection.

*Xinyi He,Ying Yang,Chuanjian Fu,Sihan Guo,Songchun Zhu,Lifeng Fan,Zhenliang Zhang,Yujia Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel system, TEA, for dynamically generating contextual tasks in unseen 3D environments to better evaluate embodied intelligent agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing benchmarks, such as data contamination and lack of scene specificity, to improve the evaluation of general intelligent agents in unseen environments.

Method: They introduce the TEA system, which utilizes a two-stage process: interaction-based task generation within environments and evolutionary task graph modeling to create diverse, physically reasonable tasks without external data.

Result: The TEA system created 87,876 tasks across 10 unseen scenes, which human verification confirmed to be valid. Benchmark results showed that state-of-the-art models perform poorly on these in-situ tasks, revealing significant limitations in current agent capabilities.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the urgent need for in-situ evaluation of intelligent agents in unseen environments before their real-world deployment, as current benchmarks fail to capture critical performance aspects.

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

### [21] [Beyond Cosine Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05266)
*Xinbo Ai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces recos, a novel similarity metric improving upon cosine similarity, better modeling complex nonlinear semantic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cosine similarity's linear structure inadequately reflects the intricate nature of real-world semantic spaces.

Method: The authors derive a tighter bound for the dot product than the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, introducing recos, which uses sorted vector components for normalization.

Result: Experiments across 11 embedding models reveal recos consistently outperforms cosine similarity, correlating better with human judgments on semantic benchmarks.

Conclusion: recos is established as a superior and mathematically principled similarity metric for complex embedding spaces.

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil Lupu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in security management tasks through iterative feedback and consistency checks, reducing risks of hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in security management tasks but face challenges such as unreliability and hallucination. The paper aims to address these issues to enable safer deployment.

Method: The authors propose a framework integrating LLMs in iterative loops, where generated actions are checked for consistency and external feedback is incorporated to refine actions through in-context learning.

Result: Experimental evaluation on four datasets shows the framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to existing models, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The developed approach improves security management by controlling hallucinations via consistency thresholds, enabling robust and efficient incident response planning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues against universal foundation models for time series due to conceptual errors and advocates for a causal control paradigm leveraging specialized solvers for better adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address fundamental limitations in universal time-series models failing under distribution drift and generational incompatibilities across domains.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical "Autoregressive Blindness Bound" and emphasize moving from universality to a Causal Control Agent paradigm that orchestrates specialized solvers.

Result: The study demonstrates that monolithic, universal models degenerate under drift and highlights the theoretical limits of history-only models to predict intervention-driven regime shifts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for benchmark shifts that prioritize control-based systems focused on drift adaptation speed rather than zero-shot accuracy.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMR, a novel approach for MOOC recommendation utilizing path-specific semantic embeddings for better accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional and graph-based MOOC recommendations suffering from data sparsity, over-specialization, and reliance on predefined metapaths.

Method: AMR employs automatic discovery of metapaths through bi-directional walks, an aspect-aware encoder using bi-LSTM, and integrates semantic path representations in subgraphs for recommendations.

Result: AMR demonstrated superior performance compared to existing graph neural network baselines across datasets such as MOOCCube and PEEK, validating its effectiveness in recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: AMR reduces reliance on predefined metapaths while improving path-specific aspect understanding, offering enhanced recommendation capabilities with promising experimental results.

Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' negotiation skills using the PieArena benchmark, showing that frontier models like GPT-5 can match or outperform business school students in strategic negotiations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs have advanced capabilities in negotiation, a critical skill for business involving strategic thinking and psychological insights.

Method: The researchers created PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark based on real-world interactions from a business school MBA course, to evaluate LLM negotiation performance.

Result: GPT-5 demonstrated AGI-level negotiation performance, outperforming trained business students in certain aspects. Mid- and lower-tier LMs showed improvement under specific conditions but were outperformed by frontier models.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs like GPT-5 show potential for deployment in complex economic negotiations but face challenges with robustness and trustworthiness that need to be addressed.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

TL;DR: ProAct is a framework for improving LLM agents in interactive environments. It enables long-horizon planning via a two-stage training involving GLAD for reasoning chains and MC-Critic to refine accuracy. It shows superior planning in stochastic and deterministic environments. Open-source code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with long-horizon planning due to compounded errors in future state simulations.

Method: ProAct employs two steps: Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD) for supervised fine-tuning using causal reasoning chains from search trees, and Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic) for enhancing policy algorithms with environment rollouts.

Result: ProAct improves planning accuracy significantly, outperforming open-source baselines, rivaling closed-source models, and generalizing well to new environments.

Conclusion: ProAct demonstrates robust enhancements in planning and decision accuracy for LLM agents through its innovative components GLAD and MC-Critic, marking a notable advancement in interactive AI systems.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called AgentXRay to create understandable workflows for black-box systems, improving interpretability using a search framework and proxy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability and control in agentic systems, which are often opaque to users despite their problem-solving abilities.

Method: The proposed method, AgentXRay, formulates workflow reconstruction as a combinatorial optimization task using Monte Carlo Tree Search with Red-Black Pruning to explore agent roles and tools in workflows.

Result: Experiments reveal that AgentXRay achieves better output similarity, lower token usage, and can explore deeper workflows within a limited computational budget.

Conclusion: AgentXRay introduces a novel way to reconstruct and edit workflows of black-box systems, enhancing their interpretability and usability through structured, metric-based searches.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

Motivation: To explore whether optimization of AI-based agents in real-world formal verification (theorem proving in Rocq) can be automated effectively, reducing reliance on manual intervention.

Method: The study compares various automatic agent optimization approaches, focusing on optimizing a proof-generation agent in Rocq, while examining factors like prompt design, contextual knowledge, and control strategies.

Result: Some optimizers showed measurable benefits, but simple few-shot bootstrapping consistently performed best, while none matched the performance of highly engineered expert systems.

Conclusion: Though automation shows promise, manual and expert tuning still outperforms automated methods for optimization in this domain.

Abstract: This work studies the applicability of automatic AI agent optimization methods to real-world agents in formal verification settings, focusing on automated theorem proving in Rocq as a representative and challenging domain. We evaluate how different automatic agent optimizers perform when applied to the task of optimizing a Rocq proof-generation agent, and assess whether parts of the fine-grained tuning of agentic systems, such as prompt design, contextual knowledge, and control strategies, can be automated. Our results show that while several optimizers yield measurable improvements, simple few-shot bootstrapping is the most consistently effective; however, none of the studied methods matches the performance of a carefully engineered state-of-the-art proof agent.

Result: Web-based agents struggle to find hidden evidence, integrate it effectively, and sometimes hallucinate reasoning. Explicit instructions improve context discovery but often harm overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Current architectures are insufficient for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and decision-making, indicating the need for improved mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

### [30] [RaBiT: Residual-Aware Binarization Training for Accurate and Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05367)
*Youngcheon You,Banseok Lee,Minseop Choi,Seonyoung Kim,Hyochan Chong,Changdong Kim,Youngmin Kim,Dongkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaBiT offers a solution for quantizing large language models (LLMs) efficiently, overcoming co-adaptation challenges through residual hierarchy mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significant inference speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance in extreme quantization for deploying large language models (LLMs) and tackle the limitation of previous approaches plagued by feature co-adaptation in residual binarization.

Method: RaBiT introduces a quantization framework that reduces inter-path feature co-adaptation by enforcing a residual hierarchy during quantization-aware training, utilizing sequential binary path error correction derived from shared full-precision weights and robust initialization techniques.

Result: RaBiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in 2-bit quantization, outperforms hardware-intensive methods like Vector Quantization (VQ), and provides a 4.49× inference speed-up on an RTX 4090 compared to full-precision models.

Conclusion: RaBiT sets a new benchmark for balancing efficiency and performance in LLM deployment, offering a quantization solution that optimizes speed without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

TL;DR: This study assesses the performance of four small medical large language models (LLMs) on ophthalmology patient queries and evaluates LLM-based grading against clinician assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safety and accuracy of domain-specific LLMs used in ophthalmology for patient education, triage, and decision-making through rigorous evaluation.

Method: 180 ophthalmology-related queries were answered by four LLMs, their responses evaluated by ophthalmologists and GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E framework. Agreement between clinician and LLM grading was analyzed using Spearman rank correlation and other statistical tools.

Result: Meerkat-7B performed best, while MedLLaMA3-v20 had the highest incidence of hallucinations and misleading content. GPT-4-Turbo's grading showed strong alignment with clinicians, though disparities existed between senior and junior opinions.

Conclusion: While medical LLMs show potential in ophthalmology, gaps in clinical depth and consensus remain. Hybrid frameworks of automated and clinician review are recommended for safe deployment.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

*Chenghua Gong,Yihang Jiang,Hao Li,Rui Sun,Juyuan Zhang,Tianjun Gu,Liming Pan,Linyuan Lü*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPINN, a Physics-Informed Neural Network framework for modeling opinion dynamics, achieving improved forecasting performance by integrating physical priors based on interacting particle theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing opinion dynamics models which lack comprehensive physical systems and struggle with optimization due to weak penalty-based physical constraints.

Method: The authors propose the OPINN framework, which employs Neural ODEs and integrates physical priors derived from a Diffusion-Convection-Reaction system inspired by interacting particle theory for opinion dynamics modeling.

Result: OPINN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in predicting opinion evolution on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OPINN provides a robust paradigm that effectively bridges physical, cyber, and social systems, enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of opinion dynamics predictions.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: H-AdminSim is proposed as a simulation framework for testing hospital administrative tasks with LLM-driven automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive solutions exploring the complexity of hospital administrative workflows, despite increasing demands for LLM-based automation.

Method: The researchers developed H-AdminSim, combining realistic data generation, multi-agent simulation, quantitative evaluation rubrics, and FHIR integration.

Result: H-AdminSim serves as a standardized environment for testing administrative workflows and comparing LLMs systematically in hospitals.

Conclusion: H-AdminSim bridges the gap in studying hospital administrative automation, offering interoperable testing solutions for diverse hospital systems.

Abstract: Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation. However, prior work has focused primarily on patient--physician interactions or isolated administrative subtasks, failing to capture the complexity of real administrative workflows. To address this gap, we propose H-AdminSim, a comprehensive end-to-end simulation framework that combines realistic data generation with multi-agent-based simulation of hospital administrative workflows. These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.

*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces THOR, an inductive link prediction model for hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs), achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing link prediction models for hyper-relational knowledge graphs are limited by their transductive setting, restricting generalization to unseen vocabularies.

Method: THOR utilizes three components: relation and entity foundation graphs for fundamental interactions and introduces graph encoders paired with a transformer decoder for fully-inductive reasoning.

Result: THOR shows significant performance improvement—66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4%—over top-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive methods on 12 datasets.

Conclusion: THOR effectively captures structural invariance for generalizable and efficient link prediction in hyper-relational knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome existing limitations in GUI agent data mining, such as high cost, low quality, and lack of data diversity, to advance intelligent human-computer interaction.

Method: The proposed method involves a collaborative multi-agent framework (InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent), an intent recycling strategy, and a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy.

Result: Experiments showed that GUI agents fine-tuned with M$^2$-Miner data achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mobile GUI benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study presents M$^2$-Miner as a significant contribution to improving GUI agent development by offering an efficient, high-quality, and diverse data-mining approach, and plans to release the work for community use.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

TL;DR: This paper presents and evaluates a spike regularization strategy and investigates the performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for electricity price forecasting (EPF), showing superior accuracy over traditional and DL models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in electricity price forecasting, particularly the volatility and nonlinearity of price signals, which are not effectively handled by traditional statistical and deep learning models.

Method: The study evaluates TSFMs like Tiny Time Mixers, MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, comparing them with statistical models (e.g., ARIMA) and DL models (e.g., LSTM, CNN-LSTM) on half-hourly volatile electricity price data in Singapore. It also incorporates exogenous factors like weather and calendar variables.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperform traditional models, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. This highlights their strong capability for forecasting in volatile markets.

Conclusion: The use of TSFMs offers significant promise for enhancing forecast accuracy in electricity price markets, providing practical guidance for stakeholders to navigate volatile energy markets more effectively.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes OD-CRL, a framework using orthogonal semantic bases and null-space projection for improved conditional representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sensitivity to subspace basis and inter-subspace interference issues faced by existing conditional representation learning methods.

Method: The authors introduce OD-CRL, which uses Adaptative Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) to create orthogonal semantic bases and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP) to eliminate irrelevant semantic interference.

Result: Experiments on clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks show that OD-CRL sets a new state-of-the-art with superior generalization performance.

Conclusion: OD-CRL overcomes key challenges in conditional representation learning and enables better task-specific feature extraction and generalization.

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

*Yiwen Duan,Jing Ye,Xinpei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALIVE, a hands-free alignment framework to enhance reasoning in LLMs by eliminating reliance on scalar rewards and focusing on intrinsic reasoning acquisition through adversarial learning and verbal feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning depends on scalar rewards which are costly, brittle across domains, and fail to represent reasoning logic, limiting the growth of reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Method: ALIVE integrates problem posing, solving, and judging in a single model and employs adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback to internalize reasoning criteria directly from raw data.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that ALIVE leads to improved accuracy, better generalization across domains, and enhanced self-correction rates compared to traditional methods, using the same data and computational resources.

Conclusion: ALIVE fosters sustainable reasoning capability growth, offering a scalable, general-purpose framework for aligning reasoning in LLMs without requiring human-in-the-loop supervision.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

*Zhe Wang,Zijing Liu,Chencheng Xu,Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Phi-former, a deep learning method for drug discovery that enhances prediction of compound-protein interactions (CPIs) by incorporating molecular motifs' biological roles, achieving superior performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for CPI prediction are inefficient and recent deep learning models do not fully align with chemical realities, as they overlook the role of molecular motifs in biological recognition.

Method: Phi-former is a hierarchical interaction representation method using pairwise pre-training. It models interactions at atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels while incorporating intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines.

Result: Phi-former shows superior performance on CPI-related tasks compared to existing methods. It accurately identifies specific molecular motifs activated during CPIs.

Conclusion: Phi-former provides an interpretable deep learning framework that can aid rational drug design and precision medicine by aligning with biological recognition mechanisms.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDFP, a framework for speeding up large language model decoding by pruning low-impact layers, offering a 1.32x–1.5x speed improvement without additional training or altering outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are critical for multimedia tasks but face latency issues due to autoregressive decoding. Creating draft models to reduce latency has been expensive and complex, motivating a need for simpler, training-free solutions.

Method: The authors introduce SDFP, which prunes low-impact layers of an LLM based on Fisher Information Trace (FIT) to construct a compact draft model without requiring additional training or tuning.

Result: SDFP achieves a 1.32x to 1.5x speedup in decoding across benchmarks while maintaining the same output distribution of the original model.

Conclusion: SDFP provides a training-free, efficient, and deployment-friendly approach to speed up LLM decoding, enabling practical use in latency-sensitive multimedia applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources lack sufficient ameloblastoma coverage and format consistency for AI model development.

Method: The authors curated a multimodal dataset, used NLP for extracting clinical features from text, and employed preprocessing and augmentation for radiological and histopathological images.

Result: The model achieved increased classification accuracy (46.2% to 65.9%) and improved F1-score for tissue detection (43.0% to 90.3%).

Conclusion: The study enhances personalized decision support in maxillofacial pathology by providing a high-quality dataset and adaptable AI diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

*Florian Dietz,William Wale,Oscar Gilg,Robert McCarthy,Felix Michalak,Gustavo Ewbank Rodrigues Danon,Miguelito de Guzman,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Split Personality Training (SPT), a novel technique that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) to uncover misalignment and concealed behaviors effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods to detect misalignment in LLMs struggle due to the models hiding misbehaviors during training or limitations in auditing techniques like black-box methods and mechanistic interpretability.

Method: SPT introduces an 'honest persona' through LoRA fine-tuning, which remains inactive initially but is activated post-response with a trigger string. It enables latent state access for detecting concealed behaviors.

Result: SPT achieves 96% accuracy in detecting model exploits and misalignments, outperforming benchmark methods which report near 0% accuracy.

Conclusion: Split Personality Training effectively addresses misalignment detection challenges by enabling latent state access in language models, showcasing its superiority over traditional auditing techniques.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

*Zhengyi Guo,Wenpin Tang,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for conditional generation in diffusion models by enforcing hard constraints, ensuring generated samples meet specified events with 100% probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety-critical applications and rare-event simulation, where ensuring that generated samples satisfy strict requirements is essential and cannot be achieved through existing soft-guidance methods.

Method: The authors leverage a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models and propose a conditional diffusion guidance framework using Doob's h-transform, martingale representation, and quadratic variation. They develop off-policy learning algorithms based on martingale identities to estimate the required components while maintaining a pretrained model.

Result: The framework ensures hard constraint satisfaction with theoretical guarantees in total variation and Wasserstein distances. Numerical experiments verify the model's efficiency in generating samples under strict constraints and with rare-event scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in incorporating hard constraints for conditional generation in diffusion models and offers rigorous guarantees for performance, making it viable for safety-critical tasks and rare-event generation.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors.

*Fahad Anwaar,Adil Mehmood Khan,Muhammad Khalid,Usman Zia,Kezhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework combining collaborative filtering (CF) with language models for explainable sequential recommendations, achieving significant performance improvements and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based systems for recommendation overlook collaborative signals, and separating recommendation and explanation tasks increases resource use. The paper seeks to integrate these tasks efficiently while incorporating CF knowledge.

Method: RGCF-XRec uses reasoning-guided CF, a structured scoring mechanism across four dimensions, and a unified representation network to condition LLMs for recommendations and explanations simultaneously.

Result: The method shows consistent performance gains across benchmark datasets—improving HR@10, ROUGE-L, cold-start, warm-start, and zero-shot metrics—demonstrating robustness, generalization, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: RGCF-XRec effectively integrates CF into LLMs to provide explainable recommendations, achieving better performance and scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

*Yikun Zong,Cheston Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a test-time self-refinement framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in solving Tangram puzzles by mimicking human iterative cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fundamental challenge of improving continuous geometric reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which currently fail to match human performance in solving Tangram puzzles.

Method: The proposed framework introduces a training-free test-time self-refinement mechanism using in-context learning (ICL) and reward-guided feedback loops to iteratively refine predictions without retraining.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements in geometric reasoning accuracy, with IoU scores improving from 0.63 to 0.932 in medium-triangle Tangram cases.

Conclusion: Incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops brings us closer to realizing self-improving AI for continuous spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

### [46] [Emulating Aggregate Human Choice Behavior and Biases with GPT Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05597)
*Stephen Pilli,Vivek Nallur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can replicate human cognitive biases and decision-making dynamics accurately under varying conditions like cognitive load. Using conversational scenarios, results showed that LLMs such as GPT-4 and GPT-5 reproduce human biases and exhibit model-specific behavior differences. It emphasizes potential for bias-aware AI design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs can predict human cognitive biases at an individual level and simulate the interplay of biases with contextual factors such as cognitive load in decision-making scenarios.

Method: Adapted three decision-making scenarios into conversational formats. Conducted a human experiment (N=1100) using chatbot-facilitated dialogues varying in complexity. Simulated conditions through LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5) using participant demographics and dialogue transcripts.

Result: LLMs effectively reproduced human cognitive biases, with significant differences in how GPT-4 and GPT-5 aligned with human behavior dynamics. This demonstrated their potential in simulating biased decision-making.

Conclusion: The study shows that LLMs can emulate human biases under interactive conditions, highlighting the need to design adaptive and bias-aware AI systems for interactive applications.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

*Subhadip Maji,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving NLP systems for low-resource languages using cross-lingual knowledge transfer, introducing a method called GETR that shows significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in NLP for low-resource languages caused by data scarcity, by leveraging cross-lingual knowledge transfer from high-resource languages.

Method: The authors propose GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer, alongside two baselines: augmentation in hidden layers and token embedding transfer through token translation.

Result: GETR achieves significant improvements in performance for low-resource languages, with 13 percentage point gains for POS tagging and up to 27 percentage points for sentiment classification and NER tasks, compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: GETR demonstrates substantial effectiveness and provides insights into key factors driving successful cross-lingual transfer for low-resource language NLP tasks.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

*Simon Kohaut,Benedict Flade,Julian Eggert,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Resin, a probabilistic programming language, and Reactive Circuits (RCs) to enable efficient real-time belief updates in dynamic environments by exploiting heterogeneous update rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents require efficient real-time belief updates, but existing methods fail to handle frequent changes and heterogeneous update rates effectively.

Method: The authors introduce Resin, a probabilistic programming language merging logic and reactive programming, and propose Reactive Circuits, adaptive structures that optimize inference tasks using memoization and input volatility.

Result: High-fidelity drone simulations showed several orders of magnitude speedup compared to traditional frequency-agnostic inference methods.

Conclusion: Reactive Circuits adapt to dynamic environments by partitioning computations based on input update frequency, enabling efficient and reactive real-time probabilistic reasoning.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

*Christopher A. McClurg,Alan R. Wagner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven simulation model to evaluate school security measures for emergency scenarios like school shootings, enabling scalable testing of interventions using virtual reality (VR) data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the difficulty in assessing security intervention strategies for school shootings due to the challenge of recruiting new participant cohorts for VR studies, which limits large-scale or iterative evaluations.

Method: The authors developed a discrete-event simulator (DES) informed by stochastic processes that mimic participant behaviors observed in VR studies and used it to assess robot-based intervention strategies in shooter scenarios.

Result: The DES successfully reproduced key empirical patterns from VR studies, demonstrating its ability to enable scalable evaluation and learning of autonomous school-security interventions.

Conclusion: This study presents a scalable, high-to-mid fidelity simulation framework for developing and evaluating intervention strategies in school security, providing a practical alternative to direct human subject testing.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

### [50] [Generative Ontology: When Structured Knowledge Learns to Create](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05636)
*Benny Cheung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Ontology, a framework that combines traditional ontology with large language models to generate structurally valid and creative outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ontologies lack creativity, while large language models can be creative but often generate outputs lacking structured validity. This gap highlights the need for a system that integrates these strengths.

Method: Generative Ontology uses Pydantic schemas to incorporate domain knowledge and constrain LLM outputs through DSPy signatures. It employs a multi-agent pipeline with distinct roles, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation and iterative validation.

Result: The framework was demonstrated via 'GameGrammar,' which successfully generated structurally complete and creative tabletop game designs based on thematic prompts.

Conclusion: Generative Ontology enables structured and creative generation by aligning constraints with creativity, extending applicability to domains with defined vocabularies and constraints.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

TL;DR: This survey reviews the use of graph-based memory in LLM-based agents for complex tasks, covering taxonomy, techniques, tools, applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM-based agents' ability to handle long-horizon tasks through efficient memory structures, emphasizing graph-based approaches.

Method: The paper provides a taxonomy of agent memory, analyzes techniques for graph-based memory life cycle (extraction, storage, retrieval, evolution), and reviews tools, benchmarks, and application scenarios.

Result: Graph-based memory systems are systematically reviewed, with actionable insights for development provided alongside open resources.

Conclusion: Graph-based memory is a promising mechanism for advancing efficient and reliable self-evolving agent memory systems, with challenges and future directions outlined.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

*Yihao Ouyang,Shiwei Li,Haozhao Wang,Xiandi Luo,Zhuoqi Hu,Yuetong Song,Qiyu Qin,Yichen Li,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GenLoRA, a more efficient variant of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) that utilizes nonlinear basis vector generation to reduce parameter redundancy and improve fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA exhibits parameter redundancy in its explicit-rank paradigm, which demands substantial parameter growth for increased capacity. The paper aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: GenLoRA utilizes lightweight nonlinear radial basis functions (RBFs) for generating basis vectors. Instead of storing explicit basis vectors, it maintains latent vectors and synthesizes basis vectors using RBFs for improved parameter efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenLoRA achieves higher effective ranks and superior fine-tuning performance under smaller parameter budgets across various datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: GenLoRA enhances the efficiency and performance of Low-rank adaptation by replacing explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear generation, offering a scalable and effective solution for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

*Tianyi Wang,Long Li,Hongcan Guo,Yibiao Chen,Yixia Li,Yong Wang,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies challenges in reinforcement learning rewards systems and proposes Anchored Policy Optimization (APO) to prevent systemic collapses while improving efficiency and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), a systemic issue in reinforcement learning where valid alternative sampling probabilities diminish irreversibly.

Method: The paper introduces Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), which moves from conventional Shape Matching to Support Coverage using a Safe Manifold based on high-confidence support, allowing targeted sharpening and error correction capabilities.

Result: APO achieves improved accuracy (Pass@1) and restores diversity (Pass@K) in policy optimization, avoiding the trade-offs common in traditional methods.

Conclusion: APO offers a paradigm shift in reinforcement learning optimization by balancing correctness and diversity, effectively addressing RSC and showing superior empirical performance compared to standard methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

*Taoye Yin,Haoyuan Hu,Yaxin Fan,Xinhao Chen,Xinya Wu,Kai Deng,Kezun Zhang,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning framework with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV) to improve response consistency in financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations and inconsistencies in model-generated responses within financial RAG systems, where accurate, time-sensitive information is crucial.

Method: The authors propose RLFKV, which assesses the correctness of atomic knowledge units in responses using a fine-grained faithful reward and incorporates an informativeness reward to encourage detailed and accurate responses.

Result: The framework showed consistent improvements over benchmarks in experiments conducted on the Financial Data Description (FDD) task and the newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset.

Conclusion: RLFKV effectively improves response consistency and alignment with retrieved financial documents, offering a step forward in reducing hallucinations in RAG systems.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Amit Kravchik Taub,Fred M. Grabovski,Guy Amit,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces LeakBoost, an advanced membership inference attack (MIA) framework to evaluate privacy risks by leveraging dynamic model behavior in white-box settings. It significantly enhances current methods' performance using an interrogation image approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitations of existing MIAs, which primarily depend on static metrics like loss or confidence and fail to fully utilize dynamic model behaviors to improve privacy threat detection.

Method: LeakBoost uses a perceptual-loss-based interrogation approach to amplify membership signals in a model's internal representations by optimizing an activation-space objective. The interrogation image created is analyzed via existing membership detectors without modification.

Result: LeakBoost provides notable accuracy improvements in detecting membership signals, increasing AUC to 0.81-0.88 and TPR at 1% FPR by over an order of magnitude. The method identifies that deeper layers and low-learning-rate optimization maximize effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a modular and efficient way to analyze privacy risks using dynamic membership inference, offering significant advancements over current static methods, particularly for gradient-based detectors.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an asynchronous policy training framework for Vision-Language-Action models to address efficiency limitations in reinforcement learning pipelines and demonstrates significant improvements in throughput and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome training efficiency limitations in Vision-Language-Action models caused by the synchronous execution of existing reinforcement learning training frameworks.

Method: The paper introduces a fully asynchronous policy training framework with a multi-level decoupled architecture, featuring asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates.

Result: The framework achieves up to 59.25% throughput improvement on the LIBERO benchmark compared to synchronous methods and up to 126.67% improvement with optimized separation strategies. It also demonstrates strong scalability across 8 to 256 GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed asynchronous framework enhances training efficiency, scalability, and resource utilization for Vision-Language-Action models, making it a superior alternative to synchronous strategies.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for a specialized financial language model tailored for the Indian digital payment ecosystem.

Method: Adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture using a multi-stage training pipeline involving curated financial, multilingual, and synthetic data followed by specific fine-tuning.

Result: FiMI Base improves finance reasoning benchmarks by 20%, and FiMI Instruct outperforms tool-calling tasks by 87%, while maintaining general performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: FiMI demonstrates that domain-specific optimization can significantly boost performance in specialized financial workflows without sacrificing general model capabilities.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data. This is followed by instruction fine-tuning and domain-specific supervised fine-tuning focused on multi-turn, tool-driven conversations that model real-world workflows, such as transaction disputes and mandate lifecycle management.

### [58] [NEX: Neuron Explore-Exploit Scoring for Label-Free Chain-of-Thought Selection and Model Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05805)
*Kang Chen,Zhuoka Feng,Sihan Zhao,Kai Xiong,Junjie Nian,Yaoning Wang,Changyi Xiao,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEX, an unsupervised scoring framework to address challenges in reasoning and selection phases of large language models, balancing exploration and exploitation effectively and predicting better downstream accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the inefficiencies and overthinking that arise during the exploration and selection processes of large language models, especially in unsupervised reasoning scenarios.

Method: The authors developed NEX, a scoring framework utilizing neuron activation patterns, inferred through spikes in activation and modeled via a two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to distinguish exploration (E-phase) from exploitation (X-phase).

Result: NEX successfully ranks candidate responses and predicts downstream accuracy without task-specific answers, validated through benchmarks, human annotations, and neuron transfer experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed NEX framework provides an efficient, label-free approach to assess and improve reasoning within large models, addressing redundancy and enhancing reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial proteomics data is scarce compared to spatial transcriptomics due to technical challenges and cost, creating a need for computational methods to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposed STProtein, which uses a graph neural network with a multi-task learning strategy to predict spatial protein expression from available spatial multi-omics data.

Result: STProtein can predict spatial protein expression, enabling the discovery of complex spatial protein patterns and uncovering unknown biological relationships.

Conclusion: STProtein provides a computational solution for integrating spatial proteomics, accelerating discoveries in biology and addressing spatial multi-omics challenges.

Abstract: The integration of spatial multi-omics data from single tissues is crucial for advancing biological research. However, a significant data imbalance impedes progress: while spatial transcriptomics data is relatively abundant, spatial proteomics data remains scarce due to technical limitations and high costs. To overcome this challenge we propose STProtein, a novel framework leveraging graph neural networks with multi-task learning strategy. STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological "Dark Matter".

*Zihao Jiang,Miao Peng,Zhenyan Shan,Wenjie Xu,Ben Liu,Gong Chen,Ziqi Gao,Min Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TKG-Thinker enhances temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) by integrating autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval for better temporal reasoning in TKGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome shortcomings of Large Language Models (LLMs) in TKGQA, such as reasoning errors under complex temporal constraints and the rigidity of static prompts, which limit model autonomy and generalization.

Method: The authors propose TKG-Thinker, an agent using dual-training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought data develops planning skills, while Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimizes reasoning policies with multi-dimensional rewards.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets with various LLMs show that TKG-Thinker sets new performance standards and demonstrates strong adaptability to complex TKGQA environments.

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker effectively addresses limitations in current approaches to TKGQA, achieving state-of-the-art results and advancing autonomous reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces strategies to create more efficient and accurate Boolean neural networks for resource-constrained environments, achieving up to 37x computational improvement over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point neural networks are computationally expensive, and resource-constrained environments require efficient alternatives like Boolean networks, though these are hard to optimize.

Method: The authors propose (1) efficient connection learning with minimal overhead, (2) a compact convolutional Boolean architecture for reduced operations, and (3) adaptive discretization to mitigate accuracy losses when converting models.

Result: Their proposed strategies outperform state-of-the-art methods by achieving better accuracy with significantly fewer Boolean operations, as shown in benchmarks.

Conclusion: These methods advance the practicality of Boolean neural networks by improving their computational efficiency and accuracy in resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Floating-point neural networks dominate modern machine learning but incur substantial inference cost, motivating interest in Boolean networks for resource-constrained settings. However, learning compact and accurate Boolean networks is challenging due to their combinatorial nature. In this work, we address this challenge from three different angles: learned connections, compact convolutions and adaptive discretization. First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one. Extensive results on standard vision benchmarks demonstrate that the Pareto front of accuracy vs. computation of our method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art, achieving better accuracy with up to 37x fewer Boolean operations.

Abstract: While humans perceive the world through diverse modalities that operate synergistically to support a holistic understanding of their surroundings, existing omnivideo models still face substantial challenges on audio-visual understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning. OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.

Result: BABE effectively reflects the challenges of scientific reasoning, providing a framework for evaluating AI's ability to think like practicing scientists.

Conclusion: BABE offers a more authentic way to assess AI systems' capacity for biological research, highlighting advancements in experimental reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities from basic dialogue to advanced scientific reasoning.

To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry.

*Anton Ipsen,Michael Cashmore,Kirsty Fielding,Nicolas Marchesotti,Parisa Zehtabi,Daniele Magazzeni,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to solve the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) to optimize seating arrangements for large organizational teams, ensuring hierarchically close teams are seated nearby.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large organizations often struggle to manually replan optimal seating arrangements for hierarchical teams, leading to inefficiency. This study aims to automate and optimize this process.

Method: The authors propose an end-to-end framework combining probabilistic road maps (PRM), rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT), heuristic search, and dynamic programming within an integer programming approach.

Result: They validate the framework through experiments of varying instance sizes and assess performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable and effective solution for hierarchical seating allocation, replacing the inefficient manual processes in large organizations.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Lukas Stappen,Ahmet Erkan Turan,Johann Hagerer,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses security challenges of LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles and introduces AgentHeLLM, a framework for threat modeling with a clear separation of concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of existing AI security frameworks that fail to rigorously separate asset protection from attack paths, especially for LLM-based assistants in vehicles that interact with sensitive systems.

Method: A new framework, AgentHeLLM, is proposed which separates asset identification from attack path analysis. It introduces a human-centric asset taxonomy inspired by human rights and employs a formal graph-based model to differentiate between malicious data and actions.

Result: The framework includes a practical tool called AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

Conclusion: AgentHeLLM provides a systematic way to identify and address security threats in LLM-based automotive systems, enhancing safety and trust in such applications.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

TL;DR: This paper provides practical guidance on effectively using large language models (LLMs) for Modeling & Simulation (M&S), highlighting common pitfalls and offering diagnostic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address confusion and challenges researchers face when utilizing LLMs for M&S applications, ensuring effective and informed usage.

Method: The paper discusses issues such as non-determinism, knowledge augmentation techniques, hyper-parameter settings, and decomposition of M&S data. It emphasizes principled design choices and empirical evaluation.

Result: Practical guidance, diagnostics, and strategies are provided to help researchers and practitioners make more effective decisions when leveraging LLMs for M&S workflows.

Conclusion: Effective use of LLMs in M&S requires a comprehensive understanding of their complexities and limitations. Researchers are advised to adopt principled approaches, evaluate models empirically, and account for subtle issues to achieve optimal outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores classical and quantum reinforcement learning approaches to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and finds that hybrid quantum-classical models outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of quantum and hybrid reinforcement learning models in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems like CVRP compared to classical methods.

Method: Implemented an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in three variants (classical, full quantum, and hybrid) with transformer architectures focusing on attention mechanisms. Conducted experiments in a multi-vehicle scenario with specific metrics and independent runs.

Result: Quantum-enhanced models outperformed classical ones, with the hybrid quantum-classical architecture achieving the best performance across all evaluated metrics.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models demonstrate superior performance and potential for solving complex problems like CVRP by producing more structured and coherent solutions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

*Krešimir Kušić,Vinny Cahill,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces a traffic forecasting model leveraging geographical relationships to improve accuracy in digital twin applications for motorway traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance motorway traffic prediction for digital-twin technology, addressing the challenges posed by traffic's non-linear and spatio-temporal complexities.

Method: It proposes the Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting (GATTF) model, utilizing mutual information to incorporate sensor-based geographical relationships.

Result: The GATTF model, tested on Geneva motorway data, showed better forecasting accuracy than standard Transformer models without added complexity.

Conclusion: Incorporating geographical awareness into deep-learning models effectively improves traffic prediction accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Motivation: SER has been limited by insufficient datasets. The study aims to explore Whisper's potential in addressing this gap by using effective dimensionality reduction techniques that preserve emotional features.

Method: Two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, are proposed and evaluated using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets in both English and Persian contexts.

Result: The multi-head QKV pooling method achieved state-of-the-art unweighted accuracy, especially a 2.47% improvement on the ShEMO dataset. Intermediate Whisper encoder layers performed better than larger models like HuBERT X-Large for Persian SER.

Conclusion: Whisper is validated as a strong feature extractor for SER. Attention-based pooling effectively preserves emotional features while reducing dimensions, enhancing SER performance.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

Motivation: Current benchmarks don't effectively evaluate language-mediated economic interactions among autonomous multi-agent systems.

Method: AgenticPay provides a simulation for market negotiations using natural language, covering over 110 tasks with structured metrics for evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant gaps in negotiation performance, mainly in long-horizon strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: AgenticPay establishes itself as a vital tool for studying agentic commerce and enhancing language-based market interactions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DyTopo introduces a manager-guided multi-agent framework for enhancing multi-round reasoning via dynamically evolving communication graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems lack the ability to adjust their communication patterns based on stage-dependent needs during iterative problem-solving.

Method: The system uses a manager to guide agents by reconstructing sparse, directed communication graphs in each iteration. Agents generate natural-language descriptors for queries and offers, which are semantically matched to route private communication dynamically.

Result: Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, DyTopo consistently outperformed the strongest baseline with an average improvement of +6.2. It also demonstrated highly interpretable evolving communication pathways.

Conclusion: DyTopo improves reasoning accuracy and enables interpretable coordination among agents by leveraging dynamically reconfigurable communication patterns.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sustainable computing by understanding the full environmental impact of emerging hardware systems like eNVMs over their life cycle.

Method: The study presents COFFEE, a carbon modeling framework, using data from semiconductor fabs and fabrication recipes, alongside architecture-level tools to assess life cycle carbon footprint.

Result: COFFEE reveals HZO-FeFETs have a lower embodied carbon per MB compared to SRAM but slightly higher embodied carbon overhead per unit area. Additionally, their use in edge ML accelerators reduces embodied carbon by 42.3% and operational carbon by up to 70%.

Conclusion: The research highlights the sustainability advantage of HZO-based FeFET eNVMs over conventional memory, emphasizing their potential in reducing environmental impact.

Abstract: Information and communication technologies account for a growing portion of global environmental impacts. While emerging technologies, such as emerging non-volatile memories (eNVM), offer a promising solution to energy efficient computing, their end-to-end footprint is not well understood. Understanding the environmental impact of hardware systems over their life cycle is the first step to realizing sustainable computing. This work conducts a detailed study of one example eNVM device: hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO)-based ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs). We present COFFEE, the first carbon modeling framework for HZO-based FeFET eNVMs across life cycle, from hardware manufacturing (embodied carbon) to use (operational carbon). COFFEE builds on data gathered from a real semiconductor fab and device fabrication recipes to estimate embodied carbon, and architecture level eNVM design space exploration tools to quantify use-phase performance and energy. Our evaluation shows that, at 2 MB capacity, the embodied carbon per unit area overhead of HZO-FeFETs can be up to 11% higher than the CMOS baseline, while the embodied carbon per MB remains consistently about 4.3x lower than SRAM across different memory capacity. A further case study applies COFFEE to an edge ML accelerator, showing that replacing the SRAM-based weight buffer with HZO-based FeFET eNVMs reduces embodied carbon by 42.3% and operational carbon by up to 70%.

Motivation: To address the challenges of supporting variable FP8 aligned-mantissa bitwidths in DCIM architectures, enabling better handling of diverse input data distributions, critical for Transformer workloads.

Method: Three innovations are proposed: (1) Dynamic Shift-Aware Bitwidth Prediction (DSBP), which adaptively adjusts precision; (2) FIFO-based Input Alignment Unit (FIAU) for simplified alignment; and (3) a Precision-Scalable INT MAC array for flexible weight precision.

Result: The accelerator, implemented in 28nm CMOS, achieves 20.4 TFLOPS/W for fixed E5M7 formats, with a 2.8x efficiency improvement over previous FP8 works. Testing with the Llama-7b model demonstrated superior efficiency without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed design supports all FP8 formats with higher efficiency and configurability, offering flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, making it highly suitable for various Transformer-based tasks.

Abstract: FP8 low-precision formats have gained significant adoption in Transformer inference and training. However, existing digital compute-in-memory (DCIM) architectures face challenges in supporting variable FP8 aligned-mantissa bitwidths, as unified alignment strategies and fixed-precision multiply-accumulate (MAC) units struggle to handle input data with diverse distributions. This work presents a flexible FP8 DCIM accelerator with three innovations: (1) a dynamic shift-aware bitwidth prediction (DSBP) with on-the-fly input prediction that adaptively adjusts weight (2/4/6/8b) and input (2$\sim$12b) aligned-mantissa precision; (2) a FIFO-based input alignment unit (FIAU) replacing complex barrel shifters with pointer-based control; and (3) a precision-scalable INT MAC array achieving flexible weight precision with minimal overhead. Implemented in 28nm CMOS with a 64$\times$96 CIM array, the design achieves 20.4 TFLOPS/W for fixed E5M7, demonstrating 2.8$\times$ higher FP8 efficiency than previous work while supporting all FP8 formats. Results on Llama-7b show that the DSBP achieves higher efficiency than fixed bitwidth mode at the same accuracy level on both BoolQ and Winogrande datasets, with configurable parameters enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

### [75] [BioACE: An Automated Framework for Biomedical Answer and Citation Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04982)
*Deepak Gupta,Davis Bartels,Dina Demner-Fuhsman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of responses and citations produced by large language models in biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of large language models in biomedical question-answering necessitates robust evaluation metrics to assess answer quality and the reliability of supporting references.

Method: BioACE evaluates answers and citations based on four key aspects: completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, using automated techniques like natural language inference and pre-trained language models.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal strong correlations between BioACE's automated evaluations and human assessments, demonstrating its efficacy in validating biomedical answers and citations.

Conclusion: BioACE offers a reliable framework for automated evaluation of biomedical text, providing tools to improve and standardize quality assessments in the field.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for generating answers to biomedical questions, it is crucial to evaluate the quality of the generated answers and the references provided to support the facts in the generated answers. Evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks in the biomedical domain, due to the requirements of expert assessment to verify consistency with the scientific literature and complex medical terminology. In this work, we propose BioACE, an automated framework for evaluating biomedical answers and citations against the facts stated in the answers. The proposed BioACE framework considers multiple aspects, including completeness, correctness, precision, and recall, in relation to the ground-truth nuggets for answer evaluation. We developed automated approaches to evaluate each of the aforementioned aspects and performed extensive experiments to assess and analyze their correlation with human evaluations. In addition, we considered multiple existing approaches, such as natural language inference (NLI) and pre-trained language models and LLMs, to evaluate the quality of evidence provided to support the generated answers in the form of citations into biomedical literature. With the detailed experiments and analysis, we provide the best approaches for biomedical answer and citation evaluation as a part of BioACE (https://github.com/deepaknlp/BioACE) evaluation package.

### [76] [Characterizing Human Semantic Navigation in Concept Production as Trajectories in Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05971)
*Felipe D. Toro-Hernández,Jesuino Vieira Filho,Rodrigo M. Cabral-Carvalho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to study how humans navigate semantic representations, using transformer-based embeddings and geometric metrics across various datasets and contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how humans traverse semantic representation can provide insights into cognitive function and its connection to learned models, and has applications in clinical and linguistic research.

Method: The framework uses transformer text embedding models to construct individual semantic trajectories and applies geometric and dynamical metrics to analyze navigation. It evaluates this approach on datasets in different languages and contexts.

Result: The framework successfully distinguishes clinical groups and concept types, showing robustness across embedding models and datasets. Cumulative embeddings are effective for longer semantic trajectories, while non-cumulative metrics are more suitable for shorter ones.

Conclusion: Semantic navigation can be modeled as structured trajectories in embedding space, enabling computational assessment of meaning dynamics. The framework has broad applications in cognitive and clinical research, as well as artificial cognition modeling.

Abstract: Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.

*Zexin Lin,Jiachen Yu,Haoyang Zhang,Yuzhao Li,Zhonghang Li,Yujiu Yang,Junjie Wang,Xiaoqiang Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoWork-X enables real-time and adaptive multi-episode collaboration in interactive environments by combining structured skill execution with post-episode optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highly cooperative tasks require real-time coordination and sustained adaptation under strict token budgets, which current approaches struggle to address effectively.

Method: CoWork-X combines HTN-based skill retrieval during episodes with patch-style skill consolidation post-episode, optimizing both execution and adaptation.

Result: The framework achieves stable performance gains in collaboration tasks while reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: CoWork-X successfully enhances task collaboration by integrating structured execution and efficient adaptation within budget constraints.

Abstract: Large language models are enabling language-conditioned agents in interactive environments, but highly cooperative tasks often impose two simultaneous constraints: sub-second real-time coordination and sustained multi-episode adaptation under a strict online token budget. Existing approaches either rely on frequent in-episode reasoning that induces latency and timing jitter, or deliver post-episode improvements through unstructured text that is difficult to compile into reliable low-cost execution. We propose CoWork-X, an active co-evolution framework that casts peer collaboration as a closed-loop optimization problem across episodes, inspired by fast--slow memory separation. CoWork-X instantiates a Skill-Agent that executes via HTN (hierarchical task network)-based skill retrieval from a structured, interpretable, and compositional skill library, and a post-episode Co-Optimizer that performs patch-style skill consolidation with explicit budget constraints and drift regularization. Experiments in challenging Overcooked-AI-like realtime collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CoWork-X achieves stable, cumulative performance gains while steadily reducing online latency and token usage.

### [78] [Capacity Constraints and the Multilingual Penalty for Lexical Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05035)
*Sean Trott,Pamela D. Rivière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual language models underperform in lexical disambiguation compared to monolingual models, due to capacity limitations. The study identifies representational, attentional, and vocabulary-related constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multilingual language models fail to match monolingual models in tasks requiring precise semantic understanding, such as lexical disambiguation.

Method: The researchers use controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments in English and Spanish to compare monolingual and multilingual models and analyze potential capacity limitations.

Result: Multilingual LMs were found to have reduced embedding isotropy, lower attention to distinctive language cues, and higher multi-token segmentation, affecting their performance.

Conclusion: Multilingual models face multiple capacity constraints that impact their ability to disambiguate lexical meaning effectively, explaining their performance gap relative to monolingual models.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (LMs) sometimes under-perform their monolingual counterparts, possibly due to capacity limitations. We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.

### [79] [Locas: Your Models are Principled Initializers of Locally-Supported Parametric Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05085)
*Sidi Lu,Zhenwen Liang,Dongyang Ma,Yan Wang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Locas, a parametric memory mechanism designed for transformers, enabling efficient continual learning and memory flexibility with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in test-time-training by introducing a flexible mechanism to offload and merge memory into model parameters, improving efficiency and continual learning.

Method: The paper introduces Locas, a locally-supported parametric memory that can be integrated into transformer models. Two variants are discussed: one with a two-layer MLP and another with GLU-FFN design for parameter and computation efficiency. Proper initialization is emphasized to enhance performance and reduce catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Locas was validated on language modeling and dialogue tasks, showing its ability to store past context with only 0.02% additional parameters and minimal context window. Comparative evaluation also demonstrated minimized knowledge loss when integrating new information.

Conclusion: Locas proves to be a promising approach for continual learning in transformers, enabling efficient integration of new knowledge while preserving existing model capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to bridge test-time-training with a new type of parametric memory that can be flexibly offloaded from or merged into model parameters. We present Locas, a Locally-Supported parametric memory that shares the design of FFN blocks in modern transformers, allowing it to be flexibly permanentized into the model parameters while supporting efficient continual learning. We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.

### [80] [Data Kernel Perspective Space Performance Guarantees for Synthetic Data from Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05106)
*Michael Browder,Kevin Duh,J. David Harris,Vince Lyzinski,Paul McNamee,Youngser Park,Carey E. Priebe,Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of data scarcity for language technology and generative AI, proposing a mathematical framework called DKPS to analyze and ensure quality performance of synthetic data outputs from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the widespread issue of insufficient labeled data for building effective language models, and the unpredictability of synthetic data quality generated by LLMs.

Method: The authors propose a mathematical analysis framework called Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to statistically guarantee synthetic data quality and link it to downstream performance improvements.

Result: DKPS is mathematically derived to offer performance guarantees, demonstrating its ability to improve tasks such as neural machine translation and models trained with Contrastive Preference Optimization.

Conclusion: The study establishes DKPS as a theoretical foundation for predictable and guaranteed synthetic data quality, addressing uncertainty issues in LLM applications, while acknowledging limitations and proposing directions for future research.

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.

### [81] [Multilingual Extraction and Recognition of Implicit Discourse Relations in Speech and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05107)
*Ahmed Ruby,Christian Hardmeier,Sara Stymne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses implicit discourse relation classification by using multilingual and multimodal datasets (English, French, Spanish) with textual and acoustic integration through Qwen2-Audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit discourse relation classification relies heavily on context, which may not always be captured by text alone, necessitating a multimodal and multilingual approach.

Method: A new dataset is constructed for distantly related and unrelated languages, and a multimodal classification approach using Qwen2-Audio integrates text and acoustic data.

Result: Text-based models outperformed audio-based models, but combining both modalities improved performance. Cross-lingual transfer notably enhanced results for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Multimodal and cross-lingual approaches are effective for improving implicit discourse relation classification, particularly in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenging task, as it requires inferring meaning from context. While contextual cues can be distributed across modalities and vary across languages, they are not always captured by text alone. To address this, we introduce an automatic method for distantly related and unrelated language pairs to construct a multilingual and multimodal dataset for implicit discourse relations in English, French, and Spanish. For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages. We find that while text-based models outperform audio-based models, integrating both modalities can enhance performance, and cross-lingual transfer can provide substantial improvements for low-resource languages.

*Yang Zhang,Mersin Konomi,Christos Xypolopoulos,Konstantinos Divriotis,Konstantinos Skianis,Giannis Nikolentzos,Giorgos Stamou,Guokan Shang,Michalis Vazirgiannis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GreekMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating Greek-focused language models, with 21,805 multiple-choice questions sourced authentically and covering 45 areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of Greek language benchmarks, which are often machine-translated from English and fail to reflect authentic Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics.

Method: The study developed GreekMMLU, a benchmark sourced directly from native Greek educational, professional, and governmental content, categorizing questions by difficulty and subjects, and releasing most samples publicly while reserving some for private leaderboard evaluation.

Result: Over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs were evaluated, revealing notable performance gaps between frontier and local models and underscoring weaknesses in general multilingual models adapted for Greek.

Conclusion: The GreekMMLU benchmark highlights areas to enhance LLM performance in Greek, stressing the importance of native source materials and systematic analysis for effective model adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multilingual corpora that include Greek, yet reliable evaluation benchmarks for Greek-particularly those based on authentic, native-sourced content-remain limited. Existing datasets are often machine-translated from English, failing to capture Greek linguistic and cultural characteristics. We introduce GreekMMLU, a native-sourced benchmark for massive multitask language understanding in Greek, comprising 21,805 multiple-choice questions across 45 subject areas, organized under a newly defined subject taxonomy and annotated with educational difficulty levels spanning primary to professional examinations. All questions are sourced or authored in Greek from academic, professional, and governmental exams. We publicly release 16,857 samples and reserve 4,948 samples for a private leaderboard to enable robust and contamination-resistant evaluation. Evaluations of over 80 open- and closed-source LLMs reveal substantial performance gaps between frontier and open-weight models, as well as between Greek-adapted models and general multilingual ones. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of factors influencing performance-including model scale, adaptation, and prompting-and derive insights for improving LLM capabilities in Greek.

*Ziyuan Yang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines multi-LLM collaborative systems, revealing vulnerabilities posed by malicious models, quantifies their impact, and proposes mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety risks associated with decentralized multi-LLM collaboration systems where malicious models may compromise system performance.

Method: Engineered four categories of malicious LMs and tested them in diverse collaborative systems on 10 datasets, followed by proposing external supervisor strategies to mitigate their influence.

Result: Malicious models severely degrade performance by 7.12%-7.94% in reasoning/safety domains; mitigation recovers 95.31% of performance.

Conclusion: Malicious models pose significant risks to multi-LLM systems, and while mitigation strategies are effective in reducing impact, full resistance to malicious models is still an open research issue.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used in collaboration: multiple LMs trained by different parties collaborate through routing systems, multi-agent debate, model merging, and more. Critical safety risks remain in this decentralized paradigm: what if some of the models in multi-LLM systems are compromised or malicious? We first quantify the impact of malicious models by engineering four categories of malicious LMs, plug them into four types of popular model collaboration systems, and evaluate the compromised system across 10 datasets. We find that malicious models have a severe impact on the multi-LLM systems, especially for reasoning and safety domains where performance is lowered by 7.12% and 7.94% on average. We then propose mitigation strategies to alleviate the impact of malicious components, by employing external supervisors that oversee model collaboration to disable/mask them out to reduce their influence. On average, these strategies recover 95.31% of the initial performance, while making model collaboration systems fully resistant to malicious models remains an open research question.

*Shangbin Feng,Kishan Panaganti,Yulia Tsvetkov,Wenhao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes distilling collaborative patterns from multiple language models into a single model for efficient inference, with a new evolutionary loop process to further improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of diverse language models in collaboration systems while reducing computational costs associated with running multiple models.

Method: The method involves distilling collaborative model outputs into a single model for inference and introduces a single-multi evolution loop where models repeatedly collaborate and distill outputs to evolve and improve performance.

Result: Experiments across 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks show individual model improvements of 8% on average and collaboration improvements of 14.9% after introducing the evolution loop.

Conclusion: Distilling collaborative efforts enhances single-model efficiency, and the proposed evolution loop improves both individual models and collaborative systems, outperforming other evolutionary AI methods and enabling solutions to challenging problems.

Abstract: Model collaboration -- systems where multiple language models (LMs) collaborate -- combines the strengths of diverse models with cost in loading multiple LMs. We improve efficiency while preserving the strengths of collaboration by distilling collaborative patterns into a single model, where the model is trained on the outputs of the model collaboration system. At inference time, only the distilled model is employed: it imitates the collaboration while only incurring the cost of a single model. Furthermore, we propose the single-multi evolution loop: multiple LMs collaborate, each distills from the collaborative outputs, and these post-distillation improved LMs collaborate again, forming a collective evolution ecosystem where models evolve and self-improve by interacting with an environment of other models. Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average. Analysis reveals that the single-multi evolution loop outperforms various existing evolutionary AI methods, is compatible with diverse model/collaboration/distillation settings, and helps solve problems where the initial model/system struggles to.

*Hsuan-Yu Chou,Wajiha Naveed,Shuyan Zhou,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of open-weight LLMs in harmful content detection for social media moderation, comparing them with proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the growing need for effective social media moderation as internet access expands, and the open question of whether open-weight LLMs can match the performance of proprietary models in harmful content detection.

Method: The researchers tested seven state-of-the-art LLMs (four proprietary and three open-weight) using real-world posts from Bluesky, Bluesky's moderation decisions, and author annotations. Sensitivity and specificity metrics were analyzed for their performance.

Result: Open-weight LLMs showed sensitivity scores of 81%--97% and specificity scores of 91%--100%, which overlap significantly with the performance of proprietary LLMs (72%--98% sensitivity, 93%--99% specificity). Differences in sensitivity and specificity were noted for rudeness, intolerance, and threats.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs can be effectively used for privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware, presenting opportunities to balance community and individual user preferences in moderation systems.

Abstract: As internet access expands, so does exposure to harmful content, increasing the need for effective moderation. Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.
  Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.

### [86] [Aligning Large Language Model Behavior with Human Citation Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05205)
*Kenichiro Ando,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness, compares their citation behaviors to human preferences, and proposes methods to better align LLM citation handling with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the growing interest in ensuring credibility in LLM outputs with citation links and evaluating alignment between human expectations and machine citation behavior.

Method: The method involves constructing a dataset categorizing texts into eight citation-motivation types and analyzing human citation preferences versus LLM behavior. Pairwise citation preferences were exhaustively compared, alongside experiments with Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: The study revealed gaps in citation alignment, such as overcitation of marked texts (e.g., Wikipedia) and undercitation for numeric sentences and personal names, alongside demonstrating that model calibration can enhance alignment with human preferences.

Conclusion: A better understanding of LLM citation choices can improve alignment accuracy with human citation preferences, paving the way for refined LLM citation systems.

Abstract: Most services built on powerful large-scale language models (LLMs) add citations to their output to enhance credibility. Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences. We expect this study to provide a foundation for more fine-grained investigations into LLM citation preferences.

*Hongye Zhao,Yi Zhao,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the evolving knowledge proximity between academia and industry, focusing on fine-grained analysis rather than macro-level indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fine-grained examination of knowledge proximity in academia-industry collaboration, often overshadowed by reliance on macro indicators like collaborative papers and patents.

Method: The study extracts and analyzes fine-grained knowledge entities using pre-trained models, cosine similarity, complex network analysis, and unsupervised contrastive learning to assess semantic space convergence and cross-institution textual similarities.

Result: The analysis shows increasing knowledge proximity between academia and industry, particularly after technological changes, alongside weakening knowledge dominance of academia during paradigm shifts.

Conclusion: This research highlights academia-industry co-evolution and adaptation trends, and the findings contribute to improving collaboration frameworks and resource allocation. Comprehensive datasets and codes are made publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bagpiper is an 8B audio foundation model utilizing rich captions for general audio understanding and generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio models focus on isolated factors of audio, contrasting with human intelligence, which processes holistically. A holistic approach for audio understanding and generation is needed.

Method: Bagpiper uses an 8B-parameter architecture pre-trained on 600B tokens, establishing a bidirectional mapping between raw audio and rich natural language descriptions. It employs caption-then-process workflows, simulating cognitive reasoning.

Result: Bagpiper outperformed Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding, and surpassed CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, successfully synthesizing diverse audio compositions.

Conclusion: Bagpiper achieved unified audio understanding and generation, bridging physical audio signals with abstract concepts effectively. It is a new benchmark for audio foundation models.

Abstract: Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.

*Zhilin Liang,Yuxiang Wang,Zimu Zhou,Hainan Zhang,Boyi Liu,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedMosaic, a federated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses parametric adapters to address privacy challenges in distributed knowledge settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable RAG-based AI systems to operate in privacy-sensitive domains without sharing raw documents, overcoming traditional centralized corpus constraints.

Method: FedMosaic reduces storage and communication overhead by clustering related documents in parametric adapters and selectively aggregates relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters.

Result: FedMosaic achieves a 10.9% increase in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing storage (78.8%-86.3%) and communication costs (91.4%), without sharing raw text.

Conclusion: FedMosaic effectively addresses storage, communication, and aggregation challenges in federated RAG setups, ensuring efficient operation while maintaining privacy protections.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.

TL;DR: A system called Copyright Detective is introduced to identify and analyze copyright risks in outputs from large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex issue of detecting and auditing copyright risks in LLM outputs due to the challenges of copyright law and current detection approaches.

Method: The system uses multiple detection methods such as content recall testing, paraphrase similarity analysis, jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification within an interactive and extensible framework.

Result: Copyright Detective enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase leakage, supporting responsible LLM usage even for black-box models.

Conclusion: This tool provides practical solutions for identifying and managing copyright risks, promoting transparent and responsible deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: We present Copyright Detective, the first interactive forensic system for detecting, analyzing, and visualizing potential copyright risks in LLM outputs. The system treats copyright infringement versus compliance as an evidence discovery process rather than a static classification task due to the complex nature of copyright law. It integrates multiple detection paradigms, including content recall testing, paraphrase-level similarity analysis, persuasive jailbreak probing, and unlearning verification, within a unified and extensible framework. Through interactive prompting, response collection, and iterative workflows, our system enables systematic auditing of verbatim memorization and paraphrase-level leakage, supporting responsible deployment and transparent evaluation of LLM copyright risks even with black-box access.

*Haoran Li,Sucheng Ren,Alan Yuille,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPE, a method that refines Rotary Positional Embedding for longer context scaling in Large Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art results up to 256k context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve existing methods for adapting RoPE to longer contexts while unifying out-of-distribution mitigation and semantic modeling goals.

Method: Proposed CoPE: soft clipping low-frequency components of RoPE to reduce OOD outliers, refine semantic signals, and prevent spectral leakage.

Result: CoPE exhibits significant performance gains on extended context lengths, scaling to 256k contexts and surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: Soft clipping in RoPE is effective and positions CoPE as an advanced solution for length generalization in large contexts.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE.

*Fanfan Liu,Youyang Yin,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Zhixiong Zeng,Haibo Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes RLVR algorithms' response length variations and proposes the LUSPO algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art reasoning performance by mitigating length bias issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fundamental understanding of response length variations in RLVR algorithms and to improve reasoning capabilities in tasks with LLMs and VLMs.

Method: The authors provide theoretical and experimental analysis of response length factors and propose LUSPO, which rectifies length bias in GSPO to prevent response length collapse.

Result: LUSPO achieves superior mathematical and multimodal reasoning performance across benchmarks, surpassing existing methods like GRPO and GSPO.

Conclusion: LUSPO resolves the response length bias issue and sets a new state-of-the-art standard for optimization in RLVR applications.

Abstract: Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies limitations in the empirical nature of optimizing MAS with LLMs and proposes a unified, scientific design framework enhancing systematic collaboration optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on Multi-Agent Systems powered by LLMs is constrained by trial-and-error methods and lacks a structured framework for systematic optimization and identification of effective factors.

Method: The paper introduces a collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) to isolate intrinsic benefits from increased budgets and proposes a systematic factor attribution paradigm. It also includes the development of a MAS factor library to categorize design elements.

Result: The framework aims to facilitate the transition from empirical to scientific methods, enhancing the ability to identify key factors driving collaboration.

Conclusion: Establishing the scientific metric and attribution model shifts MAS with LLMs from experimental approaches to a robust foundation for Collective AI, promising principled optimization and progress.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.

*Haojin Wang,Yike Wang,Shangbin Feng,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MentorCollab, a method enabling large reasoning models (LRMs) to selectively guide small language models (SLMs) during inference to achieve efficient and error-reduced multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in reasoning tasks: LRMs, while effective, are costly and often verbose, whereas SLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning despite their efficiency.

Method: MentorCollab selectively probes divergences between LRMs and SLMs at random token positions and uses a lightweight verifier to decide whether SLMs should adopt LRM suggestions or continue independently.

Result: MentorCollab achieved average performance gains of 3.0% (up to 8.0%) during multi-step reasoning across 15 SLM-LRM pairs and three domains, while limiting the reliance on LRMs to 18.4% of tokens generated.

Conclusion: Selective guidance from LRMs can significantly enhance SLM reasoning ability with minimal inference overhead, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.

TL;DR: This study investigates how language models (LMs) encode character-level information without being explicitly programmed for it, analyzing contributing factors linked to tokenization methods and pre-training settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind language models' implicit acquisition of character-level knowledge, which are largely unexplored.

Method: Researchers compared LMs trained under controlled settings (e.g., varying datasets and tokenizers) with those trained under standard conditions, categorizing factors into those influenced or independent of tokenization.

Result: Key factors identified include merge rules and orthographic constraints (related to tokenization), as well as semantic associations and syntactic information (independent of tokenization).

Conclusion: Factors linked to tokenization and independent mechanisms both contribute to character-level encoding in LMs, offering insights into how these models develop deeper linguistic knowledge.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have been reported to implicitly encode character-level information, despite not being explicitly provided during training. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. To reveal the mechanisms, we analyze how models acquire character-level knowledge by comparing LMs trained under controlled settings, such as specifying the pre-training dataset or tokenizer, with those trained under standard settings. We categorize the contributing factors into those independent of tokenization. Our analysis reveals that merge rules and orthographic constraints constitute primary factors arising from tokenization, whereas semantic associations of substrings and syntactic information function as key factors independent of tokenization.

### [96] [PACE: Defying the Scaling Hypothesis of Exploration in Iterative Alignment for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05370)
*Jun Rao,Zixiong Yu,Xuebo Liu,Guhan Chen,Jing Li,Jiansheng Wei,Xiaojun Meng,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACE (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), a method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks, which avoids brute-force sampling and uses a minimal budget to outperform traditional methods with greater efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to align LLMs on reasoning tasks use aggressive exploration that can lead to diminishing returns and even performance degradation.

Method: The authors propose PACE, which employs a generation-based corrective strategy instead of brute-force sampling, focusing on synthesizing preference pairs from failed exploration with a minimal computational budget.

Result: PACE outperforms traditional methods, such as DPO-R1 with Best-of-N sampling, using only about 1/5 of the compute while demonstrating greater robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

Conclusion: Aggressive exploration is not always beneficial, and PACE proves that a minimal-budget corrective strategy can achieve superior performance and robustness, challenging traditional scaling hypotheses in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Iterative Direct Preference Optimization has emerged as the state-of-the-art paradigm for aligning Large Language Models on reasoning tasks. Standard implementations (DPO-R1) rely on Best-of-N sampling (e.g., $N \ge 8$) to mine golden trajectories from the distribution tail. In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations. Empirical evaluations show that PACE outperforms DPO-R1 $(N=16)$ while using only about $1/5$ of the compute, demonstrating superior robustness against reward hacking and label noise.

TL;DR: A study reveals performance gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to Arabic versus English medical question-answering tasks, calling for language-aware design strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language affects LLM reliability in medical applications, particularly in addressing performance gaps in low-resource languages like Arabic.

Method: The authors conducted a cross-lingual analysis comparing LLM performance on Arabic and English in medical question-answering tasks, performing tokenization and reliability analyses.

Result: The study found intensified language-driven performance gaps with task complexity, structural issues with Arabic tokenization, and weak correlations between model confidence/explanations and correctness.

Conclusion: Effective and inclusive LLM applications in medical fields require language-aware strategies to mitigate disparities in low-resource languages like Arabic.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used in medical applications, such as clinical decision support, medical education, and medical question answering. Yet, these models are often English-centric, limiting their robustness and reliability for linguistically diverse communities. Recent work has highlighted discrepancies in performance in low-resource languages for various medical tasks, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering. Our findings reveal a persistent language-driven performance gap that intensifies with increasing task complexity. Tokenization analysis exposes structural fragmentation in Arabic medical text, while reliability analysis suggests that model-reported confidence and explanations exhibit limited correlation with correctness. Together, these findings underscore the need for language-aware design and evaluation strategies in LLMs for medical tasks.

Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, hypothetical queries, and costly enterprise deployment.

Method: The authors propose the IESR framework, leveraging LLMs for schema linking, using Monte Carlo Tree Search with majority voting, and introducing a trajectory consistency verification module.

Result: IESR achieves state-of-the-art results on the LogicCat (24.28 EX) and Archer (37.28 EX) datasets using lightweight models, without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper showcases IESR's capability in addressing high-complexity Text-to-SQL issues using cost-effective lightweight models, and highlights areas for future research such as biases in coder models and limitations in reasoning.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a key natural language processing task that maps natural language questions to SQL queries, enabling intuitive interaction with web-based databases. Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

*Jiyun Chun,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White,Andrew Perrault*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework using large language models (LLMs) to more effectively evaluate the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogues based on conversational context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for assessing children's speech focus heavily on factors like length and lexical variety while neglecting key factors such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning.

Method: The authors introduce an LLM-as-a-judge system that classifies adult utterances and scores children's responses along two dimensions: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (advancing the discourse autonomously).

Result: Their metrics reveal developmental patterns, improve age estimation over traditional metrics, and align well with human evaluations, showing semantic sensitivity to discourse relations.

Conclusion: This framework advances the assessment of children's speech by shifting focus from superficial metrics to meaningful contributions in conversational context, enabling nuanced evaluations at a large scale.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of children's utterances in adult-child dialogue remains challenging due to insufficient context-sensitive metrics. Common proxies such as Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), lexical diversity (vocd-D), and readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index) are dominated by length and ignore conversational context, missing aspects of response quality such as reasoning depth, topic maintenance, and discourse planning. We introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework that first classifies the Previous Adult Utterance Type and then scores the child's response along two axes: Expansion (contextual elaboration and inferential depth) and Independence (the child's contribution to advancing the discourse). These axes reflect fundamental dimensions in child language development, where Expansion captures elaboration, clause combining, and causal and contrastive connectives. Independence captures initiative, topic control, decreasing reliance on adult scaffolding through growing self-regulation, and audience design. We establish developmental validity by showing age-related patterns and demonstrate predictive value by improving age estimation over common baselines. We further confirm semantic sensitivity by detecting differences tied to discourse relations. Our metrics align with human judgments, enabling large-scale evaluation. This shifts child utterance assessment from simply measuring length to evaluating how meaningfully the child's speech contributes to and advances the conversation within its context.

*Ji Zhao,Yufei Gu,Shitong Shao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Zeke Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm to accelerate large language model training by leveraging smaller pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computational prohibitive nature of pretraining large language models and explore leveraging smaller pretrained models to accelerate training.

Method: The LET paradigm involves guiding early layers during early training using representations from later layers of a pretrained model, introducing two mechanisms: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning.

Result: Experiments show LET significantly accelerates convergence, improves language modeling and task performance. A 1.4B parameter model training on the Pile dataset achieved up to 1.6x speedup with 5% accuracy improvement using a pretrained model with 10x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: LET showcases the potential to reduce training time and enhance performance in large language models by effectively utilizing pretrained smaller models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\times$ speedup with nearly 5\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.

TL;DR: OPUS optimizes data selection in pre-training by leveraging optimizer-induced updates, achieving superior performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exhaustion of high-quality public text (Data Wall) prompts the need for pre-training methods that focus on better tokens rather than more tokens.

Method: OPUS introduces a dynamic data selection framework that scores candidates based on optimizer-induced updates, employing techniques like Ghost with CountSketch for efficiency.

Result: OPUS achieves superior results across diverse settings, outperforming industrial baselines in token efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: OPUS enhances pre-training effectiveness by optimizing data selection, enabling greater efficiency in both general and specialized domains.

Abstract: As high-quality public text approaches exhaustion, a phenomenon known as the Data Wall, pre-training is shifting from more tokens to better tokens. However, existing methods either rely on heuristic static filters that ignore training dynamics, or use dynamic yet optimizer-agnostic criteria based on raw gradients. We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.

*Takumi Goto,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces UOT-ERRANT, a novel metric for grammatical error correction evaluation, which leverages edit representations and optimal transport, improving evaluation accuracy particularly in fluency domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address limitations in current reference-based metrics for GEC that focus on similarity measures like BERTScore, which are often ineffective when many words remain unchanged.

Method: The study proposes an edit vector representation specifically for GEC edits and uses unbalanced optimal transport to compute similarities through a new metric called UOT-ERRANT.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that UOT-ERRANT outperforms existing metrics in the +Fluency domain and provides interpretable insights into edit alignments.

Conclusion: UOT-ERRANT offers better performance in GEC evaluation, particularly in fluency-oriented tasks, and enhances system ranking and analysis with its interpretable transport framework.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation in grammatical error correction (GEC) is crucial for selecting the best-performing systems. Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems. Our code is available from https://github.com/gotutiyan/uot-errant.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces M2CQA, a benchmark focused on evaluating hallucination in vision-language models (VLMs) across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts, particularly in the MENA region, and proposes a new metric for measuring hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing benchmarks that fail to test VLM failure modes in non-Western and non-English contexts and to identify how VLMs handle culturally plausible but visually incorrect content.

Method: The authors developed a dataset (M2CQA) including images from 17 MENA countries with contrastive statements in both English and Arabic (including dialects). They introduced a metric called CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR) to assess hallucinations in VLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs show increased hallucination rates in Arabic, particularly with dialects, despite maintaining high accuracy on true statements. Reasoning-first prompting escalates hallucination, whereas answering before justifying enhances robustness.

Conclusion: Current VLMs face significant challenges in culturally diverse and multilingual contexts, with a need for improved robustness to reduce hallucinations. The data and experimental tools will be shared to support further research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can achieve high accuracy while still accepting culturally plausible but visually incorrect interpretations. Existing hallucination benchmarks rarely test this failure mode, particularly outside Western contexts and English. We introduce M2CQA, a culturally grounded multimodal benchmark built from images spanning 17 MENA countries, paired with contrastive true and counterfactual statements in English, Arabic, and its dialects. To isolate hallucination beyond raw accuracy, we propose the CounterFactual Hallucination Rate (CFHR), which measures counterfactual acceptance conditioned on correctly answering the true statement. Evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs under multiple prompting strategies, we find that CFHR rises sharply in Arabic, especially in dialects, even when true-statement accuracy remains high. Moreover, reasoning-first prompting consistently increases counterfactual hallucination, while answering before justifying improves robustness. We will make the experimental resources and dataset publicly available for the community.

### [104] [Causal Front-Door Adjustment for Robust Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05444)
*Yao Zhou,Zeen Song,Wenwen Qiang,Fengge Wu,Shuyi Zhou,Changwen Zheng,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CFA^2, a causal attack framework to bypass safety mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) using sparse autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore and model LLM safety mechanisms as hidden confounders to reveal and enhance their latent capabilities.

Method: Design CFA^2 attack framework using Pearl's Front-Door Criterion and Sparse Autoencoders to remove defense-related features.

Result: Achieved high attack success rates while providing explanations for the jailbreaking process.

Conclusion: CFA^2 is an effective and interpretable framework for jailbreaking LLMs by disentangling confounding safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) often operate as latent internal states, obscuring the model's inherent capabilities. Building on this observation, we model the safety mechanism as an unobserved confounder from a causal perspective. Then, we propose the \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{F}ront-Door \textbf{A}djustment \textbf{A}ttack ({\textbf{CFA}}$^2$) to jailbreak LLM, which is a framework that leverages Pearl's Front-Door Criterion to sever the confounding associations for robust jailbreaking. Specifically, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to physically strip defense-related features, isolating the core task intent. We further reduce computationally expensive marginalization to a deterministic intervention with low inference complexity. Experiments demonstrate that {CFA}$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while offering a mechanistic interpretation of the jailbreaking process.

### [105] [Structured Context Engineering for File-Native Agentic Systems: Evaluating Schema Accuracy, Format Effectiveness, and Multi-File Navigation at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05447)
*Damon McMillan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how Large Language Model agents operate with structured data, focusing on SQL generation. It challenges assumptions about context structuring, with findings about architecture, format, and model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide empirical guidance for practitioners on structuring context for Large Language Model agents interacting with external systems.

Method: 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats, and schemas of varying size, using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent tasks.

Result: Key results indicate architecture choice varies by model; format effects are minimal overall but sensitive for specific models; model capability is the most influential factor; large-scale schemas are navigable, and compact formats can be inefficient at runtime.

Conclusion: Practitioners should tailor architectural decisions to model capabilities rather than rely on universal best practices for deploying LLM agents on structured systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents increasingly operate external systems through programmatic interfaces, yet practitioners lack empirical guidance on how to structure the context these agents consume. Using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent operations, we present a systematic study of context engineering for structured data, comprising 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats (YAML, Markdown, JSON, Token-Oriented Object Notation [TOON]), and schemas ranging from 10 to 10,000 tables.
  Our findings challenge common assumptions. First, architecture choice is model-dependent: file-based context retrieval improves accuracy for frontier-tier models (Claude, GPT, Gemini; +2.7%, p=0.029) but shows mixed results for open source models (aggregate -7.7%, p<0.001), with deficits varying substantially by model. Second, format does not significantly affect aggregate accuracy (chi-squared=2.45, p=0.484), though individual models, particularly open source, exhibit format-specific sensitivities. Third, model capability is the dominant factor, with a 21 percentage point accuracy gap between frontier and open source tiers that dwarfs any format or architecture effect. Fourth, file-native agents scale to 10,000 tables through domain-partitioned schemas while maintaining high navigation accuracy. Fifth, file size does not predict runtime efficiency: compact formats can consume significantly more tokens at scale due to format-unfamiliar search patterns.
  These findings provide practitioners with evidence-based guidance for deploying LLM agents on structured systems, demonstrating that architectural decisions should be tailored to model capability rather than assuming universal best practices.

### [106] [Reasoning under Ambiguity: Uncertainty-Aware Multilingual Emotion Classification under Partial Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05471)
*Md. Mithun Hossaina,Mashary N. Alrasheedy,Nirban Bhowmick,Shamim Forhad,Md. Shakil Hossain,Sudipto Chaki,Md Shafiqul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual emotion classification, addressing challenges like annotation ambiguity and partial supervision to enhance robustness, interpretability, and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenges of emotional ambiguity, co-occurrence of multiple emotional states, and incomplete or inconsistent emotion annotations, which hinder reliable multilingual emotion identification in knowledge-based systems.

Method: The proposed framework employs a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization, an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism to handle ambiguity, and a mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization to address partial supervision.

Result: Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion datasets show consistent improvements over baselines, better robustness to sparse annotations, enhanced stability during training, and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework excels in multilingual emotion identification by aligning learning with annotation uncertainty and provides a reliable and interpretable approach to emotion classification under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.

### [108] [Transport and Merge: Cross-Architecture Merging for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05495)
*Chenhang Cui,Binyun Yang,Fei Shen,Yuxin Chen,Jingnan Zheng,Xiang Wang,An Zhang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for transferring knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to smaller models with different architectures using optimal transport, improving performance in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world usage often relies on smaller models trained on low-resource data, creating a need to transfer knowledge from larger LLMs to heterogeneous smaller models effectively.

Method: The framework utilizes optimal transport to align activations between large and smaller heterogeneous models, facilitating weight-space fusion for knowledge transfer with limited input data.

Result: Experiments on low-resource languages and specialized domains show consistent improvements in the performance of the target models after applying the proposed method.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture model merging based on optimal transport is shown to be an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models, enhancing capabilities in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong capabilities by scaling model capacity and training data, yet many real-world deployments rely on smaller models trained or adapted from low-resource data. This gap motivates the need for mechanisms to transfer knowledge from large, high-resource models to smaller, low-resource targets. While model merging provides an effective transfer mechanism, most existing approaches assume architecture-compatible models and therefore cannot directly transfer knowledge from large high-resource LLMs to heterogeneous low-resource targets. In this work, we propose a cross-architecture merging framework based on optimal transport (OT) that aligns activations to infer cross-neuron correspondences between heterogeneous models. The resulting transport plans are then used to guide direct weight-space fusion, enabling effective high-resource to low-resource transfer using only a small set of inputs. Extensive experiments across low-resource languages and specialized domains demonstrate consistent improvements over target models.

*Larissa Pusch,Alexandre Courtiol,Tim Conrad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for LLMs to generate and explain queries on knowledge graphs (KGs), allowing iterative refinement by users and improving access to complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in language tasks yet struggle with knowledge-intensive applications due to hallucinations, lack of explainability, and reliance on text-based retrieval augmented generation, which is insufficient for multi-hop reasoning.

Method: This framework enables LLMs to generate Cypher graph queries with explainability, allowing users to iteratively refine them using natural language on real-world knowledge graphs.

Result: It improves accessibility to structured datasets, enhances factual accuracy, and provides insights into LLM performance. Evaluation includes a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG and smaller experiments on other real-world KGs.

Conclusion: The interactive framework supports more accurate, explainable, and user-friendly querying of KGs, bridging the gap between LLMs and complex knowledge datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MT-GRPO to address the imbalance and inefficiency issues in multi-task RL-based language model optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure balanced and reliable performance across diverse tasks in real-world deployment.

Method: MT-GRPO dynamically adjusts task weights to optimize worst-task performance and uses a ratio-preserving sampler for effective optimization.

Result: The algorithm improves worst-task performance by 16-28% over GRPO and 6% over DAPO, and reduces training steps for achieving target accuracy by 50%.

Conclusion: MT-GRPO enhances reliability and efficiency in multi-task settings, achieving balanced task performance with competitive average accuracy.

Abstract: RL-based post-training with GRPO is widely used to improve large language models on individual reasoning tasks. However, real-world deployment requires reliable performance across diverse tasks. A straightforward multi-task adaptation of GRPO often leads to imbalanced outcomes, with some tasks dominating optimization while others stagnate. Moreover, tasks can vary widely in how frequently prompts yield zero advantages (and thus zero gradients), which further distorts their effective contribution to the optimization signal. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Task GRPO (MT-GRPO) algorithm that (i) dynamically adapts task weights to explicitly optimize worst-task performance and promote balanced progress across tasks, and (ii) introduces a ratio-preserving sampler to ensure task-wise policy gradients reflect the adapted weights. Experiments on both 3-task and 9-task settings show that MT-GRPO consistently outperforms baselines in worst-task accuracy. In particular, MT-GRPO achieves 16-28% and 6% absolute improvement on worst-task performance over standard GRPO and DAPO, respectively, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Moreover, MT-GRPO requires 50% fewer training steps to reach 50% worst-task accuracy in the 3-task setting, demonstrating substantially improved efficiency in achieving reliable performance across tasks.

*Rui Jia,Ruiyi Lan,Fengrui Liu,Zhongxiang Dai,Bo Jiang,Jing Shao,Jingyuan Chen,Guandong Xu,Fei Wu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CASTLE, a benchmark to evaluate personalized safety in educational AI models by considering student-specific attributes and educational risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language models provide generic responses without accounting for diverse student cognitive and psychological traits, which may lead to safety risks. Current safety evaluations are inadequate for capturing personalized interactions.

Method: The paper presents CASTLE, a benchmark covering 15 educational risks and 14 student attributes, with 92,908 scenarios, along with new evaluation metrics such as Risk Sensitivity, Emotional Empathy, and Student Alignment.

Result: Experiments on 18 state-of-the-art LLMs show poor performance in safety assurance, with average safety scores below 2.3 out of 5.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in addressing personalized safety in education, highlighting the need for more tailored and empathetic approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.

*Giuseppe Samo,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how transformer models process complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, highlighting the impact of tokenization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how transformer models handle languages with complex morphological systems, such as Turkish and Modern Hebrew, and the role tokenization plays in this process.

Method: The authors used the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural and synthetic data to evaluate transformer models with different tokenization strategies, in both monolingual and multilingual contexts.

Result: Monolingual and multilingual models succeeded in Turkish due to its transparent morphology. For Hebrew, monolingual models with morpheme-aware segmentation performed better, while multilingual models with character-level tokenization failed. Synthetic datasets improved performance for all models.

Conclusion: Tokenization strategies and language morphology play a key role in transformer models' ability to effectively learn and represent complex verb paradigms, with better results seen in languages with clear morphological segmentation or tailored tokenization approaches.

Abstract: We investigate how transformer models represent complex verb paradigms in Turkish and Modern Hebrew, concentrating on how tokenization strategies shape this ability. Using the Blackbird Language Matrices task on natural data, we show that for Turkish -- with its transparent morphological markers -- both monolingual and multilingual models succeed, either when tokenization is atomic or when it breaks words into small subword units. For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well. Performance improves on more synthetic datasets, in all models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the critical need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, particularly in error detection, as inaccuracies in clinical text can lead to harmful effects. Multilingual and contextualized datasets for such evaluations are scarce.

Method: The authors developed MedErrBench, a multilingual benchmark annotated by domain experts, focusing on common clinical error types across languages (English, Arabic, Chinese). They evaluated multiple models using this benchmark.

Result: The study found significant performance gaps in LLMs, particularly in non-English languages, demonstrating shortcomings in current clinical language models for multilingual settings.

Conclusion: MedErrBench is proposed as a vital resource for advancing multilingual clinical NLP and ensuring safer AI applications in healthcare. The benchmark and evaluations aim to address global language and equity gaps in clinical NLP systems.

Abstract: Inaccuracies in existing or generated clinical text may lead to serious adverse consequences, especially if it is a misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment suggestion. With Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly being used across diverse healthcare applications, comprehensive evaluation through dedicated benchmarks is crucial. However, such datasets remain scarce, especially across diverse languages and contexts. In this paper, we introduce MedErrBench, the first multilingual benchmark for error detection, localization, and correction, developed under the guidance of experienced clinicians. Based on an expanded taxonomy of ten common error types, MedErrBench covers English, Arabic and Chinese, with natural clinical cases annotated and reviewed by domain experts. We assessed the performance of a range of general-purpose, language-specific, and medical-domain language models across all three tasks. Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in non-English settings, highlighting the need for clinically grounded, language-aware systems. By making MedErrBench and our evaluation protocols publicly-available, we aim to advance multilingual clinical NLP to promote safer and more equitable AI-based healthcare globally.

*Shuting Jiang,Ran Song,Yuxin Huang,Yan Xiang,Yantuan Xian,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a neuron-efficient fine-tuning approach for multi-domain machine translation (MDMT), overcoming issues like domain shift and parameter interference, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MDMT techniques face challenges like domain adaptation, interference, and limited generalization when using large language models (LLMs).

Method: The proposed framework pinpoints and updates neurons within LLMs by maximizing mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, ensuring efficient fine-tuning and balanced adaptations.

Result: Successful experiments on three LLMs across ten domains demonstrated significant performance improvements on both known and new domains, surpassing current methods.

Conclusion: This neuron-focused fine-tuning strategy effectively enhances multi-domain translation quality and mitigates common issues in domain adaptation, marking a step forward in MDMT.

Abstract: Multi-domain machine translation (MDMT) aims to build a unified model capable of translating content across diverse domains. Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: OmniMoE is a framework introducing fine-grained atomic experts to improve parameter efficiency in Mixture-of-Experts architectures, achieving high accuracy and significantly reducing inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between expert granularity and hardware execution efficiency in existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs.

Method: OmniMoE introduces Atomic Experts and employs a system-algorithm co-design with a Cartesian Product Router for reducing routing complexity and Expert-Centric Scheduling for efficient execution.

Result: OmniMoE achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across benchmarks, surpasses baselines like DeepSeekMoE and PEER, and reduces inference latency by 10.9-fold compared to PEER.

Conclusion: OmniMoE demonstrates that fine-grained MoE architectures can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, pushing the boundaries of scalability in these designs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are evolving towards finer granularity to improve parameter efficiency. However, existing MoE designs face an inherent trade-off between the granularity of expert specialization and hardware execution efficiency. We propose OmniMoE, a system-algorithm co-designed framework that pushes expert granularity to its logical extreme. OmniMoE introduces vector-level Atomic Experts, enabling scalable routing and execution within a single MoE layer, while retaining a shared dense MLP branch for general-purpose processing. Although this atomic design maximizes capacity, it poses severe challenges for routing complexity and memory access. To address these, OmniMoE adopts a system-algorithm co-design: (i) a Cartesian Product Router that decomposes the massive index space to reduce routing complexity from O(N) to O(sqrt(N)); and (ii) Expert-Centric Scheduling that inverts the execution order to turn scattered, memory-bound lookups into efficient dense matrix operations. Validated on seven benchmarks, OmniMoE (with 1.7B active parameters) achieves 50.9% zero-shot accuracy across seven benchmarks, outperforming coarse-grained (e.g., DeepSeekMoE) and fine-grained (e.g., PEER) baselines. Crucially, OmniMoE reduces inference latency from 73ms to 6.7ms (a 10.9-fold speedup) compared to PEER, demonstrating that massive-scale fine-grained MoE can be fast and accurate.

*Hao Yang,Zhiyu Yang,Xupeng Zhang,Wei Wei,Yunjie Zhang,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents CompactRAG, a cost-efficient multi-hop Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that minimizes inefficiencies in large language model (LLM) use by restructuring knowledge offline and limiting LLM calls in online processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-hop RAG systems are inefficient, with excessive LLM calls, high token consumption, and inconsistent entity grounding across reasoning hops.

Method: CompactRAG restructures knowledge into an atomic QA knowledge base offline using an LLM and uses dense retrieval and RoBERTa-based answer extraction online, involving only two LLM calls during inference.

Result: CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue datasets while significantly reducing token consumption compared to traditional iterative RAG systems.

Conclusion: CompactRAG presents an effective and practical framework for multi-hop question answering, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for knowledge-intensive question answering. However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.
  In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.
  Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora. The implementation is available at GitHub.

*Bowen Ping,Zijun Chen,Yiyao Yu,Tingfeng Hui,Junchi Yan,Baobao Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes LongR, a framework for improving long-context reasoning in reinforcement learning by incorporating a dynamic reasoning mechanism and a contextual density reward, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from existing challenges in long-context scenarios, such as consuming tokens and performing thorough deduction, coupled with the limitations of relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards.

Method: The LongR framework integrates a 'Think-and-Read' reasoning mechanism with document consultation and employs a contextual density reward quantifying relevant information gain.

Result: LongR achieves a 9% performance improvement on LongBench v2 and shows consistent enhancements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robustness across various reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed LongR framework enhances long-context performance efficiently and is robust against distractors, offering consistent gains across different RL scenarios and algorithms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a key driver for LLM reasoning. This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.

*Adnan Al Ali,Jindřich Helcl,Jindřich Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study revisits claims about biases in LLM-generated text detectors, specifically for the Czech language. It disproves the assumption that non-native speakers' texts have lower perplexity and finds no bias from modern detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the misuse of LLM-based assistants in academics, especially regarding their detection methods which might unfairly flag non-native speakers' texts.

Method: The study analyzed the perplexity of texts written by native and non-native Czech speakers, tested three types of detector tools, and evaluated their reliance on perplexity.

Result: Texts from non-native speakers showed no lower perplexity than those from native speakers. All evaluated detectors did not exhibit systematic bias against non-native speakers. Contemporary detectors also performed well without relying on perplexity.

Conclusion: Previous assumptions about biases in LLM-detection models against non-native speakers are not valid for Czech, and detectors have improved over time without depending on perplexity-based assessments.

Abstract: LLM-based assistants have been widely popularised after the release of ChatGPT. Concerns have been raised about their misuse in academia, given the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and generated text. To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers. Finally, we demonstrate that contemporary detectors operate effectively without relying on perplexity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML) to improve the performance of LLMs in agentic tasks by creating action-conditioned world models through self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of LLMs in agentic settings where they struggle to anticipate action outcomes and adapt to environment dynamics, requiring enhanced world-modeling capabilities.

Method: This paper proposes the RWML method, a self-supervised learning approach that aligns simulated next states by LLMs with actual environmental states using sim-to-real gap rewards, ensuring semantic equivalence instead of token-level reproduction.

Result: The proposed method showed significant performance gains compared to the base LLM model. Combined with task-success rewards, RWML significantly outperformed direct RL approaches and matched expert-data trained models on ALFWorld and τ² Bench tasks.

Conclusion: RWML provides a robust alternative for training LLM-based agents, enhancing their capacity to model the world and improving their adaptability in agentic environments, with superior performance and resistance to reward hacking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in language-centric tasks. However, in agentic settings, LLMs often struggle to anticipate action consequences and adapt to environment dynamics, highlighting the need for world-modeling capabilities in LLM-based agents. We propose Reinforcement World Model Learning (RWML), a self-supervised method that learns action-conditioned world models for LLM-based agents on textual states using sim-to-real gap rewards. Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OdysseyArena, a platform and benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive and long-horizon capabilities of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of autonomous agents focus on short-term tasks with explicit rules and goals, ignoring the critical ability for agents to discover latent transition dynamics through inductive reasoning and long-term interaction.

Method: The paper presents OdysseyArena, which includes four primitives that translate abstract dynamics into interactive scenarios. It offers two components: OdysseyArena-Lite (standardized benchmarking with 120 tasks) and OdysseyArena-Challenge (extreme-long-horizon evaluation).

Result: Experiments on over 15 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal performance deficiencies in inductive and long-horizon contexts. These findings underscore a major limitation in the current design of large-scale language model-based agents.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved modeling techniques in LLMs to enhance their inductive reasoning and long-horizon discovery capabilities. OdysseyArena serves as a valuable tool to identify and address these shortcomings.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

*Siran Liu,Guoxia Wang,Sa Wang,Jinle Zeng,HaoYang Xie,Siyu Lou,JiaBin Yang,DianHai Yu,Haifeng Wang,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RRAttention is introduced to address the quadratic complexity issue of attention mechanisms in processing long contexts, achieving efficiency and high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of dynamic sparse attention methods such as preprocessing demands, violation of query independence, lack of global evaluation, and computational overhead.

Method: Introduced a head round-robin strategy for dynamic sparse attention, reducing complexity and ensuring query independence while enabling global pattern recognition using stride-level aggregation and adaptive Top-$\tau$ selection.

Result: RRAttention achieves over 99% performance recovery of full attention while reducing computation by half, with a 2.4× speedup at 128K context length compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: RRAttention effectively balances efficiency and performance in handling large contexts, making it superior to alternative sparse attention techniques.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms poses a critical bottleneck for large language models processing long contexts. While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \underline{r}ound-\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.

*Adrián Girón,Pablo Miralles,Javier Huertas-Tato,Sergio D'Antonio,David Camacho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces xList-Hate, a model decomposing hate speech detection into interpretable concept-level questions, improving robustness and interpretability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hate speech detection models struggle with robustness due to dataset-specific definitions and issues like annotation noise and domain shifts.

Method: xList-Hate uses a checklist of concept-level questions answered by a large language model (LLM). The answers form binary diagnostic representations, further processed by a decision tree for interpretable predictions.

Result: xList-Hate shows consistent robustness across datasets, better handling domain shifts and annotation issues compared to supervised and zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Diagnosing hate speech through modular reasoning and interpretable decision paths offers a better alternative for robust, explainable, and auditable content moderation.

Abstract: Hate speech detection is commonly framed as a direct binary classification problem despite being a composite concept defined through multiple interacting factors that vary across legal frameworks, platform policies, and annotation guidelines. As a result, supervised models often overfit dataset-specific definitions and exhibit limited robustness under domain shift and annotation noise.
  We introduce xList-Hate, a diagnostic framework that decomposes hate speech detection into a checklist of explicit, concept-level questions grounded in widely shared normative criteria. Each question is independently answered by a large language model (LLM), producing a binary diagnostic representation that captures hateful content features without directly predicting the final label. These diagnostic signals are then aggregated by a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, yielding transparent and auditable predictions.
  We evaluate it across multiple hate speech benchmarks and model families, comparing it against zero-shot LLM classification and in-domain supervised fine-tuning. While supervised methods typically maximize in-domain performance, we consistently improves cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shift. In addition, qualitative analysis of disagreement cases provides evidence that the framework can be less sensitive to certain forms of annotation inconsistency and contextual ambiguity. Crucially, the approach enables fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis.
  Our results suggest that reframing hate speech detection as a diagnostic reasoning task, rather than a monolithic classification problem, provides a robust, explainable, and extensible alternative for content moderation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses faithfulness issues in small reasoning models when performing chain-of-thought reasoning by introducing Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), which improves reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithfulness hallucinations in intermediate reasoning steps weaken the reliability of small reasoning models for chain-of-thought reasoning, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The paper proposes FaithRL, a reinforcement learning approach combining explicit faithfulness rewards at each reasoning step and truncated resampling to enhance reasoning accuracy.

Result: FaithRL improves faithfulness in intermediate steps and final answers across multiple small reasoning models and QA benchmarks, reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: FaithRL enhances the reliability of small reasoning models in resource-constrained settings, ensuring more faithful reasoning while mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: As large language models become smaller and more efficient, small reasoning models (SRMs) are crucial for enabling chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in resource-constrained settings. However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Codified Finite-State Machines (CFSMs) to enhance role-playing with large language models by modeling latent character states and transitions, ensuring character consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods mainly focus on surface actions in role-playing rather than modeling deeper, latent character states.

Method: Using CFSMs, which convert textual character profiles into finite-state machines, extended into CPFSMs to incorporate probabilistic state transitions.

Result: CFSMs and CPFSMs outperform traditional methods in both synthetic and real-world role-playing scenarios, providing structured and open-ended state exploration.

Conclusion: Codified state machines offer interpretable frameworks that enforce consistency and improve role-playing dynamics in large language models.

Abstract: Modeling latent character states is crucial for consistent and engaging role-playing (RP) with large language models (LLMs). Yet, existing prompting-based approaches mainly capture surface actions, often failing to track the latent states that drive interaction. We revisit finite-state machines (FSMs), long used in game design to model state transitions. While effective in small, well-specified state spaces, traditional hand-crafted, rule-based FSMs struggle to adapt to the open-ended semantic space of RP. To address this, we introduce Codified Finite-State Machines (CFSMs), a framework that automatically codifies textual character profiles into FSMs using LLM-based coding. CFSMs extract key states and transitions directly from the profile, producing interpretable structures that enforce character consistency. To further capture uncertainty and variability, we extend CFSMs into Codified Probabilistic Finite-State Machines (CPFSMs), where transitions are modeled as probability distributions over states. Through both synthetic evaluations and real-world RP scenarios in established artifacts, we demonstrate that CFSM and CPFSM outperform generally applied baselines, verifying effectiveness not only in structured tasks but also in open-ended stochastic state exploration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KV-CoRE, an SVD-based method to assess the compressibility of kv-caches used in large language models, addressing issues related to memory bandwidth saturation during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing demands on GPU memory bandwidth caused by reading and writing kv-caches during autoregressive decoding in large language models.

Method: An SVD-based gradient-free, incremental method called KV-CoRE is proposed to quantify the low-rank compressibility of kv-caches, along with a systematic evaluation framework using the Normalized Effective Rank metric.

Result: The authors analyzed multiple models and datasets across languages and domains, identifying systematic patterns linking compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage, while showing strong correlations with performance degradation under compression.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational insights and benchmarks for understanding kv-cache compressibility, paving the way for data-aware compression and improved model development.

Abstract: Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.

*Léo Labat,Etienne Ollion,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the behavior of multilingual large language models (LLMs) in answering value-laden multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across different languages. It focuses on consistency, human-translated survey data, and variations in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how multilingual LLMs address value-laden MCQs across languages and whether they display consistent reasoning or language-specific biases.

Method: The authors released a new human-translated corpus (MEVS) and tested over thirty multilingual LLMs with controlled prompt variations to evaluate response consistency and language-induced variations.

Result: Larger, instruction-tuned LLMs showed better consistency overall but with significant variations across individual MCQs. Language-specific behavior emerged for certain questions in instruction-fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: The study highlights inconsistent patterns in responses across languages and calls for further studies on preference fine-tuning's selective effects on multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models face difficulty in multilingual contexts, struggling to understand and generate responses in non-English languages effectively.

Method: The proposed TRIT framework integrates translation and reasoning training without relying on external feedback or additional multilingual datasets.

Result: TRIT improves accuracy in multilingual reasoning tasks by 7 percentage points and enhances cross-lingual question alignment (10 percentage points) and translation quality (up to 8.4 COMET points).

Conclusion: Integrating translation training into reasoning models significantly boosts multilingual understanding and performance in reasoning tasks across various languages.

Abstract: Long reasoning models often struggle in multilingual settings: they tend to reason in English for non-English questions; when constrained to reasoning in the question language, accuracies drop substantially. The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free scheduling method with a KV-cache mechanism to enhance text generation quality and inference efficiency in diffusion large language models (dLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the suboptimal performance of fixed, predefined block schedules in dLLMs, which fail to adapt dynamically to semantic difficulty, leading to inefficiencies and quality issues in text generation.

Method: The authors propose the Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method with a dynamically sized sliding block, and DSB Cache, a KV-cache mechanism optimized for DSB to enhance inference.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSB and DSB Cache consistently improve generation quality and efficiency across multiple models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic adaptation to semantic difficulty is crucial for high-quality, efficient text generation in dLLMs, and DSB with DSB Cache effectively addresses this challenge.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.

TL;DR: This study assesses the accuracy of LLMs in mental health evaluation using narrative data and PTSD scores, highlighting the influence of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand factors affecting accuracy of large language models when used for zero-shot mental health assessments.

Method: Evaluation of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing a clinical dataset, varying contextual inputs and modeling strategies systematically.

Result: LLMs perform best with detailed context; reasoning improves accuracy; model size impacts open vs closed weights differently; ensembling supervised models with zero-shot LLMs yields optimal performance.

Conclusion: Careful selection of context and modeling strategies enhances the accuracy of LLM-based mental health assessments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for accelerating language model inference require complicated processes, such as training additional models and creating complex pipelines, which complicate deployment.

Method: A simple online distillation method is used to convert a slow autoregressive model into a fast multi-token prediction model while retaining the same implementation as the initial pretrained model.

Result: The method achieves over 3x faster decoding speeds on GSM8K tasks with less than 5% drop in accuracy compared to single-token decoding.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical and efficient way to accelerate language model inference, without the need for auxiliary components or specialized infrastructure.

Abstract: Existing techniques for accelerating language model inference, such as speculative decoding, require training auxiliary speculator models and building and deploying complex inference pipelines. We consider a new approach for converting a pretrained autoregressive language model from a slow single next token prediction model into a fast standalone multi-token prediction model using a simple online distillation objective. The final model retains the exact same implementation as the pretrained initial checkpoint and is deployable without the addition of any auxiliary verifier or other specialized inference code. On GSM8K, our method produces models that can decode more than $3\times$ faster on average at $<5\%$ drop in accuracy relative to single token decoding performance.

TL;DR: BudgetMem introduces a runtime memory framework for large language models, enabling explicit control over performance-cost trade-offs with various budget tiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of LLM memory rely on offline and query-agnostic setups, which can discard crucial information and lack efficiency.

Method: BudgetMem uses a modular setup, offering three budget tiers and a lightweight router trained with reinforcement learning for balance between performance and cost.

Result: BudgetMem outperforms baselines in high-budget settings and achieves better accuracy-cost trade-offs under constrained budgets.

Conclusion: BudgetMem effectively clarifies memory processing strategies in runtime memory frameworks, optimizing tasks and costs across varying budget regimes.

Abstract: Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.

*Jian Chen,Yesheng Liang,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFlash is a speculative decoding framework that achieves efficient parallel drafting for language models using a block diffusion model, delivering significant speedups compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address performance limitations of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), which suffer from high latency and poor GPU utilization due to sequential decoding.

Method: The authors propose DFlash, a method that uses a lightweight block diffusion model, enabling parallel token generation by conditioning on context features extracted from the target model.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DFlash provides over 6x lossless acceleration and achieves up to 2.5x higher speedup compared to EAGLE-3, the current state-of-the-art speculative decoding method.

Conclusion: DFlash offers an effective solution to improve language model inference by combining parallelism and high-quality outputs, outperforming previous speculative decoding techniques in both speed and efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.

TL;DR: SIDeR is a framework for face privacy protection that separates identity features from visual appearance, ensuring privacy and restoring original images when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of facial recognition in sensitive applications like banking and identity verification necessitates effective methods to safeguard privacy during image storage and transmission.

Method: SIDeR separates a face image into a machine-recognizable identity vector and a semantic visual appearance component using a diffusion model. It employs adversarial samples, semantic-visual balancing, and momentum-driven perturbation optimization to anonymize faces while preserving functionality. Restoration is password-protected.

Result: SIDeR achieved a 99% success rate in adversarial attacks (black-box scenarios) and significantly improved restoration quality by 41.28% in PSNR compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SIDeR provides a robust solution for facial privacy by combining anonymity, security, and accessible restoration, surpassing existing methods in effectiveness and quality.

Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address deficiencies in current MOT systems by introducing a loss function that improves detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency seamlessly.

Method: UniTrack employs a differentiable graph representation learning technique to optimize holistic tracking objectives, making it easily integrable with various MOT systems without architectural changes.

Result: UniTrack yields notable improvements, including reduced identity switches by up to 53%, IDF1 improvements by 12%, and significant performance boosts (e.g., 9.7% MOTA improvement on SportsMOT).

Conclusion: UniTrack enhances multi-object tracking performance across diverse benchmarks and models, delivering better identity preservation and consistency without the need for system redesigns.

Abstract: We present UniTrack, a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function designed to significantly enhance multi-object tracking (MOT) performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning. Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.

*Yiye Chen,Yanan Jian,Xiaoyi Dong,Shuxin Cao,Jing Wu,Patricio Vela,Benjamin E. Lundell,Dongdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies a vision-action misalignment issue in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and proposes a training framework to enhance visual conditioning and improve model performance on robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unreliable action predictions in VLA models caused by weak dependence on current visual states, which affects the performance on robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: The method involves a two-step approach: 1) optimizing preferences in a surrogate visual-conditioning task to align actions with visual input and 2) transferring this alignment to instruction-following tasks via latent-space distillation during finetuning.

Result: The proposed framework improves visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA models and shows consistent gains in the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting without architectural modifications or additional data.

Conclusion: Strengthening visual dependence in VLA models is crucial, and the proposed method effectively enhances both visual alignment and task performance in robotic systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and simplify dietary assessment for health monitoring and chronic disease prevention by employing image-based methodologies.

Method: Analyzes various approaches like depth maps, multi-view inputs, template matching, and deep learning techniques to estimate food portion sizes.

Result: Highlights the effectiveness of auxiliary inputs and neural networks in improving portion estimations from images.

Conclusion: Combining traditional and AI-driven strategies can enhance the accuracy of dietary assessment through reliable portion estimation.

Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.

TL;DR: This paper develops a biological reservoir computing (BRC) system using in vitro cortical neurons to perform visual pattern recognition tasks with a neuromorphic computing approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage living neural circuits for computation in reservoir computing, as an alternative to artificial models, integrating biological principles into machine learning.

Method: A biological reservoir computing system uses in vitro cortical neurons interfaced with a high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA). Visual pattern recognition tasks are carried out by input stimulation through selected electrodes and readout via a linear classifier.

Result: Despite variability in biological neural responses, the system produces high-dimensional feature representations that enable accurate classification across various visual tasks, including MNIST digits.

Conclusion: The results indicate that living neural systems can effectively serve as computational reservoirs, advancing the integration of biological principles into machine learning and neuro-inspired computing frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains, particularly identifying potential shortcomings in visual decision-making for healthcare applications.

Method: The paper presents Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), a process to identify and validate key visual dependencies in multimodal models by generating hypotheses and applying manual interventions.

Result: VCR revealed unexpected gaps in the performance of LMMs when handling demographic subgroups across tasks like malignant skin lesion classification and other medical imaging challenges.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the utility of VCR in auditing multimodal models to uncover visual concept biases and improve understanding in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.

*Weiyi Qin,Yingci Liu-Swetz,Shiwei Tan,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces CLEAR-HPV to address interpretability challenges of attention-based MIL in predicting HPV status from histopathology slides by enabling the discovery and usage of biologically relevant concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention-based MIL models succeed in slide-level HPV predictions but lack interpretability regarding the morphological features driving the predictions, necessitating a more interpretable framework.

Method: The proposed CLEAR-HPV restructures the MIL latent space with attention mechanisms to automatically discover and represent morphological concepts like keratinizing and basaloid structures, without needing pre-labeled concepts.

Result: CLEAR-HPV maintains predictive performance while drastically reducing the dimensionality of representations from 1536 to 10 interpretable concepts and generalizes well across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HPV enables both compact and interpretable slide representations by distilling high-dimensional embeddings into biologically meaningful concepts, facilitating better understanding and transparency in HPV slide-level predictions.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARGaze, a transformer-based model for online egocentric gaze estimation that uses visual context and recent gaze history for accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of predicting gaze in egocentric video settings, where there are no explicit head or eye signals, and only indirect cues like interactions with objects or scene content are available.

Method: The method reformulates gaze estimation as a sequential prediction task using a transformer decoder. It predicts gaze by conditioning on current visual features and a fixed-length window of recent gaze target estimates.

Result: The proposed ARGaze model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with ablation studies confirming the importance of its autoregressive modeling and limited gaze history.

Conclusion: Reformulating gaze estimation as sequential prediction using ARGaze improves accuracy in egocentric settings, and the authors intend to release the code and pre-trained models to benefit the community.

Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents AirGlove, a framework enhancing vision-based hand tracking models for sensing gloves by addressing performance issues on new glove designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sensor-based tracking and existing vision-based models which struggle with gloved hand designs due to appearance differences.

Method: AirGlove optimizes vision-based tracking by leveraging representations of existing gloves to generalize pose models to new glove designs using limited data.

Result: Experiments reveal AirGlove's effectiveness, demonstrating improved hand pose estimation across multiple types of sensing gloves.

Conclusion: AirGlove successfully mitigates performance degradation in vision-based tracking for sensing gloves, enabling better generalization and higher accuracy with minimal data.

Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate social and demographic biases inherited by deep neural networks from imbalanced annotated data, as these biases lead to unfair predictions.

Method: The proposed two-stage method, SHaSaM, includes SHaSaM-MINE (a submodular subset selection for hard sample mining) and SHaSaM-LEARN (a combinatorial loss function family utilizing Submodular Conditional Mutual Information).

Result: Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show SHaSaM improves model fairness (Equalized Odds) by up to 2.7 points and Accuracy by 3.5%, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer epochs.

Conclusion: SHaSaM effectively balances fairness and performance in deep neural networks by mitigating the influence of sensitive attributes through a novel submodular-based approach.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

Motivation: To overcome vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks, addressing drawbacks like high computational costs in existing methods.

Method: ShapePuri utilizes a Shape Encoding Module for geometric guidance and a Global Appearance Debiasing module for mitigating appearance bias.

Result: ShapePuri achieves 84.06% clean accuracy and 81.64% robust accuracy on AutoAttack, surpassing existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: ShapePuri offers an efficient, scalable defense that aligns model robustness with stable structural invariants, preserving prediction stability without added computational cost.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.

TL;DR: PoseGaussian, a novel framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis, incorporates human body pose for depth and temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art results with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic human scene rendering, such as articulated motion and self-occlusion, and improve upon traditional methods that use pose signal only partially.

Method: PoseGaussian integrates pose as a structural and temporal cue into a fully differentiable, end-to-end pipeline. It leverages pose-guided Gaussian Splatting for enhanced depth estimation and temporal consistency.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and structural accuracy on datasets like ZJU-MoCap and THuman2.0, with metrics PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028. It also delivers real-time rendering at 100 FPS.

Conclusion: PoseGaussian effectively integrates pose into both the geometric and temporal aspects of human view synthesis, excelling in quality, efficiency, and robustness in dynamic human scenes.

Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods relying on Vision-Language Models struggle to effectively capture subtle temporal dynamics in video quality evaluation.

Method: The authors reformulate video generative models as energy-based models (EBMs) for reward modeling, utilizing synthetic negative videos with controlled degradations to encourage learning meaningful spatiotemporal features.

Result: The proposed model (modelname) outperformed state-of-the-art methods on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench with 6x to 65x fewer human annotations.

Conclusion: Generative video models can serve as temporally-aware, efficient reward models through repurposing and novel techniques like contrastive objectives and synthetic negative samples.

Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining explicit and implicit representations for neural compression at ultra-low bitrates, outperforming current methods in perceptual quality and semantic faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural codecs face significant limitations in ultra-low bitrate scenarios due to a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism.

Method: The proposed framework integrates explicit high-level semantics and reverse-channel coding for implicit fine-grained details without retraining. A plug-in encoder adjusts the distortion-perception tradeoff.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in rate-perception metrics, with significant improvements over DiffC on Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively addresses semantic distortion and perceptual quality challenges, offering significant advantages over prior methods in neural compression.

Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces E.M.Ground, a novel approach to improving Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) using advanced techniques for holistic event matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TVG faces challenges due to current methods' reliance on exact timestamps, which overlook semantic continuity of events, leading to ambiguities.

Method: E.M.Ground uses a specialized <event> token for holistic frame information, Savitzky-Golay smoothing for reducing noise in token-frame similarity, and multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance temporal understanding.

Result: E.M.Ground demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in benchmark datasets for TVG tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations in E.M.Ground effectively address the limitations of previous TVG methods, setting a new standard for event-based video grounding.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.

*Jiahao Nie,Guanqiao Fu,Wenbin An,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation by proposing Multi-view Progressive Adaptation (MPA) to improve adaptation to target domains, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face constrained performance due to limited and diverse target samples and weak few-shot capability in target domains. The substantial domain gaps further hinder adaptation to new categories.

Method: The proposed Multi-view Progressive Adaptation (MPA) includes two strategies: Hybrid Progressive Augmentation (data perspective) to create diverse and challenging learning scenarios, and Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction (strategy perspective) leveraging complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths.

Result: The MPA method demonstrates superior adaptation to target domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with a performance improvement of +7.0%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances few-shot segmentation in data-scarce target domains by progressively building robust adaptability and leveraging diverse augmentations and predictions.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors highlight challenges of current SAM-based approaches for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), especially in domains like medical or satellite imagery. They propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach to improve segmentation performance by sparsifying dense matched points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM-based point-matching methods for few-shot segmentation struggle with large domain shifts in CD-FSS tasks, disrupting the segmentation performance, especially in fields like medical or satellite imaging.

Method: The authors introduce Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), which uses reference exemplars and their ground-truth masks to guide the adaptive sparsification of dense matched points for improved SAM interactions in cross-domain segmentation.

Result: CPS demonstrates superior performance compared to existing SAM-based approaches in CD-FSS tasks across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Adjusting point density through CPS addresses the challenges posed by domain shifts in SAM-based few-shot segmentation, enhancing segmentation accuracy in cross-domain scenarios without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

Abstract: Automated detection of electron dense deposits (EDD) in glomerular disease is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. While crowdsourcing reduces annotation cost, it introduces label noise. We propose an active label cleaning method to efficiently denoise crowdsourced datasets. Our approach uses active learning to select the most valuable noisy samples for expert re-annotation, building high-accuracy cleaning models. A Label Selection Module leverages discrepancies between crowdsourced labels and model predictions for both sample selection and instance-level noise grading.

TL;DR: This paper proposes RFM-Pose, a novel framework for efficient category-level 6D object pose estimation that combines flow-matching generative models with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of score-based diffusion models in solving rotational symmetry ambiguities in category-level object pose estimation.

Method: The method integrates a flow-matching generative model for efficient pose sampling along optimal transport paths, and employs reinforcement learning (proximal policy optimization) to fine-tune the sampling policy for hypothesis scoring.

Result: The proposed RFM-Pose framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the REAL275 benchmark with significantly reduced computation costs and is adaptable to object pose tracking.

Conclusion: RFM-Pose is a computationally efficient and versatile approach for object pose estimation, outperforming existing methods while maintaining adaptability.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) by fine-tuning prototypes instead of adapting feature extractors, improving performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional FSCIL techniques, where frozen pre-trained feature extractors lead to static prototypes with inherent representation biases, and prompt-based tuning struggles with assimilating new information due to limited data.

Method: The paper introduces a prototype fine-tuning framework that optimizes decision regions by transforming static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. It employs a dual-calibration method with class-specific and task-aware offsets to improve discriminative power.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters, addressing the challenges of FSCIL effectively.

Conclusion: Freezing the feature extractor and focusing on prototype fine-tuning provides better optimization of decision regions for FSCIL, making it efficient and effective for incremental learning tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

TL;DR: Magic-MM-Embedding introduces efficient models for universal multimodal retrieval by reducing visual token processing costs while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost in universal multimodal retrieval caused by processing extensive visual tokens.

Method: Magic-MM-Embedding integrates visual token compression and a multi-stage progressive training approach combining pretraining, contrastive learning, hard negative mining, and task-aware fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in multimodal retrieval while significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage.

Conclusion: Magic-MM-Embedding balances efficiency and performance, offering advancements in multimodal embedding with substantial benefits in practical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

TL;DR: Fast-SAM3D optimizes and accelerates SAM3D's pipeline for 3D reconstruction through a novel training-free framework that enhances speed without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3D suffers from high inference latency, limiting its deployment for 3D reconstruction from complex scenes. Existing acceleration strategies fail due to the inherent heterogeneity of the pipeline.

Method: Fast-SAM3D employs three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: modality-aware step caching, joint spatiotemporal token carving, and spectral-aware token aggregation to dynamically optimize computation.

Result: Experiments show that Fast-SAM3D achieves up to 2.67× speedup with minimal fidelity loss in single-view 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new standard for efficient 3D generation, bridging the gap between speed and quality while facilitating deployment of SAM3D for complex scene reconstruction.

Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fast-SAM3D delivers up to \textbf{2.67$\times$} end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlashBlock, a mechanism to optimize attention computation for block diffusion, resulting in faster inference with minimal quality impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in block diffusion models by reducing computational overhead caused by repeatedly calculating attention over KV caches in long-context settings.

Method: FlashBlock provides a cached block-external attention mechanism by reusing stable attention outputs and reducing unnecessary computations, while remaining compatible with sparse attention for improved accuracy.

Result: FlashBlock achieves up to 1.44× higher token throughput and up to 1.6× reduction in attention computation time, maintaining generation quality in diffusion language models and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: FlashBlock successfully optimizes computational efficiency in block diffusion processes, demonstrating significant performance improvements without degrading output quality.

Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

TL;DR: Wid3R is a feed-forward neural network for distortion-aware 3D reconstruction from wide field-of-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods are limited to pinhole-camera perspective images and require calibration to handle fisheye or panoramic cameras.

Method: Uses spherical harmonics, a ray representation, and a novel camera model token for robust 3D reconstruction from wide field-of-view images.

Result: Improved performance over prior methods, with up to +77.33 improvement on Stanford2D3D dataset.

Conclusion: Wid3R effectively addresses the limitations of prior models and supports direct reconstruction in real-world wide field-of-view scenarios.

Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery. It demonstrates strong zero-shot robustness and consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to +77.33 on Stanford2D3D.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTPano, a multi-task panoramic foundation model to address challenges in panoramic scene understanding caused by geometric distortions and the scarcity of annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve panoramic scene understanding, which is critical for immersive applications but hinders progress due to lack of high-resolution annotations, severe geometric distortions, and underexplored task relationships.

Method: The proposed approach involves creating pseudo-labels by projecting panoramas into perspective patches and leveraging powerful perspective models to annotate them. It further introduces a Panoramic Dual BridgeNet to handle task interference and distortion while incorporating auxiliary tasks for better cross-task learning.

Result: MTPano outperforms existing models in multiple benchmarks, showcasing competitive results even against specialist panoramic foundation models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MTPano successfully addresses the challenges in multi-task panoramic understanding and sets a new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models that aligns unsafe concepts with semantically consistent safe alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept erasure methods fail to balance effective removal of undesirable content with structural and semantic preservation, highlighting a gap in achieving safe yet consistent text-to-image generations.

Method: The authors propose PAIR, which combines paired unsafe-safe multimodal data for semantic realignment, a guided semantic mapping objective (Paired Semantic Realignment), and Fisher-weighted Initialization for Adapters, improving semantic consistency and safety selectively.

Result: PAIR achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines by effectively erasing unsafe concepts while maintaining image structural integrity, semantic coherence, and overall quality.

Conclusion: PAIR provides a fine-grained, novel solution to concept erasure in diffusion models, ensuring effective removal of harmful content while preserving quality and consistency in generated images.

Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing prototype-based OOD detection methods, particularly the Static Homogeneity Assumption and Learning-Inference Disconnect.

Method: Proposes a Two-Stage Repair process incorporating Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM) and Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS), to improve feature manifolds for OOD detection.

Result: APEX achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance, validated by experiments on benchmarks like CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: APEX effectively addresses key flaws in prototype-based OOD detection methods and enhances their performance through adaptive and posterior-aware mechanisms.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the HIVE framework to improve reasoning in multimodal models by evolving reasoning in a latent space using hierarchical visual cues, avoiding inefficiencies of textual rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on inefficient, verbose, and prone-to-error reasoning processes (fast thinking), and need a more seamless integration of multimodal reasoning.

Method: The HIVE framework extends transformer blocks with internal loops for iterative reasoning grounded in hierarchical visual cues, enabling reasoning entirely in latent spaces without reliance on textual rationales.

Result: HIVE allows test-time scaling using vision knowledge and improves the model's understanding of complex scenes by integrating hierarchical visual information.

Conclusion: Grounding reasoning in latent spaces with hierarchical visual cues leads to more efficient, effective, and accurate multimodal reasoning compared to traditional textual chains of thought.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

*Ningkang Peng,Xiaoqian Peng,Yuhao Zhang,Qianfeng Yu,Feng Xing,Peirong Ma,Xichen Yang,Yi Chen,Tingyu Lu,Yanhui Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a Simplicity Paradox in OOD detection methods, revealing a sensitivity imbalance towards semantically simple yet structurally distinct samples. It introduces the D-KNN framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in current OOD detection methods, specifically their inability to effectively detect structurally distinct or noisy samples due to Semantic Hegemony in deep feature space.

Method: Proposes D-KNN, a geometric decoupling framework that uses orthogonal decomposition and dual-space calibration to separate semantic components from structural residuals.

Result: D-KNN breaks Semantic Hegemony, improving FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3% and sensor failure detection (AUROC) from 79.7% to 94.9%, achieving new SOTA performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: D-KNN successfully resolves issues in OOD detection and enhances sensitivity to structurally distinct samples, providing robust and computationally efficient improvements.

Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CityGenAgent proposes a framework for procedural generation of 3D cities driven by natural language, addressing challenges in asset realism, controllability, and manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in realism, controllability, and manipulation of 3D city generation, critical for applications like autonomous driving and virtual environments.

Method: CityGenAgent splits city generation into two programs (Block and Building) with Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to ensure semantic and structural integrity.

Result: The framework achieves superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability over existing methods for scalable 3D city generation.

Conclusion: CityGenAgent establishes a reliable framework for generating and editing high-quality 3D cities, enhancing applications in various domains like VR and autonomous systems.

Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.

### [167] [SAIL: Self-Amplified Iterative Learning for Diffusion Model Alignment with Minimal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05380)
*Xiaoxuan He,Siming Fu,Wanli Li,Zhiyuan Li,Dacheng Yin,Kang Rong,Fengyun Rao,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SAIL framework, enabling diffusion models to align with human preferences using minimal human feedback by leveraging their latent self-improvement capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning diffusion models with human preferences without the need for extensive human annotations or external reward models, which are costly and impractical.

Method: The SAIL framework uses a closed-loop, iterative process where diffusion models self-generate, self-annotate, and refine based on a minimal human-provided seed dataset, complemented by a ranked preference mixup strategy for balanced learning.

Result: SAIL achieves superior performance in aligning diffusion models using only 6% of the preference data compared to existing methods, demonstrating the self-improvement potential of these models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that diffusion models, with proper frameworks like SAIL, can minimize reliance on human annotators and external reward systems, advancing cost-effective and efficient alignment techniques.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.

*Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh,Jike Zhong,Konstantinos Psounis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VRIQ, a benchmark to assess visual reasoning abilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs), revealing major perception limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning and identify the weaknesses in their visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors created a benchmark called VRIQ, evaluating abstract puzzle-style tasks and natural-image reasoning tasks. Additionally, they introduced diagnostic probes to analyze perception and reasoning failures more precisely.

Result: VLMs demonstrated poor performance in visual reasoning tasks, with low accuracy (28% on abstract puzzles, 45% on natural-image reasoning) and modest improvements with tools. Most failures (56%) stem from perception limitations, and specific perception categories were identified as problematic.

Conclusion: Current VLMs are unreliable for abstract reasoning due to significant perception issues. The study offers diagnostic insights and a foundation for addressing these weaknesses to improve multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

*Hao Feng,Wei Shi,Ke Zhang,Xiang Fei,Lei Liao,Dingkang Yang,Yongkun Du,Xuecheng Wu,Jingqun Tang,Yang Liu,Hong Chen,Can Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dolphin-v2 is a two-stage document image parsing model that improves parsing performance, particularly for photographed and distorted documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document parsing models are highly fragmented, requiring complex model selection and being limited by scalability. Two-stage approaches fail to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively.

Method: Dolphin-v2 employs a two-stage approach: in stage one, it performs document type classification and layout analysis; in stage two, it utilizes a hybrid parsing strategy for both photographed and digital-born documents.

Result: Dolphin-v2 significantly improves parsing accuracy, achieving +14.78 points on OmniDocBench and reducing errors on photographed documents by 91%, with efficient inference enabled by parallel processing.

Conclusion: Dolphin-v2 outperforms its predecessor and other existing systems in handling various document types and offers scalability and robust parsing for distorted or photographed materials.

Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 3D architecture (Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer) for synthetic CT generation from MRI, addressing anatomical variability and nonlinear MRI-CT relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable MRI-only planning in radiotherapy by addressing challenges like the absence of electron density information in MRI and its nonlinear relationship with CT data.

Method: Proposes a 3D architecture combining convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches that capture local anatomical details and long-range context using multi-scale shifted window attention and hierarchical feature aggregation.

Result: Achieves higher image similarity, improved geometric accuracy, and clinically acceptable dosimetric performance with a mean target dose error of 1.69%.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches, providing a reliable solution for MRI-only radiotherapy planning. Code is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation. As a result, current radiotherapy workflows rely on combined MRI and CT acquisitions, increasing registration uncertainty and procedural complexity. Synthetic CT generation enables MRI only planning but remains challenging due to nonlinear MRI-CT relationships and anatomical variability. We propose Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer, a 3D architecture that integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical detail and long-range contextual dependencies. Multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation improves anatomical fidelity. Experiments on public and clinical datasets demonstrate higher image similarity and improved geometric accuracy compared with baseline methods. Dosimetric evaluation shows clinically acceptable performance, with a mean target dose error of 1.69%. Code is available at: https://github.com/mobaidoctor/med2transformer.

*Qianxin Xia,Jiawei Du,Yuhan Zhang,Jielei Wang,Guoming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Statistical Flow Matching, a novel method to efficiently distill datasets by using statistical flows, which significantly reduces computational and memory overhead while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory inefficiency in current dataset distillation methods, especially for classification tasks using pre-trained self-supervised models.

Method: The paper proposes Statistical Flow Matching, which aligns constant statistical flows instead of relying on computationally expensive gradient matching. It reduces computational needs by accessing raw statistics once and performing a single augmentation pass.

Result: The proposed approach achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing GPU memory usage by 10x and runtime by 4x.

Conclusion: This method is a stable, efficient framework for dataset distillation, significantly reducing resource requirements and enabling performance gains. The classifier inheritance strategy further enhances performance with minimal additional overhead.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for biologically plausible editing of cell nuclei features in digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathomics features enhance reproducibility and explainability in digital pathology but face interpretation challenges, especially due to correlations between features.

Method: The authors propose a MAD framework that combines a VAE-learned disentangled latent space and a conditional diffusion model to edit pathomics features while maintaining biological validity.

Result: The MAD framework effectively edits target features while adjusting correlated ones, demonstrating improved coherence and fidelity compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: MAD facilitates controllable and realistic editing of correlated pathomics features, enhancing explainability and practicality in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.

Motivation: Existing traffic datasets mostly cover mild weather conditions, neglecting the challenges posed by extreme weather, which impacts traffic surveillance and accident rates.

Method: The study compiles a dataset with 32+ hours of real-world traffic data, over 48,000 manually annotated frames, and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames. The dataset includes various traffic participants and scenarios for benchmarking object detection.

Result: A benchmark is established to evaluate vehicle detection under adverse weather and occlusion conditions, exposing existing challenges and areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The TSBOW dataset is a valuable tool for Intelligent Transportation Systems research, offering insights into improving automated traffic monitoring in diverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Global warming has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which degrade CCTV signal and video quality while disrupting traffic flow, thereby increasing traffic accident rates. Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our findings underscore the potential of CCTV-based traffic monitoring, pave the way for new research and applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Memory-Execute-Review (MER) framework to address both success rate and generalization challenges in Visual Language Navigation. MER achieves significant improvements across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle to balance high success rates and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to address this challenge by proposing a novel framework.

Method: The proposed Memory-Execute-Review framework comprises: 1) hierarchical memory for support, 2) execute module for routine decision-making, and 3) review module for corrective actions.

Result: The framework delivered absolute improvements in success rates across multiple datasets (average SR improvement of 7% under TF and 5% under ZS settings), outperforming existing approaches in both success rate and generalization.

Conclusion: This framework effectively balances success rate and generalization, achieving leadership across datasets while providing a novel approach to VLN tasks.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to address OOD detection challenges in long-tailed distributions without relying on external datasets, using statistical modeling and a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of samples in tail classes in long-tailed distributions blurs decision boundaries, while current methods depend on external data that are often costly and sensitive.

Method: The proposed Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher distribution to perform directional sampling of outliers, combined with a Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) for improved feature distinction.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like CIFAR-LT show that the approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods using external datasets.

Conclusion: The method eliminates the need for external datasets while achieving superior OOD detection performance in long-tailed distributions.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.

Result: The dataset provides over 4.6k images and 6k poses (classic set), with extended modalities for advanced approaches, and evaluation of state-of-the-art methods reveals room for improvement in instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation.

Conclusion: IndustryShapes sets a new standard for testing methods in industrial robotics by presenting a realistic, application-based dataset. It highlights challenges and opportunities for advancing 6D pose estimation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce IndustryShapes, a new RGB-D benchmark dataset of industrial tools and components, designed for both instance-level and novel object 6D pose estimation approaches. The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain.

TL;DR: The study introduces a cell instance segmentation method that excels in addressing challenges in dense and complex cellular regions. It analyzes real-world cell graphs to understand chromatic properties and proposes a novel framework "Disco" for effective segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing cell segmentation methods, particularly their struggles with dense and complex cellular arrangements in pathology datasets.

Method: The proposed framework (Disco) employs an adjacency-aware strategy combining "Explicit Marking" to transform challenges into classification tasks and "Implicit Disambiguation" to resolve ambiguities and enforce feature distinctions.

Result: A large dataset, GBC-FS 2025, with dense nuclear arrangements is introduced, and the method proves effective in resolving adjacency issues, demonstrating success in analyzing cell adjacency graphs.

Conclusion: Disco validates a new segmentation paradigm using adjacency-aware collaborative coloring, successfully improving segmentation in dense and complex pathological tissue regions.

Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.

TL;DR: PIRATR is a 3D object detection method for robotic applications in point clouds, jointly estimating object pose and task-specific attributes, validated effectively on synthetic training and real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robotic 3D object detection by integrating geometric localization and actionable task-relevant attributes to accommodate robotic use cases more effectively.

Method: PIRATR extends PI3DETR using modular class-specific heads that estimate both 6-DoF poses and parametric attributes from occluded point cloud data. It uses synthetic training and validates on an automated forklift platform.

Result: PIRATR achieves a detection mAP of 0.919 on real outdoor LiDAR scans without requiring fine-tuning, demonstrating generalization from synthetic to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: PIRATR enables robust, scalable robotic perception by combining pose and parametric attribute estimation, bridging geometric reasoning and actionable world models.

Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

### [179] [NeVStereo: A NeRF-Driven NVS-Stereo Architecture for High-Fidelity 3D Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05423)
*Pengcheng Chen,Yue Hu,Wenhao Li,Nicole M Gunderson,Andrew Feng,Zhenglong Sun,Peter Beerel,Eric J Seibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents NeVStereo, an architecture that combines neural rendering and stereo techniques for unified camera pose refinement, depth estimation, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction systems lack a unified framework tackling camera pose accuracy, geometry precision, high-fidelity rendering, and surface reconstruction simultaneously.

Method: The methodology includes NeRF-based rendering for stereo-friendly visualizations, confidence-driven depth estimation, bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and iterative updates of depth and radiance field ensuring geometric consistency.

Result: NeVStereo outperformed other methods in benchmarks with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher rendering fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality metrics.

Conclusion: NeVStereo successfully integrates NeRF with stereo methods, resolving key issues in traditional 3D reconstruction and neural rendering techniques, providing robust results across diverse datasets.

Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.

### [180] [Sparse Video Generation Propels Real-World Beyond-the-View Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05827)
*Hai Zhang,Siqi Liang,Li Chen,Yuxian Li,Yukuan Xu,Yichao Zhong,Fu Zhang,Hongyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SparseVideoNav, a model designed for Beyond-the-View Navigation, enabling efficient navigation in unknown environments guided by high-level intents instead of detailed instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable agents to navigate the real-world autonomously using high-level intents, addressing the limitation of current methods which rely on dense step-by-step instructions and often fail over long horizons.

Method: The proposed method leverages video generation models, which are inherently suited to long-horizon tasks, and introduces SparseVideoNav to make trajectory inference scalable and efficient. This model generates a sparse future for navigation guidance, achieving sub-second speed in processing.

Result: SparseVideoNav delivers a 27x speed-up compared to unoptimized video generation methods, with a 2.5x success rate improvement over state-of-the-art LLM baselines in navigating challenging environments, including night scenes.

Conclusion: SparseVideoNav demonstrates the feasibility of using video generation for BVN tasks by effectively balancing long-horizon capabilities with real-world efficiency, achieving significant success in demanding scenarios.

Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

*Wahyu Rahmaniar,Kenji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-AD, a CNN model combining squeeze-and-excitation blocks, knowledge distillation, and a discriminator network for unsupervised anomaly detection, achieves high accuracy across medical and industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of annotated data in cross-domain anomaly detection, vital for fields like early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry.

Method: The proposed Multi-AD model includes SE blocks for channel-wise attention, knowledge distillation for better feature learning, a discriminator network for improved anomaly differentiation, and multi-scale feature integration during inference.

Result: Experiments show Multi-AD achieved top results on medical and industrial datasets, with strong generalization and high AUROC scores: image-level (81.4% medical, 99.6% industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% medical, 98.4% industrial).

Conclusion: Multi-AD effectively advances unsupervised anomaly detection, outperforming existing models, and is highly generalizable across multiple domains for real-world applications.

Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.

*Sanghoon Jeon,Gihyun Jung,Suhyeon Ka,Jae-Sang Hyun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LD-SLRO, a latent diffusion-based method for improving fringe projection profilometry on reflective surfaces, achieving enhanced fringe quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise in fringe projection profilometry for reflective and smooth surfaces due to specular reflection and indirect illumination distorting measurement accuracy.

Method: The LD-SLRO approach encodes phase-shifted fringe images to extract latent features, which are processed through a latent diffusion model to eliminate artifacts and restore fringe patterns. It uses novel components like specular reflection encoder and attention modules for improved restoration.

Result: The method significantly enhances fringe image quality and reduces 3D reconstruction error compared to existing techniques, achieving an average error reduction from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

Conclusion: LD-SLRO effectively overcomes limitations in profiling reflective surfaces, offering improved measurement precision and flexibility.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

### [183] [Stable Velocity: A Variance Perspective on Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05435)
*Donglin Yang,Yongxing Zhang,Xin Yu,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Xiaojuan Qi,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow matching's reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance targets, hindering optimization. Stable Velocity framework introduces methods for reducing variance in training and accelerating sampling, yielding better training efficiency and faster sampling without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the optimization challenges and slow convergence caused by high-variance training targets in flow-matching methods.

Method: The authors propose Stable Velocity, a framework comprising StableVM for variance reduction, VA-REPA for adaptive supervision in low-variance regimes, and StableVS for accelerated sampling.

Result: Experiments show improved training efficiency on large-scale models and over $2×$ faster sampling within low-variance regimes without degrading output quality.

Conclusion: Stable Velocity demonstrates consistent performance enhancements, combining efficient training and faster sampling by addressing variance-related challenges in flow-matching methods.

Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic data generation using digital twins and parametric modeling enhances automated defect detection in industry via machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate defect detection is necessary for quality control in industries while maintaining the object's functionality during inspection.

Method: Parametric modeling is used to create synthetic 3D mesh objects with defects for data generation, combined with Monte Carlo simulations for inspection modeling.

Result: Synthetic data sets, including rare defects with pixel-perfect annotations, can be generated for machine learning applications.

Conclusion: This approach to synthetic data generation supports advancements in automated defect detection across various NDT methods.

Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.

### [185] [InterPrior: Scaling Generative Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06035)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans choreograph interactions through high-level intentions rather than explicit full-body motion. This paper introduces InterPrior, a scalable framework for humanoid coordination that learns from large-scale imitation and reinforcement learning to generalize locomotion and manipulation in diverse contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance humanoid robots' ability to perform complex loco-manipulation tasks by leveraging human-like high-level intentions and a scalable learning mechanism to generalize across diverse physical settings.

Method: InterPrior trains a goal-conditioned variational policy through imitation learning, distilling expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes using reinforcement learning combined with data augmentation using physical perturbations.

Result: The InterPrior framework produces a motion prior that generalizes well to unseen tasks, such as interacting with unseen objects, and demonstrates effectiveness in user-interactive control and the potential for deployment on real robotic systems.

Conclusion: Through scalable learning processes, InterPrior succeeds in delivering a generative control framework that enables humanoid robots to achieve generalizable whole-body coordination, suggesting its readiness and practicality for complex real-world interactions.

Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

*Chang Zou,Changlin Li,Yang Li,Patrol Li,Jianbing Wu,Xiao He,Songtao Liu,Zhao Zhong,Kailin Huang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel learnable feature caching mechanism for diffusion models to enable faster video generation without significant quality loss, achieving $11.8\times$ acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accelerating video generation face challenges such as semantic/detail loss due to excessive compression (in Feature Caching) and quality degradation during step-distillation. Combining these methods worsens the problem due to sparse sampling.

Method: The paper replaces traditional training-free heuristics with a lightweight learnable neural predictor for feature caching. It also introduces a Restricted MeanFlow approach to stabilize distillation on large-scale video models.

Result: The proposed methods achieve up to $11.8\times$ acceleration in video generation while minimizing degradation in generation quality, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Learnable feature caching and Restricted MeanFlow offer a promising path for faster, high-quality video generation in diffusion models, pushing acceleration boundaries significantly while preserving output quality.

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.

*Yue Lu,Xiangyu Zhou,Shizhou Zhang,Yinghui Xing,Guoqiang Liang,Wencong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) of Vision Transformers by proposing a framework to retain attention on previously learned visual concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformers in continual learning face catastrophic forgetting due to attention drift, which disrupts learned visual concepts.

Method: The proposed method employs attention-retaining mechanisms: extracting attention maps of previous tasks, generating binary masks, and applying them to modify gradients during backpropagation to mitigate forgetting.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserves visual concepts effectively, demonstrating robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

Conclusion: By creatively applying attention-specific gradient modifications, the paper provides a significant advancement in overcoming catastrophic forgetting in Vision Transformers, enhancing their efficacy in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOMA-1M, a global multimodal dataset enabling improved multi-scale foundation models and remote sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery lack multi-scale resolutions, sufficient scope, and high alignment accuracy, limiting advancements in multimodal remote sensing.

Method: The authors developed SOMA-1M, a dataset with over 1.3 million globally aligned image pairs from various sources, leveraging a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework for precise pixel-level alignment.

Result: Experiments show supervised training on SOMA-1M improves performance across hierarchical vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in multimodal remote sensing image matching.

Conclusion: SOMA-1M is a critical resource for advanced multimodal algorithms and robust foundation model training in remote sensing, fostering collaboration between SAR and optical modalities.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This scientific report introduces a dataset named PFSeq, aiming to find the best feature detector and descriptor for fisheye images in self-calibration contexts. The work was conducted during a PhD thesis in 2014, focusing on 3D modeling and localization with fisheye video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurate feature detection and description for fisheye images used in urban environment 3D modeling and localization, particularly for applications involving self-calibration.

Method: The report provides a detailed bibliography, introduces the PFSeq dataset, and conducts comprehensive experiments to evaluate feature detectors and descriptors for fisheye images, given the specific conditions of self-calibration with cameras mounted on moving vehicles.

Result: The findings highlight the challenges in achieving effective fisheye image feature detection and description without an accurate projection model, which is essential for subsequent self-calibration and 3D modeling workflows.

Conclusion: Although the report does not propose new algorithms or compare fisheye-specific methods, it establishes foundational results and provides a valuable dataset (PFSeq) for addressing related challenges in future work. The report remains dated to 2014's state-of-the-art developments.

Abstract: What is this report: This is a scientific report, contributing with a detailed bibliography, a dataset which we will call now PFSeq for ''Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence'' and make available at https://doi.org/10. 57745/DYIVVU, and comprehensive experiments. This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed. Discussions have been translated and enhanced but the experiments have not been run again and the report has not been updated accordingly to the evolution of the state-of-the-art (read this as a 2014 report).

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system tackling scale drift and inefficiency in long-range monocular SLAM with innovative motion-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle scale drift and inefficiency in long sequences of monocular SLAM, where conventional methods struggle with contextual coherence and computational cost.

Method: The method employs motion-aware submap construction using optical flow, anchor-driven dense Sim(3) alignment for efficient registration and loop closure, and lightweight pose graph optimization for global consistency.

Result: VGGT-Motion improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-range, zero-shot calibration-free monocular SLAM.

Conclusion: VGGT-Motion offers an efficient and robust global consistency solution for monocular SLAM, addressing limitations in scale drift and computational expenses while improving long-range performance.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.

*Jeongbin You,Donggun Kim,Sejun Park,Seungsang Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Mapper-GIN, a lightweight model for robust 3D point cloud classification using region-based graph abstraction rather than scaling architectures or extra augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if structural abstractions, rather than complex networks or augmentation methods, can improve robustness in 3D point cloud classification.

Method: The use of Mapper algorithm for region partitioning of point cloud data, constructing a region graph from overlaps, followed by graph classification using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN).

Result: Mapper-GIN achieves competitive accuracy on the ModelNet40-C benchmark with robustness under Noise and Transformation corruptions using a lightweight architecture (0.5M parameters).

Conclusion: Region-graph structural abstraction is an efficient, interpretable, and robust approach for 3D visual recognition.

Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

### [192] [Generalization of Self-Supervised Vision Transformers for Protein Localization Across Microscopy Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05527)
*Ben Isselmann,Dilara Göksu,Andreas Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The research explores how self-supervised learning (SSL) with DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers can transfer across microscopy datasets, achieving strong performance even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small microscopy datasets struggle to robustly train deep learning models. The authors aim to see if SSL pretrained on large unlabeled datasets can fill this gap across different microscopy domains.

Method: The study uses three DINO-pretrained Vision Transformer backbones on domain-specific datasets like ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell. A supervised classification head is trained for evaluations on the OpenCell dataset.

Result: All pretrained models showed strong performance, with the HPA-pretrained model slightly outperforming others (macro F1-score of 0.8221).

Conclusion: SSL domain-relevant representations generalize effectively across distinct, but related microscopy datasets, enabling excellent performance even with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.

*Youngwoo Shin,Jiwan Hur,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), an inference-time technique that enhances image generation fidelity and diversity in Visual Autoregressive models by focusing on high-frequency signals while maintaining global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the discrepancy in Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models' coarse-to-fine image generation, where limited capacity and accumulated errors hinder their hierarchy during inference.

Method: The authors introduce Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), which applies targeted inference-time guidance to emphasize high-frequency, semantic residuals. They use a frequency-based procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), to obtain sharper hierarchical information for guiding generation efficiently.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that SSG improves image generation fidelity and diversity with minimal latency impact, ensuring models maintain the desired hierarchy during inference.

Conclusion: Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG) resolves train-inference discrepancies in VAR models, offering an effective and training-free improvement to hierarchical image generation. This highlights the potential for better accuracy and higher diversity in coarse-to-fine synthesis.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion methods, finding that fusion models perform best but have room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance by improving 3D person detection capabilities in diverse environments beyond autonomous driving.

Method: A systematic analysis of three models (BEVDepth, PointPillars, DAL) using the JRDB dataset while studying performance under occlusion, distance variations, and sensor issues.

Result: Fusion models like DAL showed superior performance but were sensitive to sensor misalignments and certain corruptions. Camera-only models struggled the most under occlusions and disturbances.

Conclusion: Sensor fusion approaches are key for enhanced 3D person detection, though challenges like sensor robustness need further research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FastVMT, an efficient method for video motion transfer, improving runtime by addressing motion and gradient redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video motion transfer methods using the Diffusion Transformer face inefficiencies due to computational redundancies.

Method: FastVMT utilizes a masked attention mechanism to address motion redundancy and an optimization scheme to reuse gradients, reducing computational requirements.

Result: FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal video consistency.

Conclusion: By mitigating structural inefficiencies, FastVMT represents a significant advancement in fast and high-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

*Zhenxiao Liang,Ning Zhang,Youbao Tang,Ruei-Sung Lin,Qixing Huang,Peng Chang,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeGaussian introduces a high-fidelity, template-free approach to 4D human reconstruction using monocular videos, outperforming template-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like 4DGS struggle with high-deformation human motion and require multi-view cues, while template-based methods relying on SMPL are prone to artifacts from pose estimation errors.

Method: ShapeGaussian uses a two-step pipeline: coarse deformable geometry is learned from data-driven priors, followed by refining this geometry using a neural deformation model for detailed dynamics.

Result: ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based approaches in reconstruction accuracy, visual quality, and robustness, effectively resolving pose estimation and 2D keypoint visibility issues.

Conclusion: ShapeGaussian achieves high-fidelity 4D human reconstructions from casual monocular videos, avoiding artifacts and improving dynamic detail capture and robustness.

Abstract: We introduce ShapeGaussian, a high-fidelity, template-free method for 4D human reconstruction from casual monocular videos. Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction. Then, we refine this geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. By leveraging 2D vision priors, we mitigate artifacts from erroneous pose estimation in template-based methods and employ multiple reference frames to resolve the invisibility issue of 2D keypoints in a template-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior visual quality and robustness across diverse human motions in casual monocular videos.

TL;DR: ViGT is a geometric model for autonomous driving that estimates 3D occupancy fields from surround-view cameras without calibration or manual annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a scalable, simple, and generalizable geometric model for autonomous driving that can adapt to diverse sensor configurations without requiring costly manual annotations.

Method: ViGT utilizes a calibration-free architecture and self-supervised training using synchronized image-LiDAR pairs to infer 3D geometry in a unified coordinate frame.

Result: ViGT demonstrates scalability across five autonomous driving datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in pointmap estimation and comparable results with supervised methods on Occ3D-nuScenes.

Conclusion: ViGT is a promising step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, offering adaptability across sensor setups and eliminating the reliance on manual labeling while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework using CNNs and ML techniques to differentiate between atypical Parkinsonian disorders (APD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as among APD subtypes, leveraging various imaging inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of early differential diagnosis of APD subtypes, which are often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease due to overlapping symptoms.

Method: The proposed method combines CNN and ML techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD. It uses a multimodal input approach integrating T1-weighted MRI images, segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures, and corresponding volumetric measurements.

Result: The hybrid model achieved high classification performance, with AUC scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA, demonstrating effective subtype differentiation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs enhances classification accuracy for APD subtypes, showing potential for early diagnosis and better clinical interventions.

Abstract: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LocateEdit-Bench, a dataset and benchmark designed for instruction-driven image editing localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization methods struggle with the latest instruction-driven image editing, necessitating tools to address this gap.

Method: Developing a dataset (LocateEdit-Bench) with 231K edited images, integrating models, and defining multi-metric evaluation protocols.

Result: LocateEdit-Bench provides a comprehensive dataset with analyses and evaluation methods to benchmark forgery localization techniques.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for improving localization methods amidst advancements in semantically-aware visual manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have enabled highly controllable and semantically-aware alteration of visual content, posing unprecedented challenges to manipulation localization. However, existing AI-generated forgery localization methods primarily focus on inpainting-based manipulations, making them ineffective against the latest instruction-based editing paradigms. To bridge this critical gap, we propose LocateEdit-Bench, a large-scale dataset comprising $231$K edited images, designed specifically to benchmark localization methods against instruction-driven image editing. Our dataset incorporates four cutting-edge editing models and covers three common edit types. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset and develop two multi-metric evaluation protocols to assess existing localization methods. Our work establishes a foundation to keep pace with the evolving landscape of image editing, thereby facilitating the development of effective methods for future forgery localization. Dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

*Junyang Chen,Xiangbo Lv,Zhiqiang Kou,Xingdong Sheng,Ning Xu,Yiguo Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoGoSeg improves open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) by tackling spatial alignment and object priors issues. It achieves strong performance without extra resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSS methods struggle with spatial misalignment and lack robust object and region constraints, affecting detection accuracy and performance.

Method: LoGoSeg introduces an object existence prior, a region-aware alignment module, and a dual-stream fusion mechanism focusing on efficient segmentation without needing external resources.

Result: LoGoSeg performs competitively and generalizes well across six benchmarks for OVSS, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: LoGoSeg addresses key challenges in OVSS, offering a streamlined and effective approach for accurate pixel-wise segmentation in open-vocabulary tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

### [201] [Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05582)
*Joe-Mei Feng,Sheng-Wei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Geometric Observability Index (GOI) for quantifying per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on SE(3), using influence function theory and a novel approach based on the curvature operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical sensitivity tools fail to explain the individual influence of image features and the effects of inconsistent observations on modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems.

Method: The authors extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for SE(3) M-estimators. They propose GOI, which uses geometric properties (curvature, Lie algebra) to quantify measurement sensitivity.

Result: GOI reveals a spectrum-based decomposition that explains weak observability phenomena (e.g., pure rotation, vanishing parallax). It links with Fisher information bounds and serves as a diagnostic tool to identify dynamic features without altering existing pipelines.

Conclusion: GOI bridges conditioning analysis, Fisher information, influence function theory, and scene detectability within SLAM systems, providing a unified geometrically consistent framework to evaluate and diagnose measurement influence.

Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

TL;DR: The study introduces a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training, offering tactile feedback and independent practice without continuous supervision, outperforming virtual reality (VR)-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical students face limited opportunities for practical childbirth training due to clinical constraints, patient reluctance, and unpredictability of labor.

Method: Researchers developed a mixed reality system using spatially calibrated RGB-D cameras and HMDs to combine virtual guidance with hands-on manikin interaction, enabling accurate virtual overlays for independent practice.

Result: The MR system achieved stable, accurate localization, and a user study showed medical students preferred MR training, which led to better delivery performance compared to VR training.

Conclusion: Mixed reality provides a significant advantage over virtual reality for childbirth training by combining authentic haptic feedback with enhanced learning efficiency and independent practice.

Abstract: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve egocentric full-body pose tracking in VR systems, addressing limitations like instability, lower-body inaccuracies, and non-real-time performance.

Method: Utilizes a dual-modality fusion pipeline, spatiotemporal encoding, cross-attention for fusing motion cues, and kinematic optimization for stable and accurate pose estimation.

Result: EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art pose estimation models and is validated through a designed large-scale dataset and user study.

Conclusion: EgoPoseVR provides a robust solution for accurate VR embodiment without needing additional sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the static channel-wise mixing limitation in Vision Transformers and enhance adaptability to varying input content.

Method: CAViT employs a dual-attention architecture with spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention for dynamic, content-aware token mixing.

Result: CAViT outperforms standard Vision Transformers by up to +3.6% accuracy across benchmarks, while reducing parameters and FLOPs by over 30%.

Conclusion: CAViT improves representational expressiveness and efficiency with its unified token mixing strategy, supported by sharper and semantically meaningful attention maps.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data, using a new estimator and a meta-heuristic optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods primarily address classical models and single-instance reconstruction, leaving a gap in handling multiple instances of non-classical, complex models.

Method: The authors propose a novel estimator based on model-to-data error, which works without predefined error thresholds, and use a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for non-differentiable problems.

Result: The proposed method effectively reconstructs multi-instance non-classical models, as shown through experiments on various datasets.

Conclusion: Their technique offers a robust solution for multi-instance reconstruction of non-classical models, achieving accurate results without predefined thresholds.

Abstract: Most existing robust fitting methods are designed for classical models, such as lines, circles, and planes. In contrast, fewer methods have been developed to robustly handle non-classical models, such as spiral curves, procedural character models, and free-form surfaces. Furthermore, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model. This paper aims to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data. We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting.

Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

TL;DR: The paper presents ROMAN, a novel scenario generation method for testing Automated Driving Systems (ADS) focusing on high-risk traffic law violations and effective evaluation compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing ADS faces limitations in generating diverse, high-risk law-breaking scenarios and handling complex multi-vehicle interactions. Ensuring compliance with traffic laws and thorough safety testing is critical for deployment.

Method: ROMAN integrates a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. It uses an LLM-based risk evaluation for violations involving dimensions of severity and occurrence.

Result: ROMAN outperformed tools like ABLE and LawBreaker in generating more and diverse violation scenarios, achieving higher average violation count and addressing all traffic laws effectively in the CARLA simulation platform.

Conclusion: ROMAN provides a more effective solution to ADS testing by enabling comprehensive, diverse, and targeted evaluation of high-risk traffic law violations.

Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSurg is a new surgical video model utilizing latent motion prediction instead of pixel-level reconstruction for better semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical video analysis models focus on pixel-level details, which divert attention from essential semantic structures.

Method: UniSurg employs motion-guided latent prediction, spatiotemporal self-distillation, and feature diversity regularization, trained on a vast dataset (UniSurg-15M).

Result: UniSurg surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in surgical workflow and action recognition, skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: UniSurg redefines surgical video analysis by prioritizing semantic motion understanding over visual reconstruction.

Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances personality recognition by exploring granular hierarchical levels (facets and nuances) of the Big-Five Personality Model using audiovisual interaction data. Nuance-level models achieved better prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generalizing personality recognition models, which arises due to reliance on broad trait scores and limited training data. It explores the predictive power of finer hierarchical levels of personality traits.

Method: A transformer-based model with cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms was developed and trained using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset.

Result: Nuance-level models consistently outperformed facets and trait-level models, achieving up to 74% reduction in mean squared error across various interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: Granular personality levels, particularly nuances, improve generalization and accuracy in personality recognition models compared to broader traits or facets.

Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

*Inbar Gat,Dana Cohen-Bar,Guy Levy,Elad Richardson,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeUP is a 3D editing framework that uses image-conditioned latent translation to achieve scalable and precise 3D content creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of precise 3D manipulation, which often suffers from trade-offs in visual control, geometric consistency, and scalability in existing frameworks.

Method: ShapeUP introduces a supervised latent-to-latent translation method leveraging a pretrained 3D foundation model. It uses triplets (source 3D shape, edited 2D image, and edited 3D shape) to train a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT).

Result: ShapeUP provides fine-grained control for 3D edits while maintaining structural consistency, outperforming existing methods in identity preservation and edit fidelity.

Conclusion: ShapeUP sets a new robust and scalable paradigm for 3D manipulation, achieving superior visual control and structural fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

*Shadi Attarha,Kanaga Shanmugi,Anna Förster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents two methods for detecting tampered images in smart camera systems: a rule-based approach and a deep-learning approach, emphasizing their performance, computational demands, and required training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting camera tampering in outdoor smart cameras, which is crucial for maintaining surveillance and security systems.

Method: It proposes two tampering detection methods: a rule-based technique and a deep-learning approach, and evaluates their performance in real-world scenarios using provided datasets.

Result: The deep-learning method achieves higher accuracy, while the rule-based technique is better suited for resource-limited scenarios without extensive calibration.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the choice between the two methods depends on resource availability and calibration constraints, and contributes open-source datasets to advance research in camera tampering detection.

Abstract: Recently, the use of smart cameras in outdoor settings has grown to improve surveillance and security. Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.

### [212] [Exploring the Temporal Consistency for Point-Level Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05718)
*Yunchuan Ma,Laiyun Qing,Guorong Li,Yuqing Liu,Yuankai Qi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a frame-annotated method for temporal action localization using a model enhanced by self-supervised temporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack effective modeling of temporal frame relationships, which is essential for robust action localization.

Method: A multi-task learning framework is proposed utilizing point supervision integrated with three self-supervised tasks: Action Completion, Action Order Understanding, and Action Regularity Understanding.

Result: The method exhibits superior performance on four benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling temporal consistency in point supervision substantially improves action localization effectiveness.

Abstract: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

*Lexiang Hu,Youze Xue,Dian Li,Gang Liu,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed AGFF-Embed enhances multimodal embeddings by adaptively fusing global and fine-grained information for improved vision-language tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global semantic information limitations in multimodal embeddings hinder understanding of complex scenarios combining global and fine-grained perceptual patterns.

Method: Developed AGFF-Embed, generating multiple embeddings focusing on varied semantic dimensions, adaptively aggregated, complemented with Explicit Gradient Amplification for hard negatives enhancement.

Result: AGFF-Embed achieved state-of-the-art performance comprehensively in general and fine-grained understanding tested on MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: AGFF-Embed effectively fuses global and fine-grained perceptual patterns within MLLM embeddings, advancing multimodal alignment and understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.

### [214] [Depth as Prior Knowledge for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05730)
*Moussa Kassem Sbeyti,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study tackles challenges in detecting small and distant objects by introducing DepthPrior, a framework leveraging depth information during training and inference without altering detectors’ architectures. Results show significant improvements in detecting small-scale objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting small and distant objects reliably is crucial for safety-critical applications but is hindered by scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Current solutions using depth information involve complex changes to detector architectures, which the authors aim to eliminate.

Method: The authors propose DepthPrior, incorporating Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW), Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) at inference. Instead of fusing depth into the model, they use it as prior knowledge, simplifying the process.

Result: DepthPrior achieves up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects detected across benchmarks and detectors without architectural modifications, with impressive inference recovery rates (95:1 true-to-false detections).

Conclusion: DepthPrior simplifies leveraging depth information by acting as prior knowledge without requiring architectural modifications, showcasing effectiveness and efficiency in detecting small or distant objects across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

*Ti Wang,Xiaohang Yu,Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FMPose3D, a new framework for monocular 3D pose estimation leveraging Flow Matching (FM) for efficient sampling and achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally challenging due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, necessitating probabilistic methods for generating multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses.

Method: The authors propose a novel generative framework, FMPose3D, which uses Flow Matching (FM) with an ODE-based velocity field to continuously transport samples from a Gaussian prior to plausible 3D poses based on 2D inputs. It also introduces a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module to derive accurate single predictions.

Result: FMPose3D achieves superior performance on benchmarks such as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, Animal3D, and CtrlAni3D, outperforming existing methods for both human and animal pose estimation.

Conclusion: FMPose3D demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of combining Flow Matching and an RPEA module for probabilistic 3D pose estimation, setting new standards on various datasets and showcasing significant advancements in the field.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReText introduces a novel multimodal joint learning approach combining multi-camera and single-camera data with textual descriptions to improve person re-identification generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the challenge of generalizable person re-identification in unseen domains, leveraging stylistically diverse single-camera data enhanced with textual descriptions.

Method: ReText jointly optimizes three tasks during training: Re-ID on multi-camera data, image-text matching, and image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data.

Result: ReText demonstrates robust generalization and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks.

Conclusion: This paper is the first to explore multimodal joint learning combining multi-camera and single-camera data for image-based person re-identification, presenting a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.

*Hengyi Wang,Ruiqiang Zhang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy to enhance spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using geometry-grounded approaches, yielding substantial improvement on allocentric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with allocentric spatial queries requiring perspective shifts, limiting their effectiveness for spatially grounded tasks.

Method: The method employs off-the-shelf geometric experts to recover 3D states, aligns them with allocentric reference frames conditioned on queries, and prompts VLMs using structured geometry-grounded representations.

Result: The proposed strategy improves allocentric task performance by ~10% across various backbone VLM families without compromising egocentric capabilities.

Conclusion: Allocentric Perceiver effectively enhances spatial reasoning in VLMs via explicit computation, outperforming many specialized and proprietary models in allocentric tasks.

Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the FSR framework to improve inference efficiency in vision-language models through an innovative token pruning system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from high latency and memory usage due to large visual token generation, and existing methods for token pruning fail under aggressive compression.

Method: The Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR) framework leverages a three-step process: focus on key evidence, scan global context selectively, and refine by aggregating nearby informative details for efficient token pruning.

Result: FSR achieves consistent improvements in accuracy-efficiency balance when tested on various vision-language model backbones and benchmarks.

Conclusion: FSR provides a practical, human-inspired solution for efficient token pruning, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NVS-HO, a real-world benchmark for novel view synthesis using RGB inputs, tackling challenges in handheld object scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handheld objects’ novel view synthesis with RGB inputs in real-world settings lacks robust benchmarks.

Method: The paper designs NVS-HO consisting of two RGB sequences (handheld and board) and evaluates its effectiveness using NeRF and Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Experiments demonstrate performance gaps in current methods under handheld scenarios and establish NVS-HO as a complex benchmark.

Conclusion: NVS-HO provides a valuable benchmark to improve RGB-based novel view synthesis techniques for handheld objects.

Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weaver, a new multimodal reasoning system designed for video reasoning tasks, enhancing performance on complex benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of representational mismatch and limited perceptual acuity in text-centric multimodal reasoning systems.

Method: Weaver leverages a policy model to integrate diverse tools dynamically during the reasoning process and employs reinforcement learning for optimal strategy exploration.

Result: Weaver demonstrates improved performance on challenging video reasoning tasks, especially for tasks requiring analysis of long videos.

Conclusion: The system successfully showcases enhanced multimodal reasoning capabilities, establishing itself as a robust solution for video reasoning.

Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

Conclusion: UI-Mem demonstrates a superior ability for GUI agent learning by addressing credit assignment and experience transfer inefficiencies. Its hierarchical memory and evolving methods make it highly effective for generalization and long-term policy improvement in RL tasks.

Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

*Pierre-François De Plaen,Abhishek Jha,Luc Van Gool,Tinne Tuytelaars,Marc Proesmans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores issues with multi-crop strategies in Siamese self-supervised learning (SSL) networks and proposes assigning unique predictors for stability, achieving higher performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve stability and performance in SSL frameworks when using multi-crop strategies that combine global and local image views.

Method: The paper assigns distinct predictors for different view types, treating spatial transformations as separate alignment tasks, and adds masked cutout views to create a multi-task asymmetric Siamese SSL framework.

Result: The method shows enhanced stability and performance across SSL backbones like ResNet and ViT on ImageNet, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: By reformulating multi-crop SSL training as a multi-task approach, the proposed framework consistently improves network robustness and representation learning outcomes.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of error accumulation in long-sequence video synthesis by proposing a training-free technique, Test-Time Correction (TTC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for real-time short video synthesis struggle with generating extended video sequences due to drift and hypersensitivity in model parameters.

Method: The proposed Test-Time Correction (TTC) method uses the initial video frame as an anchor to stabilize intermediate states without requiring additional training.

Result: TTC effectively extends the length of video generation with minimal computational cost, achieving similar quality as resource-heavy training-based methods in 30-second tests.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for long-sequence video synthesis, balancing generation quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a robust boundary detection method capable of handling low-data scenarios, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing baselines, while being lightweight and adaptable.

Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size <500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Encoder-Only Change Detection (EoCD), a method addressing complexity and performance issues in change detection by eliminating sophisticated decoders and relying on a simple multiscale fusion technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods rely heavily on Siamese encoders and sophisticated decoders, leading to increased computational cost and model complexity, which needs simplification without compromising performance.

Method: The paper introduces EoCD, which applies early fusion for temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module.

Result: EoCD achieves an optimal balance between detection performance and prediction speed, and experiments on four datasets demonstrate its superior performance and reduced complexity.

Conclusion: EoCD effectively reduces model complexity, simplifies architecture by removing the decoder dependency, and performs better than existing methods across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper develops a method using a neural implicit function to reconstruct 3D cardiac shapes from sparse 2D planes in CT angiography, achieving high accuracy and improved results over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate 3D cardiac shape quantification from sparse 2D data, facilitating more reliable analysis of cardiac anatomy and function.

Method: A neural implicit function reconstructs 3D cardiac chambers and ventricular myocardium from sparse CTA planes, using multi-layer perceptron learning on 3D segmentations and optimizing latent code and transforms for 3D reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 and beats clinical standards, reducing volume errors significantly in left ventricle and atrium quantification compared to Simpson's biplane rule.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a promising avenue for accurate 3D cardiac chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLIP-Map, a novel framework to compress Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models using learnable matrices and Kronecker Factorization to maintain feature presentation under high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high memory and computational costs of CLIP models for resource-limited applications by overcoming the limitations of select-based compression methods that compromise feature representation, especially under extreme compression.

Method: The authors propose CLIP-Map, which uses learnable matrices and Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization to compress CLIP weights efficiently while retaining information. They also introduce Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to stabilize and streamline the optimization process.

Result: The proposed CLIP-Map surpasses traditional select-based compression methods across various compression scenarios. Particularly, it shows significant advantages under extreme compression settings, as demonstrated through extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: CLIP-Map offers an effective framework for compressing CLIP models, addressing computational challenges while retaining high feature representation quality, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a reliable CTTA method to overcome distribution shift challenges in medical image segmentation, while addressing error accumulation, forgetting, and privacy risks.

Method: Introduce MGIPT combining Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt for instance-specific adaptation and Multi-scale Global-level Prompt for domain-level adaptation, implemented via ensemble weighting.

Result: MGIPT achieves superior performance compared to existing CTTA methods, demonstrating robust adaptation across evolving target domains in medical image segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: MGIPT effectively mitigates limitations in CTTA methods by enhancing prompt diversity and capturing dual-level knowledge, ensuring robust and scalable adaptation for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improvements to flow matching in text-to-image models by designing better source distributions, showing improvements in stability, efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most flow matching approaches depend on a standard Gaussian distribution and disregard optimization of the source distribution itself. This paper seeks to address these limitations for conditional text-to-image systems.

Method: The authors propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under the flow matching objective; they employ variance regularization and directional alignment to address distributional collapse and instability issues.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved text-to-image generation, faster convergence (up to 3x FID improvements), and revealed regimes of effectiveness for structured source distributions.

Conclusion: Principled design of source distributions enhances conditional flow matching in modern text-to-image systems, providing robust and efficient generation improvements.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance realistic and scalable video generation for autonomous driving, especially focusing on improving dynamic object temporal consistency without requiring inference-time control signals.

Method: The framework fine-tunes pre-trained video generation models by introducing a semantic feature consistency loss. This loss aligns ground-truth and generated video clip features localized around dynamic objects, combined with standard diffusion loss.

Result: The fine-tuned model delivers improved evaluation metrics—including commonly used metrics and adapted ones (mAP and mIoU) for temporal consistency—tested extensively on nuScenes and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances temporal consistency in video generation, proving effective and generalizable, and avoids computational overheads or reliance on control signals during inference.

Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.

Conclusion: RISE-Video marks a step towards advancing generative models by emphasizing cognitive reasoning and providing structured evaluations for improvement.

Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.

TL;DR: VisRefiner introduces a framework to improve screenshot-to-code generation by learning from visual discrepancies between rendered outputs and designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal language models generate frontend code from screenshots but do not observe the visual effects of their outputs, unlike human developers who iteratively compare designs and implementations.

Method: VisRefiner trains models using difference-aligned supervision to associate visual discrepancies with code edits and incorporates a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement.

Result: The framework improves generation quality and fidelity, enabling models to better self-refine and match target designs more accurately.

Conclusion: Learning from visual differences enhances the screenshot-to-code translation process, making the generation more accurate and reliable.

Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods.

*Shuo Chen,Cong Wei,Sun Sun,Ping Nie,Kai Zhou,Ge Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Context Forcing', a framework to enhance long-context video generation by addressing the mismatch between student and teacher models, achieving significantly longer context lengths and improved consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current streaming tuning strategies for real-time long video generation rely on short-context teachers, limiting their ability to model global temporal dependencies. This mismatch caps the student model's capacity for long-term consistency.

Method: The authors propose 'Context Forcing', which trains long-context student models through a long-context teacher that maintains awareness of the full generation history. Additionally, they introduce a 'Slow-Fast Memory' architecture to manage computational feasibility for extreme durations.

Result: The proposed method achieves effective context lengths of over 20 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE by 2 to 10 times on long video evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 'Context Forcing' eliminates the teacher-student mismatch, enabling robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. It represents a significant improvement over existing approaches, offering superior performance in long video generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.

*David Shavin,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called Splat and Distill to enhance 3D awareness in 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) using a feed-forward process, achieving superior results on various 3D-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), while effective in 2D tasks, struggle with incorporating 3D awareness, limiting their applicability in tasks requiring spatial understanding.

Method: The framework uses a teacher-student model, where 2D features from a teacher model are lifted into a 3D Gaussian representation via a fast feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. These 3D features are splatted into novel viewpoints to supervise the student model, transferring geometrically grounded knowledge in a dynamic learning process.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior work across various downstream 3D tasks like monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation, demonstrating significant improvement in 3D awareness and semantic richness.

Conclusion: The Splat and Distill framework successfully addresses the lack of 3D awareness in 2D VFMs, providing an efficient methodology to improve 3D spatial understanding and outperforming existing methods in multiple evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

*Dongyang Chen,Chaoyang Wang,Dezhao SU,Xi Xiao,Zeyu Zhang,Jing Xiong,Qing Li,Yuzhang Shang,Shichao Ka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-Retrver, a multimodal retrieval framework emphasizing visual evidence verification to improve reasoning accuracy, achieving notable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval methods overly rely on static, passive visual information and often lead to conjectures in cases of visual ambiguity due to lack of active evidence verification.

Method: The proposed framework, V-Retrver, adopts agentic reasoning by enabling the model to gather visual evidence via external tools, conducting iterative reasoning between hypothesis formation and visual verification. The training involves a curriculum strategy integrating supervised learning, refinement, and reinforcement learning targeting evidence alignment.

Result: V-Retrver achieves a 23.0% average improvement in retrieval accuracy and shows enhanced reasoning reliability and generalization across multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Enhanced by evidence-driven approaches, V-Retrver introduces more reliable perception-based reasoning in multimodal retrieval, advancing the ability of models to actively verify and generalize in ambiguous scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.

### [238] [Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037)
*Haoyuan Li,Qihang Cao,Tao Tang,Kun Xiang,Zihan Guo,Jianhua Han,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoThinker is a novel framework for improving spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by shifting from passive geometry integration to active perception, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues of semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals in traditional passive fusion strategies for integrating geometric priors with MLLMs.

Method: Introduce GeoThinker, utilizing Spatial-Grounded Fusion with selective frame-strict cross-attention and Importance Gating to retrieve task-relevant geometric evidence effectively.

Result: GeoThinker achieves a peak performance score of 72.6 on VSI-Bench and enhances spatial perception in complex tasks such as embodied referring and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Active integration of geometric evidence is critical for advancing spatial intelligence in MLLMs, as demonstrated by GeoThinker's superior performance and robust generalization.

Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.

### [239] [SwimBird: Eliciting Switchable Reasoning Mode in Hybrid Autoregressive MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06040)
*Jintao Tong,Shilin Yan,Hongwei Xue,Xiaojun Tang,Kunyu Shi,Guannan Zhang,Ruixuan Li,Yixiong Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwimBird is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that adapts reasoning styles (text-only, vision-only, or interleaved) based on the input, improving both vision-intensive and text-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle to balance textual and visual reasoning, often degrading performance in one domain. A rigid reasoning pattern limits adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: SwimBird dynamically switches between three reasoning modes using a hybrid autoregressive model and a diverse reasoning-mode dataset (SwimBird-SFT-92K) for fine-tuning.

Result: SwimBird outperforms prior methods in both textual reasoning and visual understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Introducing adaptive reasoning significantly enhances multimodal understanding, providing robust and flexible performance in diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

### [240] [Predicting Camera Pose from Perspective Descriptions for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06041)
*Xuejun Zhang,Aditi Tiwari,Zhenhailong Wang,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMCUE tackles multi-image spatial reasoning by using camera poses for cross-view fusion and perspective reasoning, proving to be faster and more accurate compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with multi-image spatial reasoning, particularly in building 3D scene understanding across viewpoints and reasoning from new perspectives.

Method: The paper introduces CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that embeds camera poses into visual tokens, aligns language descriptions with camera poses, and synthesizes target views based on poses to answer perspective-shift questions.

Result: CAMCUE demonstrates a 9.06% accuracy improvement in reasoning tasks, achieves over 90% rotation and translation accuracy for pose prediction, and reduces inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example.

Conclusion: The pose-conditioned methodology enables efficient and accurate reasoning for multi-view images, making CAMCUE applicable to real-world, interactive scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper discusses findings from the Workflows Community Summit 2025, focusing on challenges and opportunities in scientific workflow adoption and sustainability, alongside proposed strategies for advancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address barriers to workflow adoption and utilization in scientific research, including improving reproducibility, sustainability, and collaboration across communities.

Method: Participants identified challenges through discussions at the summit and proposed actionable strategies involving technology, policy, and community development.

Result: Key problems like standardization issues, sustainability concerns, and insufficient recognition for workflow maintainers were highlighted. Strategies including better evaluation metrics, formalizing workflow patterns, community-building, and workforce investment were recommended.

Conclusion: The summit emphasizes advancing scientific workflows by driving better impact measurements, fostering collaboration, and investing in training and human capital to enhance reproducibility and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific workflows have become essential for orchestrating complex computational processes across distributed resources, managing large datasets, and ensuring reproducibility in modern research. The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives. This document presents the summit's findings, beginning with an overview of the current computing ecosystem and the rationale for workflow-centric approaches, followed by a discussion of identified challenges and recommended action lines for advancing scientific discovery through workflows.

### [243] [ORACL: Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05292)
*Haoyu Bai,Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam,Minxian Xu,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ORACL utilizes large language models (LLMs) to enhance autoscaling in microservices by providing reasoning-driven and interpretable resource allocation decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoscaling policies either rely on complex learned models requiring extensive training or simplistic rules prone to failure in diverse microservice architectures.

Method: ORACL leverages LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning, transforming telemetry data into semantic descriptions and diagnosing issues to recommend optimized resource allocations.

Result: Experimental results show ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15%, speeds up training by 24x, and enhances quality of service by 6%, without requiring retraining for specific deployments.

Conclusion: ORACL demonstrates that LLMs can serve as effective resource allocators for microservices, improving adaptability and decision-making without deployment-specific configuration.

Abstract: Applications are moving away from monolithic designs to microservice and serverless architectures, where fleets of lightweight and independently deployable components run on public clouds. Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments.
  We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining.

*Shubham Mishra,João Gonçalves,Chawinphat Tankuranand,Neil Giridharan,Natacha Crooks,Heidi Howard,Chris Jensen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Proteus integrates Byzantine fault-tolerance within crash-fault-tolerant consensus, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments strategically for resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing vulnerabilities of hardware Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in distributed ledgers by introducing additional integrity measures.

Method: Proteus embeds Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) into a crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) protocol without additional messaging by aligning their structures.

Result: Proteus delivers performance comparable to TEE-enabled protocols while maintaining integrity even amidst TEE compromises.

Conclusion: Proteus enhances distributed consensus security by mitigating risks associated with TEE vulnerabilities, ensuring trustworthy ledger operations.

Abstract: Distributed ledgers are increasingly relied upon by industry to provide trustworthy accountability, strong integrity protection, and high availability for critical data without centralizing trust. Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns. Proteus achieves performance in line with regular TEE-enabled consensus protocols, while guaranteeing integrity in the face of TEE platform compromises.

### [245] [Reaching Univalency with Subquadratic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05356)
*Andrew Lewis-Pye*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study revolves around dissecting the Dolev-Reischuk bound, establishing that reaching univalency in Byzantine Agreement does not require quadratic messaging; rather, this bound arises from disseminating the outcome. The paper introduces efficient protocols for relaxed and authenticated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to examine the longtime interpretation of the Dolev-Reischuk lower bound and to discern whether the quadratic messaging cost is because of reaching consensus (univalency) or just disseminating outcomes in Byzantine Agreement settings.

Method: The authors achieve this by introducing $ε$-BA, a relaxed form of Byzantine Agreement, allowing a small error fraction. They also present Extractable BA for authenticated scenarios, analyzing their communication complexities.

Result: They find that $ε$-BA reduces communication to $O(n \log n)$ under certain fault tolerances and that Extractable BA achieves $O(f \log f)$ complexity. Thus, dissemination, rather than univalency, causes quadratic costs.

Conclusion: This work redefines the understanding of the Dolev-Reischuk bound, pointing to outcome dissemination as the primary contributor to quadratic communication costs in Byzantine Agreement. Efficient alternatives for both relaxed and authenticated settings are proposed.

Abstract: The Dolev-Reischuk lower bound establishes that any deterministic Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol for $n$ processors tolerating $f$ faults requires $Ω(f^2+n)$ messages. But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $Ω(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?
  We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $ε$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $ε$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - ε)$. Crucially, any $ε$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $ε$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $ε$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \log f)$.

*Seonghye Cho,Jaemin Han,Hyunjin Kim,Euisoo Jung,Jae-Gil Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TimelyFreeze optimizes pipeline parallelism for model training, reducing throughput limitations caused by pipeline bubbles while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pipeline bubbles restrict the throughput of pipeline parallelism in training large models, and current methods over-freeze parameters, causing accuracy degradation.

Method: TimelyFreeze models the pipeline schedule as a directed acyclic graph, leveraging linear programming to optimize parameter freeze ratios and minimize batch execution time within accuracy constraints.

Result: Experiments indicate that TimelyFreeze enables training throughput improvements of up to 40% without sacrificing model accuracy.

Conclusion: TimelyFreeze enhances large-scale model training by increasing efficiency across pipeline-parallel settings without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Pipeline parallelism enables training models that exceed single-device memory, but practical throughput remains limited by pipeline bubbles. Although parameter freezing can improve training throughput by adaptively skipping backward computation, existing methods often over-freeze parameters, resulting in unnecessary accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose TimelyFreeze, which models the pipeline schedule as a directed acyclic graph and solves a linear program to compute optimal freeze ratios that minimize batch execution time under accuracy constraints. Experiments show that TimelyFreeze achieves up to 40% training throughput improvement on LLaMA-8B with comparable accuracy. Overall, it enables faster large-scale model training without compromising convergence and generalizes across diverse pipeline-parallel settings.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION where robots must occupy distinct nodes matching their assigned colors, in anonymous networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address enhanced coordination in distributed robotics by factoring color constraints into robot placement, which extends DISPERSION to more practical scenarios.

Method: The authors propose deterministic algorithms to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION with guarantees on time and memory, while establishing impossibility and lower bounds for deterministic solutions.

Result: The study established the feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and quantified its increased challenge compared to regular DISPERSION.

Conclusion: The algorithms developed demonstrate the practicality of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION and underline its complexity relative to DISPERSION, paving the way for further exploration in distributed robotic coordination.

Abstract: The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.
  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.

*Luke Whitbread,Lyle J. Palmer,Mark Jenkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for normative modeling in neuroimaging, enabling calibrated multivariate deviation profiling and improved dependence modeling while scaling efficiently to high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models for neuroimaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) often discard multivariate dependence even though such dependencies might encode critical patterns. The aim is to develop a robust, joint modeling method for calibrated multivariate deviation profiling while retaining compatibility with standard pipelines.

Method: The paper proposes employing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for joint conditional density estimation of IDPs, enabling derivation of centiles and deviation scores through sampling. Two architectures, a FiLM-conditioned MLP and a SAINT-based transformer, are used as denoiser backbones.

Result: DDPMs exhibit better calibration for outputs, especially with the transformer backbone, effectively scaling from low to high dimensions. They deliver superior multivariate dependency modeling and outperform traditional methods in normative modeling benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based normative modeling is a promising approach for multivariate neuroimaging analysis, providing calibrated deviation profiles while improving computational scalability and preserving structural dependences.

Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.

*Licheng Pan,Yunsheng Lu,Jiexi Liu,Jialing Tao,Haozhe Feng,Hui Xue,Zhixuan Chu,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Causal Analyst, a framework to analyze and manage jailbreak mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) using causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving the safety of LLMs by identifying the mechanisms responsible for jailbreaks, as these remain poorly understood through traditional analysis methods.

Method: Causal Analyst integrates LLM-based prompt encoding with graph neural network (GNN)-based causal graph learning, applied to a dataset of 35k jailbreak attempts annotated with interpretable prompt features, to identify causal relationships.

Result: The study identifies specific prompt features, such as 'Positive Character' and 'Number of Task Steps', as direct causes of jailbreaks. These insights enable a Jailbreaking Enhancer, which boosts attack success rates, and a Guardrail Advisor, which aids in detecting malicious intent.

Conclusion: Analyzing jailbreaks through a causal lens provides an effective and insightful method for enhancing the reliability and safety of LLMs, as demonstrated by robust empirical evaluations and practical applications.

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

### [250] [Momentum Attention: The Physics of In-Context Learning and Spectral Forensics for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04902)
*Kingsuk Maitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Momentum Attention,' an extension to Transformers incorporating principles from Hamiltonian physics, enabling single-layer induction and enhanced spectral analysis of signal types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing, offering a new perspective on Transformers by incorporating physical priors to overcome existing architectural constraints.

Method: The authors introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation based on physical principles. Utilizing the concept of kinematic momentum, they bypass topological depth constraints for induction head formation in Transformers and validate their framework through extensive experiments.

Result: The proposed model excels in induction-heavy tasks, achieving comparable or better performance to larger baseline models, with a derived scaling law for momentum-depth fungibility.

Conclusion: This framework advances the interpretability and architectural capabilities of Transformer-based models, leveraging a novel symplectic augmentation approach to integrate physical and computational perspectives.

Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.

### [251] [A logical re-conception of neural networks: Hamiltonian bitwise part-whole architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04911)
*E Bowen,R Granger,A Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new system processes relations like part-whole intrinsically within its architecture, combining low-cost computational operations with symbolic computation features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an architecture fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural networks, capable of directly encoding relations as part of its basic functioning while reducing computational costs.

Method: A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator processes graphs encoded with elemental pairwise relational codes, leveraging low-precision arithmetic and achieving low computational costs that scale linearly with data size.

Result: The system identifies logical relational structures like part-of and next-to, building hierarchical representations suitable for standard ANN examples and symbolic computation-like inferential steps.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates a possible merge of ANN and symbolic methods, offering promise for improvements in semantic representation and inviting further exploration of its implementation.

Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.

*Eitan Sprejer,Oscar Agustín Stanchi,María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Iván Arcuschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature steering effectively modifies LLM behavior but significantly degrades performance. Simple prompting balances control and quality better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the practical effectiveness of feature steering in real-world scenarios, assessing its trade-offs with output quality, especially compared to prompt engineering.

Method: Evaluated the Auto Steer feature steering method against prompt engineering across 14 steering queries and 171 MMLU questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control.

Result: Auto Steer effectively modifies behaviors but causes notable performance degradation. Accuracy dropped drastically on Llama-8B (66% to 46%) and Llama-70B (87% to 73%) with reduced coherence scores. Prompting achieved a better balance.

Conclusion: Feature steering methods, while effective at controlling behaviors, lead to significant trade-offs in task performance, highlighting limitations for practical use and the need to empirically analyze these trade-offs before deployment.

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

### [253] [DCER: Dual-Stage Compression and Energy-Based Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04904)
*Yiwen Wang,Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCER, a multimodal fusion framework addressing issues with noisy inputs and missing modalities through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal fusion often suffers from input noise degrading representation quality and prediction failures due to missing modalities.

Method: The approach involves dual-stage compression using frequency transforms to remove noise and cross-modal bottleneck tokens for integration. Energy-based reconstruction is employed for missing modalities.

Result: DCER achieved state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS datasets, showing robustness in various conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances multimodal fusion, proving its reliability and robustness in dealing with noisy and incomplete data scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

TL;DR: LISA is a time-series inference method that adapts using observed prefixes, improving state representation and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance time-series model adaptability at inference under changing dynamics using minimal additional computation.

Method: Combines delay-coordinate embeddings, Laplacian spectral learning, and lightweight residual adaptation.

Result: LISA demonstrates improved performance over frozen baselines, especially in changing dynamics.

Conclusion: LISA links in-context adaptation with spectral methods, contributing to robust time-series forecasting models.

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.

### [255] [Physics as the Inductive Bias for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04907)
*Jianhong Chen,Naichen Shi,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method combining physics-based models and data-driven approaches for improved causal discovery in dynamical systems using stochastic differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating physical knowledge with data-driven causal discovery in dynamic systems, especially those with feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary trends.

Method: The study models system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), combining known ODE dynamics with unknown causal influences, and develops a scalable algorithm using sparsity-inducing MLE.

Result: The proposed method showed improved causal graph recovery and produced more consistent estimates compared to state-of-the-art baselines when tested on diverse dynamic systems.

Conclusion: This integrative approach enhances the identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems by leveraging partial physical knowledge and addressing limitations of traditional causal methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

### [256] [Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04908)
*Chika Maduabuchi,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a method to reduce variance and improve efficiency in continuous-time generative models without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time generative models suffer from high estimator variance due to their independent treatment of timesteps during training, which reduces sampling efficiency.

Method: TPC couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same path to reduce variance, working at the estimator level without altering model architecture or training approaches.

Result: TPC demonstrates improved sampling quality and efficiency, achieving lower FIDs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at lower computational costs compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: TPC provides an effective and seamless variance-reduction solution that enhances generative model performance while integrating well with current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

### [257] [Learning Where It Matters: Geometric Anchoring for Robust Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04909)
*Youngjae Cho,Jongsuk Kim,Ji-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), a method for aligning large language models using a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor to address issues in preference-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address problems with distributional mismatch caused by static reference policies and unconstrained reward drift in preference optimization for large language models.

Method: GAPO utilizes a dynamic anchor, determined by local perturbations of the current policy, to create a pessimistic baseline. This enables adaptive reweighting of preference pairs and emphasizes robust signals by incorporating an Anchor Gap metric.

Result: GAPO improves model robustness under noisy settings and enhances or maintains performance in alignment and reasoning benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: A geometry-aware dynamic approach like GAPO mitigates issues arising from static references, improving alignment robustness and performance when training large language models.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

### [258] [A$^2$-LLM: An End-to-end Conversational Audio Avatar Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04913)
*Xiaolin Hu,Hang Yuan,Xinzhu Sang,Binbin Yan,Zhou Yu,Cong Huang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A$^2$-LLM is an advanced conversational digital human model integrating language, audio, and facial motion into one framework for enhanced expressiveness and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for conversational digital humans face challenges like error accumulation, high latency, and limited emotional depth due to their modular design.

Method: The authors developed A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end model trained with FLAME-QA, a multimodal dataset that connects semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics.

Result: The model demonstrates emotionally detailed facial movements, surpassing lip-sync-only approaches, with real-time efficiency of 500 ms latency and 0.7 RTF.

Conclusion: A$^2$-LLM offers a significant step forward in creating expressive, responsive conversational digital humans by combining multiple modalities in an end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

### [259] [SLAY: Geometry-Aware Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat-Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04915)
*Jose Miguel Luna,Taha Bouhsine,Krzysztof Choromanski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a linear-time attention mechanism, SLAY, using spherical constraints and innovative kernel formulations for efficient computation, yielding high performance closely matching standard softmax attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of scaling attention mechanisms in Transformers by creating efficient linear-time solutions without sacrificing performance.

Method: SLAY utilizes the spherical Yat-kernel for geometry-aware attention, leveraging polynomial-exponential product kernel approximations and random-feature methods for linear-time computation constrained to unit spheres.

Result: SLAY achieves nearly indistinguishable performance from softmax attention while outperforming prior linear-time mechanisms like Performers and Cosformers, with significant scalability for larger datasets.

Conclusion: SLAY offers the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention to date, providing scalable attention for Transformers without compromising accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

### [260] [Multi-Aspect Mining and Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Tensor Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04917)
*Soshi Kakio,Yasuko Matsubara,Ren Fujiwara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeteroComp, a method for analyzing tensor streams with timestamps and diverse attributes to detect group anomalies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods struggle with heterogeneous data streams containing both categorical and continuous attributes and fail to effectively manage timestamp dynamics for group-level anomaly detection.

Method: HeteroComp uses Gaussian process priors to model distributions and temporal dynamics, continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into components for anomaly detection.

Result: HeteroComp achieves superior group anomaly detection accuracy compared to existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency, regardless of data stream length.

Conclusion: HeteroComp provides an effective solution for summarizing and detecting anomalies in heterogeneous tensor streams, addressing the limitations of current methods in handling diverse attributes and temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

*Arno Geimer,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedRandom, a novel technique aimed at mitigating contribution estimation instability in Federated Learning setups through statistical sampling enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of instability in contribution estimation for participants in Federated Learning, which impacts fair assessments, trust, and engagement while considering costs and malicious actors.

Method: FedRandom is proposed as a statistical estimation technique to generate additional samples, improving the consistency and reliability of contribution evaluations in Federated Learning.

Result: FedRandom demonstrates reduced instability and improved accuracy in contribution assessments, lowering the distance to ground truth by more than a third in various scenarios and increasing stability in over 90% of cases.

Conclusion: FedRandom enhances fairness and reliability in participant contribution assessments by reducing instability, thereby fostering trust and engagement in decentralized Federated Learning systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

### [262] [Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918)
*Long Zhang,Fangwei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often prioritize conflicting in-context information over their existing knowledge, resolved via angular interference rather than reducing representation magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why LLMs tend to prioritize conflicting context despite their pre-existing knowledge, termed sycophancy, and whether this is due to changes in signal magnitude or geometric direction.

Method: Conducted layer-wise geometric analysis of residual streams in three LLMs, decomposing updates into radial and angular components.

Result: Two out of three models exhibited stable residual norms despite performance degradation, revealing compliance as angular rotation rather than magnitude suppression.

Conclusion: Models maintain internal magnitude but employ angular displacement to simulate compliance, challenging scalar confidence metrics and requiring vectorial monitoring for distinguishing genuine integration from mimicry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gradual compacting method (PTL) to reduce the size of Large Language Models while preserving performance in reasoning tasks, achieving significant compression with minimal post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce the computational resources and accelerate inference of Large Language Models without significantly impacting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: A gradual compression technique using a Prune-Tune Loop, performed in iterative, fine-grained stages to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance through finetuning.

Result: PTL successfully compresses Large Language Models to nearly half their original size while maintaining comparable performance with only lightweight post-training. It also shows flexibility across various pruning strategies and tasks.

Conclusion: PTL effectively addresses the challenge of reducing LLM size without compromising reasoning performance and demonstrates broad applicability across different tasks and compression strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

*Ronghao Lin,Qiaolin He,Sijie Mai,Ying Zeng,Aolin Xiong,Li Huang,Yap-Peng Tan,Haifeng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CyIN, a framework enhancing multimodal machine learning by addressing performance issues caused by missing modalities using an information bottleneck and cyclic reconstruction approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning often relies on perfectly paired modalities, but real-world scenarios involve unpredictable missing modalities, leading to performance drops. This paper aims to make models robust against such issues.

Method: The authors build an informative latent space using token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among modalities and propose a cross-modal cyclic translation for reconstructing missing modalities through forward and reverse propagation.

Result: Experiments on 4 multimodal datasets show the effectiveness of CyIN in both complete and various incomplete multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: CyIN successfully bridges the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning, offering robustness through efficient latent feature extraction and reconstruction.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates that SGD prefers flatter solutions if the noise across label dimensions is isotropic and sharper solutions for anisotropic noise distributions, with findings validated across neural network architectures.

Conclusion: SGD itself does not have an inherent preference for flatness but is influenced by label noise distributions, leading to sharp or flat minima depending on noise characteristics.

Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.

*Sepehr Mousavi,Siddhartha Mishra,Laura De Lorenzis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve neural operators' ability to handle complex boundary conditions in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators struggle with general and highly variable boundary conditions in PDE solutions.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that maps boundary data to pseudo-extensions across entire domains, facilitating the integration with standard operator learning architectures.

Result: The methodology was tested on 18 datasets with various equations and boundary conditions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and outperforming existing methods significantly.

Conclusion: This strategy demonstrates robust application of neural operators to complex boundary conditions, broadening their usability in scientific machine learning for PDE problems.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

*Poushali Sengupta,Sabita Maharjan,Frank Eliassen,Shashi Raj Pandey,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Explanation Reliability Index (ERI) to measure and quantify the stability of explanations from machine learning models under various realistic conditions, revealing reliability shortcomings in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability of explanations provided by widely-used machine learning methods (e.g., SHAP, IG) under realistic conditions and make explainable AI systems more reliable.

Method: The authors proposed metrics called ERI and ERI-T to measure explanation reliability based on four axioms and developed ERI-Bench for systematic testing. Formal guarantees and benchmarks were utilized for evaluation.

Result: Experimental analysis shows that current explanation methods fail to remain stable under conditions such as small input perturbations and minor model updates, highlighting their reliability issues.

Conclusion: The work exposes shortcomings of explanation stability in machine learning models and provides tools to assess and improve the reliability of explainable AI systems.

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Reliable Audio-Visual Question Answering (R-AVQA) focusing on abstention over incorrect answers. It introduces Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR) to improve confidence calibration and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored aspect of confidence-based abstention in AVQA models, reducing incorrect responses by introducing mechanisms to judge uncertainty effectively.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), which uses Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) and supplements it with two learned heads: a Residual Risk Head for improving correctness estimation and a Confidence Gating Head for assessing MSP reliability.

Result: ACR consistently improves performance across in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and data bias settings in three AVQA architectures, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: ACR significantly strengthens the $R$-AVQA framework for reliable decision-making in AVQA tasks, providing a robust approach to enhance model abstention mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

*Zhenning Shi,Yijia Zhu,Junhan Shi,Xun Zhang,Lei Wang,Congcong Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STIR, a dynamic framework to improve reasoning tasks in models, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning processes in models, overcoming limitations of static control vectors which do not adapt to complex thinking tasks.

Method: The STIR framework utilizes a three-stage pipeline: dynamic reasoning harvesting, sparse tool creation, and context-adaptive injection for enhanced results.

Result: STIR improved accuracy by 1.9%-7.5% and reduced token consumption by up to 35% across multiple benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: Dynamic dynamic latent trajectory control offers an efficient alternative to explicit chain-of-thought processes, improving reasoning fidelity and compute efficiency.

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Euphonium, a novel framework for improving training efficiency and alignment in reinforcement learning-based flow matching models, focusing on guided sampling via reward gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in reinforcement learning training rollouts due to inefficient exploration, relying on stochastic methods and sparse rewards.

Method: Proposes Euphonium, formulating sampling as a Stochastic Differential Equation incorporating gradient-guided dynamics for dense steering, accompanied by a distillation objective to eliminate reward model dependency at inference.

Result: Euphonium achieves better alignment with human preferences and accelerates training convergence by 1.66x in text-to-video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Euphonium improves guided exploration, optimizes efficiency, and aligns models better than previous methods, showing theoretical robustness and practical advancements.

Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

*Jiecheng Lu,Xu Han,Yan Sun,Viresh Pati,Yubin Kim,Siddhartha Somani,Shihao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linear attention methods reduce complexity to $O(N)$ but often underperform. ZeroS removes limitations to enhance performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in linear attention methods, including restricted blending and bias affecting long contexts.

Method: ZeroS introduces zero-sum weights, enabling positive and negative values for contrastive operations within $O(N)$ complexity.

Result: ZeroS empirically outperforms or matches standard softmax attention on sequence modeling benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZeroS is a mathematically stable, efficient enhancement to linear attention models, improving functionality and empirical performance.

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TurboBoA enhances post-training quantization (PTQ) efficiency for large language models (LLMs) with improved speed and accuracy over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce memory and computation costs in LLMs has escalated, and existing methods like GPTQ and BoA have limitations in low-bit accuracy or efficiency.

Method: TurboBoA introduces joint out-channel quantization, error correction mechanisms, and adaptive grid computation to accelerate PTQ while preserving accuracy.

Result: Experiments show substantial speed improvements and accuracy gains, establishing state-of-the-art performance in weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Conclusion: TurboBoA effectively addresses efficiency and accuracy limitations in PTQ for LLMs, providing a practical and high-performing solution.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational phases within large language models and how their internal representations transform context into predictions.

Method: The study employs a combination of geometric analysis and mechanistic intervention to explore representational dynamics and prediction mechanisms in late-layer representations.

Result: The late-layer representations show structured geometric coding, where angular geometry determines prediction similarities, while norms encode context-specific information.

Conclusion: This work provides an integrated mechanistic and geometric explanation of how context transforms into predictions in LLMs, illustrating representational reorganization in computation phases.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HC-GCD, a new method combining hyperbolic representations and hyperbolic clustering for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), showing competitive performance and improved clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the suboptimal nature of using Euclidean geometry for clustering in hyperbolic GCD methods, seeking to unify representation learning and clustering in hyperbolic space.

Method: HC-GCD employs embeddings within the Lorentz Hyperboloid model and clusters these embeddings using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm.

Result: HC-GCD matches state-of-the-art performance, improves clustering accuracy over Euclidean K-Means, and exhibits consistent clusters across varying label granularity.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic clustering improves GCD accuracy and representation consistency, proving advantageous over prior methods relying partially on Euclidean geometry.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of optimizing data mixtures for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in Multimodal Large Language Models by leveraging model merging as a proxy for efficient mixture evaluation, thereby reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the bottleneck of determining optimal mixture weights across domain-specific datasets for SFT in multimodal models, which involves high computational cost and complexity.

Method: The study uses model merging of domain-specific experts via parameter interpolation as a proxy for assessing performance across data mixtures. This avoids direct training on multiple data mixtures and evaluates their efficacy indirectly.

Result: Experiments conducted on 14 multimodal benchmarks show a high rank correlation between merged proxy models and models trained on actual data mixtures, validating the efficiency of the approach.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a scalable strategy to estimate optimal data mixtures efficiently by decoupling it from resource-intensive training processes, offering a practical solution to the DMO problem.

Abstract: Selecting the best data mixture is critical for successful Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

Conclusion: Transolver-3 successfully provides high-fidelity field predictions for industrial-scale simulations, proving scalable neural PDE solvers for complex engineering problems.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM), a trainable framework for central tendency learning, and quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs) as models utilizing NKM for set data processing. QUANNs outperform baselines and provide transferable embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for handling set-structured data use fixed pooling operations, which limit model transferability and expressivity. Learnable aggregation functions are proposed as alternatives.

Method: Introduced a novel framework, Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM), for trainable central tendency calculations, and integrated it into quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs). Provided theoretical analysis of their universal approximation capabilities.

Result: QUANNs showed state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and demonstrated better transferability of learned embeddings to other tasks.

Conclusion: QUANNs, incorporating the NKM framework, improve model expressivity for sets and provide effective, transferable embeddings, advancing capabilities in set-function modeling.

Abstract: Sets represent a fundamental abstraction across many types of data. To handle the unordered nature of set-structured data, models such as DeepSets and PointNet rely on fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (e.g., sum or max) -- a design choice that can hinder the transferability of learned embeddings and limits model expressivity. More recently, learnable aggregation functions have been proposed as more expressive alternatives. In this work, we advance this line of research by introducing the Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) -- a novel, trainable framework for learning a generalized measure of central tendency through an invertible neural function. We further propose quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs), which incorporate the NKM as a learnable aggregation function. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, QUANNs are universal approximators for a broad class of common set-function decompositions and, thanks to their invertible neural components, learn more structured latent representations. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, while learning embeddings that transfer effectively even to tasks that do not involve sets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework combining joint embedding and variational inference for self-supervised, probabilistic representation learning without reliance on reconstruction or contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a probabilistic representation learning framework that avoids the limitations of pointwise optimization techniques and contrastive objectives, providing stability and rich uncertainty modeling.

Method: VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional ELBO for latent-variable models on embeddings, using a Student-t likelihood model with polar decomposition to mitigate training instabilities, and employs a Gaussian variational posterior to model uncertainty.

Result: The method achieves comparable performance to non-contrastive baselines on linear and k-NN evaluation benchmarks and excels in likelihood-based anomaly detection on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: VJE demonstrates potential as a reconstruction-free and non-contrastive approach with robust probabilistic semantics, highlighting its ability to perform competitively in representation learning and anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to distill capabilities learned with privileged information into models that act without it by introducing π-Distill and On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privileged information at training time aids learning in reinforcement settings, but transferring such skills to inference models without PI remains a core challenge, especially in multi-turn agentic environments.

Method: The paper introduces two algorithms: π-Distill, which jointly trains a privileged-information-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student, and OPSD, which employs RL with a reverse KL-penalty to distill using action-only privileged information.

Result: Both π-Distill and OPSD effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning and RL setups across benchmarks and model architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable effective use of privileged information for training, yielding better-performing models in environments where direct reasoning processes are obscured.

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in understanding SGD using existing frameworks and introduces a new method for studying these limitations in specific models and settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding of inherent limitations of SGD when applied to learning models, with a special focus on scenarios where existing SQ frameworks fail.

Method: A novel, non-SQ framework is proposed to analyze the limitations of standard (vanilla) SGD in single-index and multi-index models.

Result: The proposed framework is applicable to multiple settings and architectures, including deep neural networks, offering broad insights into SGD's limitations.

Conclusion: The paper resolves shortcomings of existing methods by offering a detailed understanding of SGD's performance in various learning scenarios via a new framework.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a stochastic optimization framework for efficiently calibrating physical models, validated with plasma-surface interaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently calibrate physical models with high-dimensional parameters while minimizing simulation costs and ensuring robust inference.

Method: Develops a hierarchical optimization framework incorporating reduced Hessian approximations and probabilistic objective loss functions.

Result: The method outperformed baseline techniques in sample efficiency, especially in computationally expensive plasma-surface interaction models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable optimization tool applicable to a variety of complex reaction systems.

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

*Binghui Li,Kaifei Wang,Han Zhong,Pinyan Lu,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizer mitigates slow convergence caused by imbalanced learning rates in Gradient Descent, achieves superior scaling efficiency, and demonstrates empirical gains. It acts as a matrix preconditioner leveraging adaptive task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Gradient Descent in optimizing systems with hierarchical frequency spectra, particularly its slow progress caused by imbalanced rates in learning frequency components.

Method: The study systematically examines the behavior of the Muon optimizer in a linear associative memory model. It analyzes its scaling law and preconditioning effects under noiseless and noisy settings.

Result: Muon optimizer achieves exponential speedup in noiseless cases and superior scaling efficiency over Gradient Descent in noisy cases. It aligns gradients adaptively, mitigating bottlenecks and enhancing progress.

Conclusion: Muon optimizer provides faster and more uniform optimization dynamics than Gradient Descent, leveraging adaptive structures in learning tasks and outperforming conventional methods in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents new online matching algorithms using a coarsening approach to cluster offline nodes for improved theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online matching algorithms in domains like internet advertising and organ allocation often lack strong theoretical guarantees. Addressing this gap is critical for improved decision-making.

Method: The authors propose aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters using coarsening techniques to explore structural properties and create near-optimal policies.

Result: The proposed methodology is applied to heart transplant allocation; simulation results demonstrate close performance to an omniscient benchmark.

Conclusion: This study bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical bounds in organ allocation, validating clustering-based approaches with rigorous theoretical justification.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

### [284] [ReFORM: Reflected Flows for On-support Offline RL via Noise Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05051)
*Songyuan Zhang,Oswin So,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Eric Yang Yu,Matthew Cleaveland,Mitchell Black,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReFORM is an offline RL method that enforces a less restrictive support constraint using flow policies, outperforming baselines across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces challenges like out-of-distribution (OOD) errors when the policy strays from training data and the difficulty of representing multimodal optimal policies.

Method: ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with bounded source distribution to capture action support and optimizes a reflected flow for bounded noise, ensuring support while improving performance.

Result: ReFORM outperforms other offline RL methods across 40 tasks from the OGBench benchmark with a consistent hyperparameter setup.

Conclusion: ReFORM successfully addresses OOD errors while maintaining policy expressiveness and achieves superior results compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

*Floris Jan Koster,Fabio Sigrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates hyperparameter optimization methods for tree-boosting techniques using 59 datasets, finding SMAC outperforms others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining optimal hyperparameters is crucial for improving the performance of tree-boosting models on tabular data.

Method: Comparison of multiple hyperparameter optimization techniques, including random grid search, TPE, GP-BO, Hyperband, SMAC, and deterministic grid search across 59 datasets.

Result: SMAC method consistently outperforms other techniques; large trial numbers are required for accurate tuning; default hyperparameters perform poorly; all hyperparameters significantly impact accuracy.

Conclusion: SMAC is the best optimization method for tree-boosting; large trials and early stopping improve accuracy.

Abstract: Tree-boosting is a widely used machine learning technique for tabular data. However, its out-of-sample accuracy is critically dependent on multiple hyperparameters. In this article, we empirically compare several popular methods for hyperparameter optimization for tree-boosting including random grid search, the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), Gaussian-process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), Hyperband, the sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) method, and deterministic full grid search using $59$ regression and classification data sets. We find that the SMAC method clearly outperforms all the other considered methods. We further observe that (i) a relatively large number of trials larger than $100$ is required for accurate tuning, (ii) using default values for hyperparameters yields very inaccurate models, (iii) all considered hyperparameters can have a material effect on the accuracy of tree-boosting, i.e., there is no small set of hyperparameters that is more important than others, and (iv) choosing the number of boosting iterations using early stopping yields more accurate results compared to including it in the search space for regression tasks.

*Ioannis Anagnostides,Itai Zilberstein,Zachary W. Sollie,Arman Kilic,Tuomas Sandholm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the importance of integrating incentives into the design of machine learning-based organ allocation systems, specifically focusing on US adult heart transplants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address misaligned incentives in the current organ allocation system that negatively impact outcomes, and to improve allocation methods to ensure fairness and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a research agenda combining mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to incorporate incentive-awareness.

Result: The paper identifies existing incentive misalignments in the organ allocation process, supported by adverse data consequences.

Conclusion: To tackle current challenges, the next-gen allocation systems should prioritize incentive-aware frameworks to improve robustness, efficiency, and fairness.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

*Yu-Ang Lee,Ching-Yun Ko,Pin-Yu Chen,Mi-Yen Yeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and compares LoRA and its variants for efficient LLM fine-tuning, finding that different methods achieve similar results when optimized hyperparameters are used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically re-evaluate LoRA and its variants by addressing the potential inconsistencies in reported improvements that might stem from narrow hyperparameter tuning.

Method: The authors conducted extensive hyperparameter searches across mathematical and code generation tasks using various model scales to reevaluate four LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA.

Result: The results show that, when learning rates are properly tuned, all LoRA methods achieve similar peak performance (~1-2% difference), with small rank-dependent behaviors.

Conclusion: Vanilla LoRA remains a strong baseline despite alternative methods, and reported improvements in the variants may not demonstrate genuine methodological advantages when tested across broader settings.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

*Atula Tejaswi,Litu Rout,Constantine Caramanis,Sanjay Shakkottai,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EntRGi, a mechanism to enhance reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models by dynamically regulating reward gradients, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations in reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models caused by techniques using continuous relaxations or straight-through estimators.

Method: EntRGi modulates continuous relaxation via confidence-based regulation to improve reward feedback and provide reliable inputs for the reward model.

Result: EntRGi demonstrates consistent improvements in language model performance across diverse reward models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic modulation of reward gradients via EntRGi leads to better test-time adaptation and reliable guidance in discrete diffusion language modeling.

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the stability and flexibility of learning in the Transformer architecture by enabling non-Euclidean norm usage in query and key vector normalization.

Method: The method involves generalizing the QKNorm normalization scheme using Lp norms to explore a broader range of normalization approaches.

Result: Experimental results indicate the method is suitable for addressing a simple problem, showing promise for further investigation.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that the proposed Lp norm-based normalization method could be a viable alternative for key and query vector normalization, though further validation is required.

Abstract: The normalization of query and key vectors is an essential part of the Transformer architecture. It ensures that learning is stable regardless of the scale of these vectors. Some normalization approaches are available. In this preliminary work, a generalization of the QKNorm normalization scheme is proposed. The approach is based on the Lp norm, allowing non-Euclidean norms to be employed. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the method for a simple problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for confidence estimation in CT reconstructions, demonstrating how deep learning methods provide more precise results with interpretable uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to establish confidence estimation for CT reconstructions, addressing the need for reliable and interpretable methods to quantify uncertainty in medical imaging.

Method: It employs a sequential likelihood mixing framework, paired with realistic forward models and deep learning paradigms such as U-Nets and generative models, to achieve reliable confidence regions.

Result: Deep learning methods produce tighter confidence intervals compared to classical techniques while maintaining theoretical guarantees. It also identifies hallucinations and visualizes uncertainty.

Conclusion: Deep learning CT reconstructions are both accurate and reliable, supporting their use in uncertainty-aware medical imaging applications.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy concerns in in-context learning for large language models by proposing a novel framework, improving accuracy compared to previous methods while maintaining robust privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks associated with in-context learning in large language models, which can inadvertently disclose sensitive information from in-context examples.

Method: The paper introduces a Product-of-Experts model reformulation for differentially private in-context learning, enabling parallelization and improving efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Result: Across evaluations on five datasets, their method shows over 30 percentage points accuracy improvement on average while adhering to strong privacy standards.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances private in-context learning with better accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a theoretically grounded method for future applications in privacy-sensitive settings.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: This paper integrates node-associated data into the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to improve community detection capabilities, providing theoretical thresholds and efficient algorithms for exact recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Community detection is essential in diverse applications, and existing theoretical frameworks lack considerations for additional node attributes common in real-world network data.

Method: The study proposes the Data Block Model (DBM), defines the Chernoff--TV divergence to establish thresholds, and develops algorithms that achieve exact recovery with additional vertex-related data.

Result: Sharp recovery thresholds are derived for the DBM, corroborated by an efficient algorithm and converses, with simulations showing improved community detection leveraging node-associated data.

Conclusion: Incorporating node-associated data significantly enhances community detection in networks, and the presented thresholds and algorithms offer a robust theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verdú (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses constrained contextual bandits with adversarial contexts, proposing a modular reduction-based algorithm for controlling regret and constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of managing constrained contextual bandits in adversarial environments, enabling control over both regret and cumulative constraint violations.

Method: The authors develop a modular algorithm leveraging online regression oracles to transform constrained problems into standard unconstrained contextual bandit problems with adaptive surrogate reward functions.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves improved guarantees for handling adversarial contexts, outperforming prior work which largely focuses on simpler stochastic contexts.

Conclusion: The study offers a compact and transparent approach to constrained contextual bandits in adversarial settings, extending previous frameworks and improving performance guarantees.

Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance interpretability and utility of graph neural networks by introducing counterfactual graph learning for actionable decision-making in recommender systems.

Method: CFRecs consists of a two-stage architecture using a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to propose minimal impactful changes in graphs.

Result: CFRecs demonstrates effectiveness in generating actionable recommendations for Zillow’s user-listing interaction data.

Conclusion: CFRecs showcases how counterfactual reasoning in graph structures can transform recommendations into strategic, actionable insights, especially in competitive domains like housing.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.

Motivation: Adversarial attacks pose threats to machine learning models' robustness. This paper aims to address these challenges by constructing a mechanism that improves defense under strong perturbations.

Method: The authors employ entropy principles to develop a lifelong ensemble learning technique and propose an immunization mechanism for transfer-based attacks.

Result: The proposed logifold method shows superior accuracy, particularly under strong adversarial perturbations, compared to naive ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: The entropy-based lifelong ensemble approach improves performance and robustness against adversarial attacks effectively.

Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) and improving alignment tasks in various settings, particularly using environmental rewards.

Method: The paper leverages $f$-divergences to propose methods such as $f$-GRPO and $f$-HAL for on-policy and hybrid optimization in reinforcement learning and PA tasks.

Result: The proposed methods showed theoretical improvements and performed better empirically in alignment tasks like Math Reasoning and Safety Alignment.

Conclusion: The framework and methods enhance reward-based alignment, showing theoretical and empirical superiority over existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-time planning in model-based reinforcement learning by leveraging state representations that support local cost computation while maintaining the long-horizon structure.

Method: The paper employs the Laplacian representation for preserving state-space distances across time scales, and introduces ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, which uses this representation for effective state decomposition and error mitigation in long-horizon tasks.

Result: The ALPS algorithm outperforms baseline methods on offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from the OGBench benchmark.

Conclusion: Laplacian representations, with their ability to preserve meaningful distances and facilitate subgoal decomposition, provide a powerful latent space for model-based planning, enabling effective long-horizon decision-making.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Conclusion: Training robust neural certificates enhances safe RL performance under dynamics perturbations, addressing critical real-world reliability challenges.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers, improving their performance in sampling tasks, and generalises these samplers for bridging distributions and data-free posterior sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited exploration in applying diffusion sampling techniques to discrete space, and existing approaches do not fully translate successful ideas from the continuous domain.

Method: Introducing off-policy training strategies for discrete diffusion samplers and generalising their use for bridging arbitrary distributions in discrete domains.

Result: Improved performance of discrete samplers on synthetic benchmarks and new applications, such as data-free posterior sampling in discrete latent spaces.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion sampling can be significantly enhanced using off-policy training methods and generalised for broader applications such as bridging distributions and posterior sampling.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

*Jiaxu Ren,Yixin Wang,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops MUTATE, a framework for learning causal representations of continuous-time stochastic processes and applies it effectively in studies like genomics and neuron dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitating machine learning and scientific breakthroughs by learning causal relationships from observations, especially in settings with continuous-time stochastic processes.

Method: Introduces MUTATE, a framework utilizing variational autoencoders with a time-adaptive transition module for inferring continuous-time stochastic dynamics.

Result: MUTATE demonstrates effectiveness in simulated and empirical scenarios, identifying processes like genomic mutations and neuron spike triggers.

Conclusion: MUTATE provides an effective framework for identifying causal relationships in continuous-time stochastic systems, supporting scientific inquiry in complex domains.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

### [301] [Inverse Depth Scaling From Most Layers Being Similar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05970)
*Yizhou Liu,Sara Kangaslahti,Ziming Liu,Jeff Gore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Depth impacts loss in large language models (LLMs), scaling inversely proportional to depth, with layering showing ensemble averaging tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how model depth specifically influences performance in large language models (LLMs) and residual networks.

Method: Analyzed depth scaling in LLMs and toy residual networks, evaluating layer behaviors and functional mechanisms like error reduction and target function compatibility.

Result: Loss decreases inversely with depth, driven by ensemble averaging rather than compositional or smooth dynamic mechanisms.

Conclusion: Efficiency in LLMs can be enhanced by new architectures that better utilize depth compositionally instead of ensemble averaging.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.

*Karish Grover,Theodore Vasiloudis,Han Xie,Sixing Lu,Xiang Song,Christos Faloutsos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ControlG, a method to address the challenge of multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs, avoiding interference and instability between multiple objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing toolbox of graph SSL objectives, but combining them effectively is difficult due to conflicts, instability, and resource misallocations during training.

Method: ControlG uses control-theoretic solutions for temporal allocation of optimization budgets, integrating a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner and a PID controller to dynamically schedule multi-objective training.

Result: ControlG outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 9 datasets, providing stable schedules and revealing the impact each objective had on learning.

Conclusion: ControlG successfully addresses the challenges of multi-task graph SSL by providing robust optimization and auditable temporal allocations, improving performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

*Leo Zhang,James Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), a novel attention mechanism addressing instability in Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) for Transformers without skip connections and normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the instability issues of SSA when used in skipless architectures, which impair representation learning due to rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians.

Method: OSA ensures orthogonality of the attention matrix by mapping a skew-symmetric query-key structure through matrix exponential, coupled with computational efficiency through low-rank query-key manipulation.

Result: OSA achieves linear scaling in computational complexity and memory costs relative to sequence length, while introducing a well-conditioned Jacobian via a specially designed initialization scheme.

Conclusion: OSA resolves SSA's instability, enabling effective training of non-causal Transformers devoid of skips or normalization techniques.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

### [304] [Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014)
*Shunxing Yan,Han Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how incorporating optimism can stabilize Thompson Sampling (TS) for multi-armed bandits, enabling valid asymptotic inference even under adaptive data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling faces challenges with inferential validity due to the adaptive and random nature of arm-specific sample sizes in multi-armed bandits.

Method: The authors analyze variance-inflated TS and propose an alternative optimistic modification with mean bonuses for posterior means in $K$-armed Gaussian bandits.

Result: Both variance-inflated TS and the alternative optimistic modification prove to be stable for any number of arms $K \ge 2$, ensuring asymptotically valid inference.

Conclusion: Stabilizing TS via optimism allows sound inferential properties while maintaining only a mild additional regret cost.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework using TensorGalerkin for solving, optimizing, and learning PDEs, achieving high efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and challenges in solving, optimizing, and learning variational PDEs, especially in computational and physics-informed contexts.

Method: A unified framework based on Galerkin discretization combined with TensorGalerkin architecture for efficient numerical operations using GPU optimization and sparse matrix reductions.

Result: Demonstrated substantial computational efficiency and accuracy improvements across various benchmarks, including different types of PDEs in 2D and 3D unstructured meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed TensorGalerkin-based framework is highly effective for diverse applications such as numerical solutions, optimization, and operator learning of PDEs, outperforming traditional baselines.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

*Wen Zhang,Adel W. Sadek,Chunming Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid framework to recommend real-time safe freeway travel speeds under various weather conditions, using data-driven and physics-based methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve traffic safety and reduce weather-related crashes by providing real-time adjustments to safe driving speeds under adverse weather conditions.

Method: The study employs a Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) model combining high-resolution Connected Vehicle data and Road Weather Information System data to predict vehicle speed distributions. It integrates physics-based safety constraints for enhanced precision and practical deployment.

Result: The QRF model achieves strong predictive performance with a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, accurately capturing median speed in 96.43% of cases within 5 mph and exhibiting robust generalization across varying weather conditions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for real-world application, effectively adapting to dynamic conditions, aiding in reducing weather-induced crash risk, and enhancing road safety.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

Motivation: To address the growing threat of cybergrooming to youth through preventive, educational tools.

Method: An offline reinforcement learning (RL) dialogue agent, StagePilot, was designed. It uses stage-based progression of grooming behaviors with rewards considering user sentiment and goal alignment. Constraints ensure realistic and interpretable transitions.

Result: StagePilot achieves realistic and coherent conversation modeling, with the best method, IQL+AWAC, reaching the final stage 43% more frequently than baselines while ensuring emotional alignment over 70%.

Conclusion: StagePilot proves to be a functional training tool for cybergrooming prevention, offering effective stage-wise simulations combined with emotional engagement and strategic planning.

Abstract: Cybergrooming is an evolving threat to youth, necessitating proactive educational interventions. We propose StagePilot, an offline RL-based dialogue agent that simulates the stage-wise progression of grooming behaviors for prevention training. StagePilot selects conversational stages using a composite reward that balances user sentiment and goal proximity, with transitions constrained to adjacent stages for realism and interpretability. We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics. Among tested methods, the IQL+AWAC agent achieves the best balance between strategic planning and emotional coherence, reaching the final stage up to 43% more frequently than baselines while maintaining over 70% sentiment alignment.

*Roger Girgis,Rodrigue de Schaetzen,Luke Rowe,Azalée Robitaille,Christopher Pal,Liam Paull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Constrained GRPO, an extension of GRPO for policy optimization under explicit behavioral constraints, solving challenges with distorted advantage estimation to enhance performance in constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO lacks mechanisms for explicit behavioral constraints, which are critical for certain AI applications, particularly in ensuring ethical and practical policy implementation.

Method: The authors extend GRPO using a Lagrangian-based approach to enforce constraints effectively. They address distortions in advantage estimation by introducing a scalarized advantage computation.

Result: Restoration of stable constraint control in toy gridworld experiments and enhancement in constraint satisfaction without compromising task success in robotics tasks.

Conclusion: Constrained GRPO provides a robust solution for policy optimization in scenarios requiring behavioral constraints, proving effective both theoretically and empirically, with potential applications in embodied AI domains.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

*Wenting Li,Saif R. Kazi,Russell Bent,Duo Zhou,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid verifier for neural network robustness that utilizes an efficient branch-and-bound framework combining upper and lower bound optimization using NLP-CC to offer faster and scalable formal robustness verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness concerns in neural networks limit their use in critical applications, and while formal verification offers robustness guarantees, methods often struggle with scalability and completeness.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid verifier based on a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework, leveraging an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding, warm-starting NLP solves, and pattern-aligned strong branching.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved upper bounds than PGD, faster per-node solves, and significant speedups compared to existing MIP-based verification methods on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: This work advances neural network verification by enhancing scalability and efficiency in robustness validation.

Abstract: Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $ε-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical fairness challenges in strategic classification, focusing specifically on the underexplored individual fairness.

Method: Analysis of threshold-based classifiers, proving deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness; development of randomized classifiers through linear programming for fairness optimization.

Result: Optimal randomized classifiers ensure fairness and address group fairness notions while experiments validate improvements in fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Randomized classifiers effectively resolve individual unfairness in strategic classification and achieve broader fairness objectives.

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

*Parsa Vares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoDiscover framework is introduced to enhance systematic literature review (SLR) screening using adaptive decision-making and graph-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening in SLRs faces challenges due to the growing scientific output, low prevalence of relevant studies, and limited expert availability.

Method: AutoDiscover uses a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) for document relationships and a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent to dynamically adapt query strategies during active learning.

Result: AutoDiscover outperformed static active learning baselines on the SYNERGY benchmark by increasing screening efficiency and overcoming challenges with minimal initial labels.

Conclusion: The framework speeds up SLR processes by addressing scarce expert labels challenges through a combination of adaptive strategies and advanced modeling techniques, supported by an analytic dashboard named TS-Insight.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a stochastic gradient method for optimizing combinatorial problems over a hypercube, requiring only one query for unbiased computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of multiple queries required for exact gradient computation in probabilistic reformulation of combinatorial problems.

Method: Introducing a stochastic gradient approach that is unbiased and leverages importance sampling for single-query optimization.

Result: The method generalizes REINFORCE and introduces new classes of stochastic gradients.

Conclusion: The proposed stochastic gradient method simplifies optimization in combinatorial problems while maintaining unbiasedness and efficiency.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rubrics are increasingly used to guide LLM judges for subjective human preferences and as reward signals in reinforcement fine-tuning, but challenges like lack of control and redundancy persist. The proposed RRD framework uses a recursive decompose-filter cycle to refine rubrics, improving judgment accuracy and training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in rubric generation for guiding LLM judges, such as lack of control, redundancy, and misalignment, which hinder judge accuracy and training rewards for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Method: The RRD framework employs a recursive decompose-filter cycle to refine rubrics by expanding coverage, removing misaligned/redundant criteria, and applying correlation-aware weighting to produce non-redundant, informative rubric sets.

Result: RRD improved preference-judgment accuracy on benchmarks like JudgeBench, outperforming prior methods with up to +17.7 points. It enhanced reinforcement fine-tuning rewards by up to 160% in some models and demonstrated transferable gains across varied domains.

Conclusion: RRD provides a scalable and interpretable solution to rubric refinement for LLM judging and reward modeling, enabling better accuracy and learning signals in open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

TL;DR: SemPipes introduces a programming model integrating LLM-powered semantic operators for tabular ML pipelines, enhancing performance and simplifying complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing data preparation pipelines in tabular ML requires significant domain expertise, inspiring the exploration of LLMs to automate and simplify this process.

Method: SemPipes combines natural language-defined semantic data operators with runtime execution and LLM-based evolutionary search to optimize task-specific data transformations.

Result: The approach improves predictive performance for diverse tabular ML tasks and reduces the complexity of both expert-designed and automated pipelines.

Conclusion: SemPipes demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven declarative programming in tabular ML, offering improved pipeline efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity.

### [315] [Decoupled Orthogonal Dynamics: Regularization for Deep Network Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05136)
*Hao Chen,Jinghui Yuan,Hanmin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques AdamW's weight decay approach, introduces a new optimizer called AdamO, and demonstrates its superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Radial Tug-of-War where weight decay in AdamW conflicts with the learning dynamics of parameter gradients, causing instability and potential degradation in feature learning.

Method: Proposed Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling (AdamO), which separates the control of parameter norm and feature directions via an SGD-style update for norm and adaptive adjustments for tangential subspaces.

Result: AdamO improved generalization and stability in experimental results across vision and language tasks compared to AdamW.

Conclusion: AdamO effectively resolves the conflicts posed by traditional weight decay in AdamW, providing better stability and performance without introducing significant complexity.

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

*Jikai Jin,Kenneth Hung,Sanath Kumar Krishnamurthy,Baoyi Shi,Congshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes state-model-free bandit algorithms to tackle challenges in environments with hidden, time-varying states, demonstrating superior performance over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical multi-armed bandit algorithms struggle in environments with unobserved confounders and time-varying states, leading to biased estimates and sub-optimal actions.

Method: The authors introduce bandit algorithms that use lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies to track latent states implicitly, without explicit state modeling.

Result: Empirical results show that these algorithms outperform classical multi-armed bandit methods across diverse non-stationary settings.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms provide computational efficiency and adaptability, enabling robust performance in real-world, non-stationary environments.

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

### [317] [Fairness Under Group-Conditional Prior Probability Shift: Invariance, Drift, and Target-Aware Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05144)
*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on fairness in machine learning under group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where label prevalence changes differently across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of fairness in machine learning when historical data used for training does not reflect conditions at deployment due to shifts in label prevalence across demographic groups.

Method: The study distinguishes fairness invariance criteria under GPPS, identifies target-domain fairness metrics without target labels using ROC invariance, and proposes TAP-GPPS, a label-free algorithm for adjusting fairness and correcting posteriors.

Result: TAP-GPPS achieves demographic parity in the target domain with minimal loss in utility, supported by theoretical and experimental validation.

Conclusion: GPPS affects fairness differently across criteria. The proposed TAP-GPPS can handle these shifts effectively while maintaining fairness and performance.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

*Jiyoung Park,Hankyu Jang,Changseok Song,Wookeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIDE is a serving-engine-native framework that enhances speculative decoding for LLM inference, achieving improved throughput and reduced training time by reusing hidden states and using adaptive runtime control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realizing the practical benefits of speculative decoding in LLM inference is challenging due to changing workloads and system limitations.

Method: TIDE integrates hidden state reuse as training signals, employs runtime adaptive control for selective activation, and utilizes heterogeneous clusters for better resource allocation.

Result: TIDE improves throughput by up to 1.15x and reduces draft training time by 1.67x compared to conventional speculative decoding approaches.

Conclusion: By integrating draft adaptation into inference systems, TIDE demonstrates effective optimization for real-world workloads while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

*Wonjun Yi,Rismaya Kumar Mishra,Yong-Hwa Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-task learning framework for fault classification using coupled physical information in signals, demonstrating superior performance across benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fault classification in machine systems by leveraging the physical coupling in their signals instead of relying solely on fault labels.

Method: A multi-task learning framework with crosstalk architecture was used, built upon a residual neural dimension reductor model, applied to two benchmark datasets.

Result: The approach outperformed single-task, multi-class, and shared trunk models in classifying faults across drone and motor compound fault datasets.

Conclusion: Using physical coupling information through multi-task learning can enhance fault classification accuracy in machine systems.

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

### [320] [CoSA: Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05148)
*Songtao Wei,Yi Li,Bohan Zhang,Zhichun Guo,Ying Huang,Yuede Ji,Miao Yin,Guanpeng Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoSA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large language models, overcoming limitations of low-rank approaches and showing superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods for adapting large language models rely on low-rank weight update assumptions, which can restrict expressivity in task-specific scenarios.

Method: CoSA leverages compressed sensing theory, using random projection matrices and a learnable core to represent weight updates in a compact and expressive way without relying on low-rank constraints.

Result: The proposed method is formally analyzed and extensively tested on 10 diverse tasks across natural language processing models, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

Conclusion: CoSA provides an efficient and expressive framework for large language model adaptation, showcasing its effectiveness in various tasks and outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

*Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui,Eleni Triantafillou,David Krueger,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on methods for controlling the capabilities of foundation models to prevent misuse and malfunction, proposing a layered and comprehensive approach to capability control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the risks of misuse and failures in foundation models due to their broad generalist abilities and highlights the need for effective controls to limit harmful behaviors.

Method: The authors present a layered framework for capability control across three stages: data-level restrictions, learning-level interventions, and post-deployment system-level guardrails, advocating for their combined use.

Result: The paper organizes capability control into a structured framework and identifies potential failure modes of relying on individual layers without integration.

Conclusion: The authors propose a defense-in-depth approach to capability control and highlight critical challenges like dual-use concerns and the need for compositional generalization in achieving robust operational limits.

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

*Kevin Han,Yuhang Zhou,Mingze Gao,Gedi Zhou,Serena Li,Abhishek Kumar,Xiangjun Fan,Weiwei Li,Lizhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel method addressing stability challenges in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), outperforming traditional approaches like GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dominant RLVR methods suffer stability challenges like high estimator variance and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes, limiting effective training.

Method: EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator combining local group baselines and global statistics updated via Welford’s online algorithm, ensuring robust reward signals and reduced variance.

Result: EBPO showed enhanced training stability, lower MSE, and superior performance across benchmarks like AIME and OlympiadBench, even under small group sizes and difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Conclusion: EBPO effectively mitigates RLVR stability issues, offering consistent improvement across diverse settings, making it an impactful advancement over traditional methods like GRPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

TL;DR: This study compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification in the Gulf of Mexico, with the Spatio-Temporal Transformer achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coastal hypoxia poses ecological and economic threats, requiring fine-scale daily predictions for effective management, unlike coarse seasonal models.

Method: The study tested BiLSTM, Medformer, ST-Transformer, and TCN architectures using 12 years of training data (2009-2020) and hindcast test data (2020-2024). The dataset included parameters such as stratification and oxygen consumption.

Result: All models displayed high classification accuracy, with the ST-Transformer achieving top performance (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). McNemar's test confirmed significant prediction differences among models.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust, reproducible framework for real-time hypoxia prediction, aiding environmental and ocean management, and offers open-source code for further use.

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

*John Yan,Michael Yu,Yuqi Sun,Alexander Duffy,Tyler Marques,Matthew Lyle Olson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and LLM-based summarization for analyzing LLM behaviors during complex reinforcement learning training, providing new insights into training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding behavior changes and the emergence of strategic patterns in large language models during multi-agent reinforcement learning training is challenging, demanding better interpretability methods.

Method: The authors apply pretrained SAEs and LLM-based summarizers to Full-Press Diplomacy environment data, introducing Meta-Autointerp, a grouping method for interpreting SAE features in the dynamics of RL training.

Result: Significant behaviors, role-playing patterns, dynamics of reward hacking, and strategic insights were discovered. Automated evaluations validated 90% of SAE-derived features as impactful, with downstream task utility in specific cases.

Conclusion: While SAEs and LLM-based hypotheses can find useful data-centric behaviors and provide some predictive improvements, their interpretative utility for humans remains limited. Their insights can complement future LLM interpretability efforts to promote trustworthy models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

*Chun-Wun Cheng,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) are enhanced with input-conditioned spectral operators, introducing SpectraKAN, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spectral operators in neural frameworks fail to adapt dynamically to multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic system states, limiting their efficacy in solving PDEs.

Method: SpectraKAN uses input-conditioned spectral operators by extracting compact global representations from spatio-temporal history and employing cross-attention to adapt multi-scale Fourier trunks dynamically.

Result: SpectraKAN achieves significant improvement, reducing RMSE by up to 49% compared to existing methods, especially excelling in complex spatio-temporal scenarios.

Conclusion: SpectraKAN, by conditioning spectral operators on input, offers a more adaptable and efficient framework, establishing itself as a new state-of-the-art for PDE-related tasks.

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

*Wentao Ni,Kangqi Zhang,Zhongming Yu,Oren Nelson,Mingu Lee,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli,Jongryool Kim,Zhijian Liu,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention method for LLMs to improve efficiency in long-context inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies in large language model inference caused by growing key-value caches and the limitations of existing sparse attention methods.

Method: Double-P uses a two-stage hierarchical sparse attention process with cluster-level coarse-grained estimation followed by adaptive token-level refinement.

Result: Double-P reduces attention computation by up to 1.8x, achieves near-zero accuracy drop, and boosts decoding speed by up to 1.3x compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The Double-P framework provides an efficient and scalable approach to optimize sparse attention in LLMs for long-context inference, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

*Changhoon Song,Teng Yuan Chang,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes exPreCast, a computationally efficient deterministic framework for precipitation nowcasting, supported by a newly balanced radar dataset to enhance forecasting of both normal and extreme rainfall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution radar observations have not fully overcome challenges in precipitation nowcasting, such as spatial locality, intricate rainfall structures, forecasting variability, and skewed benchmark datasets.

Method: The exPreCast framework utilizes local spatiotemporal attention, a cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor, alongside a balanced radar dataset combining ordinary and extreme rainfall.

Result: Experiments on SEVIR, MeteoNet, and balanced KMA datasets show that exPreCast outperforms existing methods, providing accurate nowcasts across various rainfall conditions.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel, resource-efficient model resolving biases in deterministic approaches and enhancing real-world applicability for extreme weather forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

TL;DR: The paper presents a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, improving semantic alignment and factor independence. It introduces a non-overlap regularizer and achieves better disentanglement performance across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of strong semantic alignment in existing diffusion-based methods for disentangled representation learning.

Method: A flow matching-based framework is introduced, with a non-overlap regularizer to reduce cross-factor interference and information leakage.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show improved disentanglement scores, better controllability, and superior sample fidelity compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances factor independence and semantic alignment, offering significant improvements for disentangled representation learning.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper explores reducing the query dependence from $\sqrt{T}$ to polylogarithmic in $T$ for differential privacy in prediction tasks, aiming for better efficiency against adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differential privacy in prediction tasks often faces challenges in scaling efficiently with the number of queries. The authors aim to improve these scaling issues to make private prediction more practical.

Method: The authors utilize advanced theoretical techniques and algorithms to achieve a polylogarithmic dependence on $T$, instead of the standard $\sqrt{T}$. They address both oblivious and adaptive online adversaries with different concept classes.

Result: They derived improved sample complexities for private predictors: polylogarithmic dependence in $T$ for oblivious online adversaries, and refined bounds for adaptive adversaries using halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$.

Conclusion: The paper provides novel methods to significantly reduce dependence on the number of queries, advancing the efficiency of differentially private prediction algorithms in adversarial environments.

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is crucial in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity. Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.

### [331] [Faithful Bi-Directional Model Steering via Distribution Matching and Distributed Interchange Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05234)
*Yuntai Bao,Xuhong Zhang,Jintao Chen,Ge Su,Yuxiang Cai,Hao Peng,Bing Sun,Haiqin Weng,Liu Yan,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Concept DAS (CDAS), a novel method for intervention-based model steering that avoids overfitting by aligning intervened and counterfactual output distributions. CDAS is tested on diverse benchmarks and case studies, showing promising results in safety-related tasks while maintaining general model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering methods often overfit and produce unnatural outputs because they rely on optimizing external preferences instead of identifying internal causal mechanisms faithfully.

Method: The authors propose CDAS, which adapts distributed alignment search (DAS) principles by introducing distribution matching tailored for steering tasks, using bi-directional distributed interchange interventions (DII).

Result: CDAS delivers robust steering on the AxBench benchmark and safety-related case studies, demonstrating its stability and faithfulness. It works particularly well with larger model scales and complements existing preference-optimization methods.

Conclusion: CDAS represents a novel and promising approach to model steering by focusing on distribution alignment rather than preference optimization. Its scalability and stability make it a complementary and robust option for intervention-based steering.

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

*Boxiang Zhang,Baijian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORP, a framework for structured pruning of Vision Transformers that operates in a single closed-form step without retraining or fine-tuning, offering significant efficiency improvements with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for pruning Vision Transformers are resource-intensive, requiring retraining or multi-stage optimization, which hinders their practical post-training deployment.

Method: CORP uses a closed-form ridge regression approach for structured pruning without labels or gradients, leveraging a small unlabeled calibration set to model removed components and adjust model weights for representational accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong redundancy in Vision Transformers' representations. CORP achieves substantial sparsity while maintaining accuracy, reducing MLP and attention structures by 50% while retaining 82.8% Top-1 accuracy in DeiT-Huge, completing the process in under 20 minutes.

Conclusion: CORP provides an efficient and practical solution for post-training structured pruning of Vision Transformers, enabling fast computation and real-world efficiency gains without significant accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TADS, a framework for efficient multi-task multimodal pre-training that selects and curates high-quality training data, enhancing zero-shot performance while significantly reducing data usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies in training and suboptimal generalization caused by noisy, misaligned, and redundant data in web-crawled datasets used by models like CLIP.

Method: TADS integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function, using a meta-learning mechanism to optimize data selection for multiple tasks.

Result: TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of CC12M data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%.

Conclusion: The approach enhances data efficiency by selecting a high-utility subset, enabling better generalization and performance within the same computational resources.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.

*David Alejandro Trejo Pizzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the memory limitations in deploying Large Language Models on edge devices by introducing Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), combining ternary quantization with FP16 corrections, showing improved performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory bandwidth constraints in deploying LLMs on edge devices while retaining model quality and training stability.

Method: Propose Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture using a ternary backbone and FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.

Result: HGF achieves superior performance with reduced memory overhead (12-15%) and improved validation loss on TinyStories dataset. Larger-scale experiments show scalability.

Conclusion: HGF effectively mitigates the memory footprint while maintaining performance quality and scaling to larger models.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.

*Pengyi Li,Elizaveta Goncharova,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of low-entropy policies in reinforcement learning for Large Language Models by proposing a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) to enhance generative diversity and reasoning output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse and limited output diversity in reinforcement learning optimization for LLMs, which is caused by standard methods disproportionately reinforcing high-likelihood reasoning paths.

Method: The paper introduces Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM), utilizing Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence to reshape reward signals. This method reduces gradient updates for over-confident paths and redistributes probability mass toward correct but under-explored solutions.

Result: ARM enhances generative diversity, response entropy, and achieves superior trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models show significant performance improvements in mathematical and coding tasks, including a notable 13.9% improvement in Pass@32 accuracy on Qwen2.5-7B.

Conclusion: The proposed ARM method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and improves the diversity of reasoning outputs, balancing accuracy and exploration in LLM tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

*Minhuan Li,Jiequn Han,Pilar Cossio,Luhuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmbedOpt, a method for guiding diffusion models to align biomolecular conformations with experimental constraints by optimizing in the conditional embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling for biomolecular conformations often struggles in low-prior-density regions, requiring unstable weighting of experimental likelihoods.

Method: The EmbedOpt method conducts optimization for inference within the conditional embedding space, which captures sequence and coevolutionary signals, aligning diffusion priors with experimental constraints.

Result: EmbedOpt surpasses posterior sampling in cryo-EM map fitting, matches performance on distance constraints, ensures robust parameter engineering, and achieves efficiency by reducing diffusion steps.

Conclusion: EmbedOpt effectively addresses limitations of posterior sampling, demonstrating superior alignment with experimental constraints, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

*Dahai Yu,Lin Jiang,Rongchao Xu,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes HealthMamba, a framework designed for reliable and accurate predictions of healthcare facility visits, integrating spatiotemporal modeling and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing healthcare facility visit prediction models fail to incorporate spatial dependencies and struggle to provide reliable predictions during abnormal situations such as emergencies.

Method: HealthMamba uses a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder, Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba, and three uncertainty quantification mechanisms to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved prediction accuracy by around 6.0% and uncertainty quantification by 3.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods, evaluated on datasets from multiple states.

Conclusion: HealthMamba advances healthcare visit prediction with superior spatiotemporal modeling and reliable uncertainty quantification, setting a new standard for prediction performance in normal and abnormal conditions.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Feng Zhu,Robert W. Heath,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper offers a unified convergence analysis of SAG, SAGA, and IAG algorithms for finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proofs for SAG, SAGA, and IAG algorithms are complex and disparate, with SAG requiring computer-aided analysis, necessitating a unified framework.

Method: The authors created a unified framework for analyzing these algorithms using concentration tools for delay bounds and a novel Lyapunov function.

Result: The analysis provides high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA, extends to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling, and significantly improves the rates for IAG algorithms.

Conclusion: This unified analysis simplifies convergence proofs and broadens applicability while improving algorithm rates, enhancing understanding and usability of these methods.

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

*Yinan Huang,Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu,Junran Wang,Bo Dai,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Sequential Flow Matching, a framework for streaming prediction using Bayesian filtering, significantly reducing sampling steps for faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high inference latency and inefficiency in real-time sequential prediction using traditional diffusion and flow-matching models.

Method: The authors propose using Bayesian filtering to design Sequential Flow Matching, which recursively updates predictive distributions, optimizing real-time streaming predictions by leveraging posterior initialization rather than naive re-sampling.

Result: Sequential Flow Matching demonstrates competitive performance with traditional methods across various tasks, achieving comparable accuracy with significantly reduced sampling steps and faster inference times.

Conclusion: The study establishes that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering can enhance the efficiency and deployment of flow-based models in real-time applications.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), an algorithm designed to tackle challenges in Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) by enhancing data stitching and balancing reward maximization with constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address two challenges in OSRL systems using Generative Models: their inability to stitch optimal trajectories and the difficulty in balancing conflicting reward and cost objectives.

Method: The authors propose GAS, which relabels and augments datasets to create high-quality trajectories, employs expectile regression to estimate goal functions for better trade-offs, and reshapes data distribution to improve training stability.

Result: The proposed GAS algorithm achieves superior performance in simultaneously optimizing rewards and adhering to constraints, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: GAS effectively improves OSRL by overcoming key limitations of Generative Model-based approaches, demonstrating better balance between performance and constraint adherence.

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical limits for pool-based active learning using information-theoretic principles, addressing gaps in understanding its label complexity and generalization error.

Method: The study reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem, enabling finite blocklength analysis to derive information-theoretic lower bounds.

Result: The derived bounds highlight factors such as overfitting, inductive bias, and their effect on learning, providing a theoretical perspective on pool-based active learning.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into data selection and learning processes in pool-based AL, connecting with established theories while introducing a new perspective.

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

TL;DR: The paper proposes relaxed unitary graph convolutions, generalizing them for meshes to address oversmoothing issues in graph neural networks for dynamics modeling of physical systems, and demonstrates superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks face oversmoothing issues when modeling dynamics in physical systems, demanding a balance between smoothness preservation and the natural smoothing effects.

Method: It introduces relaxed unitary convolutions balancing smoothness properties and generalizes them to meshes for better dynamics modeling in PDEs and physical processes.

Result: The proposed method outperformed strong baselines like mesh-aware transformers in experiments on PDEs, including complex meshes, and weather forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: Relaxed unitary convolutions offer a balance between combating oversmoothing and accommodating natural smoothness, improving modeling in physical systems and PDEs over complex surfaces.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

### [343] [Bayesian Neighborhood Adaptation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05358)
*Paribesh Regmi,Rui Li,Kishan K C*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework to adaptively determine the optimal neighborhood scope for GNNs' message aggregation, enhancing expressivity and achieving better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require a fixed, pre-specified neighborhood scope for graph neural networks, which is time-consuming to determine and prone to bias. The challenge of adaptively finding suitable neighborhood scopes, especially for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, has not been addressed effectively.

Method: The paper models message-passing in GNNs as a stochastic process using a beta process to infer optimal neighborhood scopes during parameter optimization. This adaptive approach determines the most suitable number of hops for message aggregation.

Result: The proposed method improves expressivity in GNNs, shows compatibility with current GNN variants, and achieves competitive or superior node classification results on benchmark datasets. It also offers well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: The adaptive approach to neighborhood scope determination enhances GNN performance and expressivity, offering a promising direction for both homophilic and heterophilic graph applications.

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

*Hongyi Li,Han Lin,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), a novel method for constructing oblique decision trees that aims to address NP-hard challenges using advanced optimization techniques, delivering powerful and interpretable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and quality of oblique decision tree learning, overcoming the limitations of slow searches and theory-free heuristics in existing methods.

Method: The paper frames each tree split as a non-linear least-squares problem using linear predictors with max/min envelope for enhanced expressiveness. It uses an alternating fitting procedure akin to damped Newton methods, including backtracking line search and optional ridge regularization.

Result: HRT exhibits fast and stable convergence, proving to be a universal approximator with $O(δ^2)$ approximation rates. Empirical testing demonstrates that it outperforms single-tree baselines on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks while maintaining compact structures.

Conclusion: HRT provides a robust and interpretable approach to oblique decision trees, combining theoretical guarantees with strong empirical performance and universal approximation capabilities.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a solution to the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge when merging models trained on different tasks, which skews the model toward shared subspaces and degrades performance.

Method: The authors propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing approach. SVC identifies overlap in singular vectors (aligned spectral directions) and rescales inflated singular values to ensure a balanced spectrum in the merged model.

Result: SVC consistently improves merging baselines across vision and language tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also enhances the Task Arithmetic method, improving its performance by 13.0%.

Conclusion: By addressing the inflation of singular values from shared spectral directions during model merging, SVC offers a significant improvement over existing methods and provides a simple, practical post-processing step for combining fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

### [346] [Erase at the Core: Representation Unlearning for Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05375)
*Jaewon Lee,Yongwoo Kim,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses 'superficial forgetting,' where machine unlearning methods achieve logit forgetting but retain information in intermediate representations. The proposed Erase at the Core (EC) framework enforces forgetting throughout network hierarchies using multi-layer contrastive learning and deeply supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most unlearning methods alter only the final classifier and fail to effectively modify intermediate network representations, resulting in 'superficial forgetting.'

Method: EC framework uses multi-layer contrastive unlearning combined with deeply supervised learning, incorporating auxiliary modules and supervised loss functions at intermediate layers to enhance forgetting throughout the network hierarchy.

Result: EC achieves effective logit-level forgetting, reduces representational similarity to the original model, and is compatible with existing unlearning methods while retaining performance on retain sets.

Conclusion: The EC framework improves representation-level forgetting and can be integrated into current methods, demonstrating its value for deeper, model-agnostic unlearning.

Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.

*Yawei Li,Benjamin Bergner,Yinghan Zhao,Vihang Prakash Patil,Bei Chen,Cheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method, optimizes reasoning efficiency in large reasoning models (LRMs) by learning a complete transformation, outperforming linear methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency caused by verbose outputs in large reasoning models (LRMs) and improve reasoning compactness beyond linear adjustments.

Method: FlowSteer employs nonlinear transformations using Flow Matching to control verbose vs. concise reasoning, leveraging input-dependent velocity fields for precise representation shifts.

Result: FlowSteer achieves superior task performance and token efficiency over existing inference-time methods across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Nonlinear generative techniques like FlowSteer provide a more effective way to control reasoning processes in LRMs than conventional linear methods.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

*Shunya Nagashima,Shuntaro Suzuki,Shuitsu Koyama,Shinnosuke Hirano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DecompSSM, a method addressing MTS forecasting challenges using a parallel deep state space model framework, improving component-wise modeling and context sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome difficulties in MTS forecasting by addressing entangled components and underutilized shared structures across variables in dynamic real-world data.

Method: DecompSSM utilizes three parallel deep state space branches to separately model trends, seasonality, and residuals, incorporating adaptive temporal scales, cross-variable context refinement, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss.

Result: DecompSSM surpassed existing methods on benchmarks like ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04, showcasing its effectiveness in MTS forecasting.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that component-wise modeling combined with global context refinement can enhance MTS forecasting performance significantly.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for decision-making in domains such as weather, energy, and finance. It remains challenging because real-world sequences intertwine slow trends, multi-rate seasonalities, and irregular residuals. Existing methods often rely on rigid, hand-crafted decompositions or generic end-to-end architectures that entangle components and underuse structure shared across variables. To address these limitations, we propose DecompSSM, an end-to-end decomposition framework using three parallel deep state space model branches to capture trend, seasonal, and residual components. The model features adaptive temporal scales via an input-dependent predictor, a refinement module for shared cross-variable context, and an auxiliary loss that enforces reconstruction and orthogonality. Across standard benchmarks (ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04), DecompSSM outperformed strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness of combining component-wise deep state space models and global context refinement.

*Wei Soon Cheong,Lian Lian Jiang,Jamie Ng Suat Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of time-series foundation models versus a baseline LSTM for electricity demand forecasting across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to examine whether time-series foundation models can efficiently utilize exogenous features for forecasting electricity demand, which is crucial for the energy domain.

Method: The authors systematically tested various foundation models (MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2) and a baseline LSTM across different datasets (Singaporean and Australian markets) and feature configurations.

Result: Chronos-2 performed best among foundation models in zero-shot settings, but the LSTM baseline often surpassed foundation models in stable climatic conditions like Singapore, especially for short-term forecasting.

Conclusion: Domain-specific considerations, including model architectures and geographic contexts, play a vital role in forecasting effectiveness rather than universally relying on foundation models.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

### [350] [Robust Federated Learning via Byzantine Filtering over Encrypted Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05410)
*Adda Akram Bendoukha,Aymen Boudguiga,Nesrine Kaaniche,Renaud Sirdey,Didem Demirag,Sébastien Gambs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach combining homomorphic encryption and meta-classifiers for privacy-preserving and Byzantine-resilient federated learning, demonstrating effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces privacy and security challenges due to inference attacks and Byzantine behaviors, and there is a lack of a unified framework addressing these two challenges simultaneously.

Method: The authors propose a combination of homomorphic encryption for secure aggregation and meta-classifiers trained on shadow updates to filter Byzantine behaviors, alongside an automated hyperparameter selection for the CKKS cryptosystem.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks like FEMNIST and CIFAR10 show high accuracy (90%-94%) for identifying Byzantine updates, with minimal model utility loss and reasonable encrypted inference runtimes between 6 to 26 seconds.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances privacy, security, and resilience against Byzantine attacks in federated learning, combining privacy-preserving techniques and robust filtering strategies with practical efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

*Sheshansh Agrawal,Thien Hang Nguyen,Douwe Kiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tournament graph framework for efficient $k$-wise reranking using large language models, achieving high accuracy and efficiency across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reranking methods either inefficiently utilize ranking information or rely on suboptimal heuristics, necessitating a more structured and effective approach.

Method: The authors propose a tournament graph framework where $k$-document comparisons produce pairwise preferences, aggregated into a global preference graph that efficiently identifies top-ranking items, manages cycles, and ensures tiered rankings.

Result: Across 14 benchmarks with 5 LLMs, the method achieves superior accuracy while reducing token usage by 25-40% compared to similar approaches and 7x fewer than pairwise reranking methods at comparable quality.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled and efficient solution for $k$-wise reranking tasks, leveraging global preferences to deliver robust and resource-saving rankings.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces REAL, a reinforcement learning framework focusing on treating verifiable rewards as labels, which improves upon existing methods such as GRPO and DAPO with better training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR approaches suffer from gradient misassignment and domination issues during policy updates, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. The authors aim to resolve these limitations to further enhance reasoning tasks with large language models.

Method: The proposed REAL framework reformulates policy optimization into a classification task by treating verifiable rewards as categorical labels. Additionally, it employs anchor logits to enhance learning efficiency, ensuring balanced gradient allocation.

Result: REAL outperformed GRPO and DAPO across experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, with a significant average Pass@1 improvement of up to 6.7% on a 1.5B model. Gains consistently scaled with larger models, including the 7B model.

Conclusion: The REAL framework achieves stable training and superior performance in reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in comparison to state-of-the-art methods like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

*Jan Malte Töpperwien,Aditya Mohan,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep RL, focusing on offline goal-conditioned RL under varied regimes. It finds hyperparameter sensitivity is not inherent but amplified by bootstrapping dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify if hyperparameter sensitivity in RL is intrinsic to the RL problem or influenced by specific training mechanisms, particularly in offline goal-conditioned RL.

Method: The study involves offline goal-conditioned RL with fixed data distributions, examining effects of stationary and non-stationary data quality regimes. Two algorithms, HIQL and QRL, are analyzed for robustness.

Result: It finds QRL is robust with stable near-optimal regions with modest expert data, while HIQL shows sharp, unstable hyperparameter sensitivity. Gradient alignment diagnostics identify stronger destructive interference in bootstrapped objectives leading to sensitivity.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter sensitivity is not inherently unavoidable in RL but is amplified due to bootstrapping dynamics, suggesting potential improvements in algorithm design for robustness.

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

### [354] [Thermodynamic Limits of Physical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05463)
*Koichi Takahashi,Yusuke Hayashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract introduces two metrics, Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule and Empowerment per Joule, to measure the physical efficiency of AI intelligence in terms of energy utilization. It ties these concepts to principles in stochastic thermodynamics and provides methods to align and benchmark energy efficiency in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address and measure the substantial energy consumption of advanced AI systems while connecting intelligence to physical and energy efficiency.

Method: The authors propose two complementary metrics (Thermodynamic Epiplexity and Empowerment per Joule) under defined thermodynamic assumptions and subsystem boundaries. They use principles from stochastic thermodynamics as a framework to develop and test these ideas while proposing a unified reporting structure.

Result: They clarify how energy costs can be benchmarked using Landauer-scale efficiencies, and they propose practical guidance using MDL (Minimum Description Length) for empirical settings to measure and report these metrics accurately alongside boundary and energy conventions.

Conclusion: The paper offers a dual-metric framework to evaluate AI system efficiency, emphasizing clarity in energy use, consistency in computation comparisons, and connections to energy-scale analyses. This framework aims to reduce ambiguity and support decision-making in energy-efficient AI design.

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified clipping framework for Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) methods, analyzing how policy divergence measures affect performance and proposing the KL3 estimator for improved exploration and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the training stability and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through improved policy divergence constraints in RLVR methods.

Method: The method involves developing a unified clipping framework that generalizes existing approaches like GRPO, using a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator, KL3, to constrain policy divergence effectively.

Result: Empirical results show that integrating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves stability and performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating the KL3-based policy divergence constraint enhances RLVR methods by promoting better exploration and consistent policy optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

*Tao Huang,Rui Wang,Xiaofei Liu,Yi Qin,Li Duan,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ) as a method to detect misbehaviors in large vision-language models (LVLMs), addressing issues like hallucinations and adversarial vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models often produce unreliable outputs when faced with adversarial or unclear inputs, raising concerns about their deployment in critical applications.

Method: The paper proposes a fine-grained Evidential Uncertainty Quantification method using Evidence Theory to model conflicts and knowledge gaps, analyzing supporting and opposing evidence from model output features in a single pass.

Result: EUQ significantly outperforms existing baselines in identifying misbehaviors like hallucinations and out-of-distribution failures, providing granular insights into internal model conflicts and ignorance.

Conclusion: EUQ offers an effective tool for detecting and interpreting misbehaviors in LVLMs, enhancing their reliability for deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE) to improve exploration and difficulty adaptation in Reinforcement Learning frameworks, addressing inefficiencies in current GRPO-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO face challenges in exploration and adapting difficulty, rooted in the symmetric advantage estimation inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE).

Method: The authors propose A-GRAE, an algorithm that asymmetrically adjusts advantage weights for better exploration and employs a curriculum-like approach to prioritize simpler samples initially.

Result: Experiments on seven benchmarks show A-GRAE enhances the performance of GRPO and its variants for LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: A-GRAE provides a robust solution to exploration and difficulty adaptation bottlenecks, improving reinforcement learning frameworks' efficiency through asymmetric advantage estimation and dynamic sample modulation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DLM-Scope, a sparse autoencoder-based framework for interpreting diffusion language models (DLMs), showing its potential to reduce loss, enable effective interventions, and establish a basis for mechanistic interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to develop mechanistic interpretability tools for diffusion language models (DLMs), as DLMs emerge as promising alternatives to autoregressive large language models (LLMs).

Method: The paper proposes and implements DLM-Scope, based on Top-K sparse autoencoders (SAEs), to extract interpretable features and assess their effect on DLM behavior and loss.

Result: DLM-Scope shows that SAE insertion improves interpretability and reduces cross-entropy loss in DLMs, particularly in early layers. SAE features enhance diffusion-time interventions and provide decoding and stability signals during post-training.

Conclusion: The findings support the application of sparse autoencoders to diffusion language models, paving the way for enhanced interpretability tools and demonstrating their promise in diverse DLM tasks and algorithms.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

TL;DR: LOGDIFF provides a logical guidance framework for diffusion models to achieve constrained generation using complex logical expressions at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable principled, constrained generation in diffusion models with complex logical expressions through logical guidance.

Method: The paper derives a Boolean calculus for exact logical guidance and introduces hybrid guidance using atomic scores and posterior probabilities. It employs a recursive algorithm to compute guidance signals from conditionally independent or mutually exclusive subformulas.

Result: LOGDIFF is effective in tasks such as image and protein structure generation while maintaining logical constraints.

Conclusion: Exact logical guidance in diffusion models is practically achievable and broadly applicable to logical and conditional generation tasks using the methods proposed in the LOGDIFF framework.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method called message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which improves task-specific adaptations in pre-trained graph neural networks by injecting learnable prompts into the message passing process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies the challenge of adapting pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks due to mismatches in pre-training objectives and task-specific requirements.

Method: The authors introduce a method to inject learnable prompts into the message passing step of GNNs to reweight neighbor messages and incorporate task-specific vectors, while leaving the backbone GNN architecture frozen.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms prior graph prompting techniques in few-shot tasks and performs competitively against fine-tuning methods in full-shot settings.

Conclusion: Message-adaptive graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient and effective solution for adapting pre-trained GNNs to diverse downstream tasks, showcasing its compatibility with various backbones and pre-training schemes.

Abstract: Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) transfer well, but adapting them to downstream tasks remains challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces KernelGYM, a robust GPU environment for kernel generation training, and Dr.Kernel-14B, an RL-based model that achieves competitive performance in kernel generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable large language models to generate high-quality kernel code for scalable AI systems, overcoming issues in training such as reward hacking and lazy optimization.

Method: The paper develops KernelGYM, a training environment, and proposes TRLOO for unbiased RL advantage estimation, along with Profiling-based Rewards and Rejection Sampling for stability.

Result: Dr.Kernel-14B achieves competitive results in Kernelbench, outperforming Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-5 in kernel code generation with significant speedup rates.

Conclusion: Dr.Kernel-14B demonstrates the feasibility of training LLMs for efficient kernel code generation, providing benchmarks and resources for further research.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

*Rishabh Bhattacharya,Naresh Manwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EdgeMask-DG and its extension, EdgeMask-DG*, to address domain generalization challenges in graph neural networks using adversarial masking. These methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks face difficulties with structural shifts across domains due to varying graph topologies, and existing solutions fail to pinpoint domain-invariant edges effectively.

Method: The authors propose EdgeMask-DG, employing a min-max algorithm where an edge masker imposes adversarial masks, and EdgeMask-DG*, which enriches graphs with feature-derived edges to enhance domain generalization.

Result: EdgeMask-DG* demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, notably improving the worst-case domain accuracy on Cora OOD to 78.0%, a +3.8 pp improvement.

Conclusion: The robust optimization approach and incorporation of adversarial and enriched graph structures make EdgeMask-DG* a breakthrough in graph neural network domain generalization.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

TL;DR: This paper introduces DFPO, a distributional RL framework optimizing value modeling and stability under noisy real-world conditions, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training RL systems in real-world environments, such as noisy supervision and poor generalization, especially in post-training of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The paper introduces DFPO, which improves value modeling by learning a value flow field rather than independent quantile predictions. It also incorporates conditional risk control and consistency constraints to handle noisy feedback.

Result: DFPO achieves better training stability and generalization in various tasks like dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific challenges, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including PPO and FlowRL.

Conclusion: DFPO provides enhanced robustness and fine-grained value modeling for RL systems, proving effective under noisy conditions and achieving superior results across multiple domains.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

*Yikuan Zhang,Ning Yang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the relationship between the noise covariance matrix and Hessian in SGD optimization, challenging prior assumptions and presenting a general formulation of this relationship relevant for deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the relationship between SGD noise covariance and the Hessian matrix, and address misconceptions about their equivalence in deep neural networks.

Method: Utilize the Activity--Weight Duality concept to derive a general formulation of the relationship between noise covariance and curvature and validate it through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Result: The study shows that the noise covariance matrix and Hessian commute approximately, not coincide exactly, with their diagonal elements following a bounded power-law relation validated experimentally.

Conclusion: Provides a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning, challenging prior restricted assumptions on the connection between noise and curvature in SGD.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shiva-DiT addresses computational inefficiencies in Diffusion Transformers using a novel pruning method that balances learnability and hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers face high computational costs due to self-attention's quadratic scaling, and existing pruning methods struggle to meet learnability and efficiency requirements under strict hardware limits.

Method: Shiva-DiT employs Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection with deterministic token counts and residual gradient estimation for end-to-end learnability. It also integrates a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy for dynamic pruning.

Result: Shiva-DiT achieves a 1.54× wall-clock speedup and surpasses existing baselines in fidelity, eliminating tensor overheads.

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT establishes itself as a new benchmark for efficiency and fidelity in Diffusion Transformer pruning, optimizing hardware performance while maintaining high model accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

*Xuhui Li,Zhengquan Luo,Xiwei Liu,Yongqiang Yu,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGFM offers a faster algorithm for generative distillation using a flow matching framework, achieving high efficiency and competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods face inefficiencies due to reliance on heuristic guidance and trajectory instability, hampering downstream generalization and performance under strong constraints or low IPC.

Method: PGFM uses a flow matching-based approach in the latent space of a frozen VAE, with a novel path-to-prototype guidance mechanism for deterministic synthesis.

Result: PGFM achieves improved efficiency (7.6 times faster) and competitive performance compared to diffusion-based methods, with increased mode coverage of 78%.

Conclusion: PGFM introduces a practical and efficient alternative for dataset distillation, demonstrating its capability to overcome limitations seen in previous methods.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

TL;DR: The paper addresses instability in reinforcement learning due to mode-dependent layers like Batch Normalization used in PPO, proposing a rectification strategy (MDR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mode-dependent layers' discrepancies during training and evaluation adversely impact reinforcement learning stability and performance.

Method: Introduced Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a dual-phase training method to stabilize PPO using mode-dependent layers.

Result: Experiments showed MDR improves stability and performance across diverse tasks and accommodates various mode-dependent layers.

Conclusion: MDR mitigates instabilities caused by mode-dependent components, boosting performance in reinforcement-learning tasks without altering architectures.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

*Ojasva Nema,Kaustubh Sharma,Aditya Chauhan,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bilinear MLPs with explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural bias to improve structural disentanglement in neural networks, enabling reliable unlearning and better long-term generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks struggle with selective unlearning and long-term extrapolation, even for tasks with algebraic structure, due to internal representational limitations during training.

Method: The authors propose using Bilinear MLP architectures that introduce multiplicative interactions for structural disentanglement. They analytically prove these architectures ensure `non-mixing' of components under gradient flow, validated through various controlled experiments.

Result: Bilinear MLPs outperform traditional networks (pointwise nonlinear) by recovering true operators aligned with algebraic structures in tasks like modular arithmetic, Lie group dynamics, and selective unlearning.

Conclusion: Architectural design, such as multiplicative interactions, is critical for enhancing model editability and generalization, enabling more robust unlearning in neural networks.

Abstract: Selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation remain fragile in modern neural networks, even when tasks have underlying algebraic structure. In this work, we argue that these failures arise not solely from optimization or unlearning algorithms, but from how models structure their internal representations during training. We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning.

TL;DR: This paper explores the lack of multimodal approaches in time series foundation models. It introduces a novel multimodal pretraining framework and dataset to enhance time series understanding, alongside HORAI, a new model achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series foundation models heavily depend on unimodal data, which limits their effectiveness. There is a need to incorporate complementary modalities to improve time series understanding and generalization across different domains.

Method: The authors propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm leveraging endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news). A new dataset (MM-TS) is created, and a model named HORAI is developed with specialized components to fuse multimodal features effectively.

Result: HORAI, pretrained on the MM-TS dataset, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on tasks like time series forecasting and anomaly detection, evidencing its enhanced generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper marks significant progress in developing multimodal foundation models for time series analysis, filling critical gaps in data integration, and delivering superior performance on key time series tasks.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in tabular foundation models using transformers by introducing TACO, a latent space compression method, which significantly reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of computational complexity and inefficiency in current tabular foundation models during training and inference due to their reliance on attention mechanisms.

Method: Developed TACO, an end-to-end compression model for tabular data that compresses datasets into latent space for faster processing and lower memory consumption.

Result: TACO achieved up to 94x faster inference and consumed up to 97% less memory compared to state-of-the-art transformer architectures, while maintaining competitive performance on the TabArena benchmark.

Conclusion: TACO provides an efficient solution for handling large-scale tabular datasets by drastically improving scalability and computational efficiency without performance loss.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

### [372] [Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656)
*Igor Santos-Grueiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formalizes the challenges in inferring alignment in large language models (LLMs) from observed behaviors, demonstrating that observed compliance in behavioral evaluations does not necessarily indicate latent alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to critically analyze the dominant reliance on behavioral evaluations for assessing alignment in LLMs and to introduce a formal framework for studying potential inference issues in this paradigm.

Method: The paper uses a formal theoretical approach, introducing the "Alignment Verifiability Problem" and the concept of "Normative Indistinguishability" to frame alignment as an identifiability issue under partial observability and evaluation-aware agents.

Result: The authors prove that finite behavioral evaluations cannot uniquely identify underlying alignment properties in agents, even in idealized scenarios. Behavioral tests provide partial, not definitive, information on alignment.

Conclusion: Alignment evaluations should be viewed as tools to bound observable compliance rather than definitive tests of latent alignment. Current benchmarks are insufficient to certify alignment, reframing their utility as estimative rather than certifying.

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the long-term tail behavior of gradient norm-squared in SGD and clipped SGD using large deviations theory, uncovering faster tail decay rates than previously established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding long-term tail decay behavior of SGD methods, providing stronger guarantees for modern machine learning models trained for millions of iterations.

Method: Utilizing large deviations theory to analyze the long-term tail decay of SGD and clipped SGD under different noise assumptions.

Result: The paper establishes tighter upper and lower bounds on long-term tail decay rates for SGD and c-SGD, with exponentially faster rates than prior finite-time-based analyses.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of SGD tail decay, offering improved long-term guarantees for training deep learning models.

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

Result: Evaluation over 30 years of PV generation data from 259 European regions shows the proposed method improves forecast accuracy, calibration, and interval quality compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The AQ-RNN framework is effective for uncertainty-aware energy management in renewable energy systems, offering calibrated predictions and enhanced robustness across regions.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.

### [375] [Accelerating Benchmarking of Functional Connectivity Modeling via Structure-aware Core-set Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05667)
*Ling Zhan,Zhen Li,Junjie Huang,Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research introduces a novel framework, SCLCS, to select small, representative subsets of data for benchmarking functional connectivity modeling methods in large-scale fMRI datasets, achieving high ranking consistency with significantly reduced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational bottleneck in evaluating numerous functional connectivity modeling methods due to the vast amount of possible model-data pairings, which has prevented routine large-scale operator assessments in neuroscience.

Method: The proposed SCLCS framework leverages an adaptive Transformer to learn unique FC structures and uses a Structural Perturbation Score for stability assessment. A density-balanced sampling ensures the core-set is structurally robust and diverse, effectively maintaining ranking accuracy with minimal data.

Result: SCLCS preserved ground-truth model ranking with only 10% of the dataset, improving ranking consistency by up to 23.2% compared to state-of-the-art core-set selection methods, validated on the REST-meta-MDD dataset.

Conclusion: This work provides the first formalized approach to core-set selection for functional connectivity operator benchmarking, enabling efficient, accurate, and computationally feasible assessments in computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

### [376] [Stable but Wrong: When More Data Degrades Scientific Conclusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05668)
*Zhipeng Zhang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Increasing data size in observational studies doesn't always improve reliability; it can enhance systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that accumulating more data inherently leads to more reliable scientific conclusions.

Method: Synthetic experiments to illustrate errors, stability, and incorrect convergence in observational datasets.

Result: Revealed that standard inference can systematically converge to false conclusions despite calibration and diagnostic checks.

Conclusion: Inference must be governed by explicit integrity checks in data collection, beyond availability of data itself.

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

*Miriam Schäfers,Merlijn Krale,Thiago D. Simão,Nils Jansen,Maximilian Weininger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs (PBP) that integrates a perception model to manage high-dimensional observation spaces in partially observable Markov decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers for POMDPs struggle with high-dimensional observations like camera images, making real-world applications intractable.

Method: The paper proposes the PBP framework, which employs a perception model (an image classifier) to map high-dimensional observations into probability distributions over states and integrates this into belief updates. It also incorporates uncertainty quantification to enhance robustness.

Result: The PBP framework is implemented with two traditional POMDP solvers. Empirical results show that PBP outperforms end-to-end deep reinforcement learning methods and improves robustness against visual corruption via uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The PBP framework effectively resolves the challenge of high-dimensional observations in POMDPs, making it more feasible for real-world applications and ensuring robustness through uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

*Alex Vitvitskyi,Michael Boratko,Matej Grcic,Razvan Pascanu,Deep Shah,Petar Veličković*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates leveraging evolutionary search methods, specifically AlphaEvolve, to discover novel activation functions that improve optimization and encode desired inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting optimal activation functions which impact optimization and inductive biases of architectures, while exploring automated discovery using evolutionary search.

Method: Utilizing AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary search framework that employs frontier large language models as mutators to explore flexible search spaces, focusing on performance and inductive biases by evaluating on out-of-distribution data.

Result: Empirical experiments demonstrate that small-scale synthetic datasets are sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover useful activation functions.

Conclusion: Evolutionary search frameworks like AlphaEvolve offer an efficient and flexible approach to finding activation functions that not only enhance performance but also align with specified inductive biases.

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

*Rachel S. Y. Teo,P. N. Karthik,Ramya Korlakai Vinayak,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for clustering items into groups using actively collected noisy responses with theoretical lower bounds and an optimal algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To devise an efficient clustering methodology that works with noisy pairwise feedback while minimizing the number of required queries.

Method: The authors use a change-of-measure technique to derive theoretical lower bounds and propose an algorithm leveraging a Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic with an empirical variant for computational feasibility.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to the theoretical lower bounds, with empirical evidence demonstrating minimal deviation.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a near-optimal, efficient solution to the problem of clustering items under noisy observation constraints.

Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.

### [380] [Fix Representation (Optimally) Before Fairness: Finite-Sample Shrinkage Population Correction and the True Price of Fairness Under Subpopulation Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05707)
*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the tension between predictive accuracy and fairness constraints in machine learning, identifying they can be artifacts of misrepresented subgroup proportions in training data, while proposing an evaluation protocol to pinpoint genuine tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the paradox where fairness interventions in machine learning sometimes improve accuracy and to provide clarity on evaluating fairness versus accuracy tradeoffs, particularly under subpopulation shifts.

Method: The paper derives a theoretical framework showing the effects of subgroup proportion misrepresentation in training data. It introduces 'shrinkage reweighting,' a method to optimally interpolate between target and training mixtures. Additionally, it proposes an evaluation protocol to isolate fairness-utility tradeoffs by fixing representation before applying fairness interventions.

Result: The paper demonstrates, through theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data and real-world datasets (Adult, COMPAS), that its proposed protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs and reveals the actual fairness-utility frontier.

Conclusion: Fairness interventions might misleadingly appear to aid accuracy due to improperly weighted baselines. Correcting subgroup proportion misrepresentations with the proposed protocol ensures a clearer understanding of fairness-utility tradeoffs.

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairBoost modifies boosting algorithms to incorporate group fairness by projecting distributions onto fairness constraints while maintaining theoretical training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring group fairness in boosting algorithms while maintaining identifiable and predictable training dynamics.

Method: FairBoost modifies the training distribution through projection onto fairness-constrained sets and adjusts the exponential-weights distribution while calculating a fairness cost.

Result: FairBoost provides a loss bound with convergence rates affected by the fairness cost, demonstrating practical competitive tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy.

Conclusion: FairBoost successfully incorporates fairness constraints into boosting algorithms, balancing accuracy and fairness with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $δ_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.

TL;DR: CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings viable, preserving quality and dramatically improving efficiency for text and vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of high-dimensional dense embeddings in storage, memory, and inference latency, and improve the sparse embedding technique CSR.

Method: CSRv2 introduces progressive k-annealing for stability, supervised contrastive objectives for quality, and full backbone finetuning for adaptability.

Result: CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20%, achieves better performance than CSR and MRL with fewer active features, and offers massive improvements in compute and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: CSRv2 extends the practicality and efficiency of ultra-sparse embeddings without performance compromises, enabling broader applications in real-time and edge-deployable AI systems.

Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

Motivation: Address the limitation of existing methods that rely on human-crafted prompts, aiming for scalable and automated prompt injection attacks against LLM agents.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework (AutoInject) generates adversarial suffixes optimized for attack success and utility preservation, supports black-box optimization and transfer attacks.

Result: AutoInject compromises frontier models (GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash) on benchmark using a 1.5B parameter adversarial generator.

Conclusion: AutoInject establishes a new and stronger baseline for prompt injection vulnerabilities, advancing automated attacks on LLM agents.

Abstract: Prompt injection is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents; yet, effective automated attacks remain largely unexplored from an optimization perspective. Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

TL;DR: This study questions if deep clustering techniques like DEC truly overcome $k$-means' limitations, especially in discovering diverse clusters, arguing that non-deep learning methods might perform better through distributional insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether deep clustering methods, specifically DEC, effectively address the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, such as recognizing clusters with arbitrary shapes, sizes, and densities.

Method: The paper examines DEC’s functionality, compares it to $k$-means, and evaluates its ability to overcome clustering limitations by leveraging learned latent representations.

Result: The study reveals that DEC and similar deep clustering methods fail to fully exploit data distribution, limiting their capability to address $k$-means' inherent issues.

Conclusion: Non-deep learning approaches utilizing distributional properties of data may better address clustering challenges compared to deep clustering methods like DEC.

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD) accelerates inference for (M)LLMs by optimizing draft paths through variational training to enhance decoding efficiency, yielding up to 9.6% speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods face limitations due to training-decoding discrepancy as they optimize single trajectories but require ranking and verifying multiple paths during inference.

Method: VSD formulates draft training as variational inference, maximizing target-model acceptance probability using ELBO. It employs Expectation-Maximization, MCMC sampling, Adaptive Rejection Weighting, and Confidence-Aware Regularization to ensure quality and efficiency.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows VSD improves acceptance length and speed, while experiments demonstrate up to 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec in decoding efficiency.

Conclusion: VSD enhances inference efficiency for (M)LLMs by addressing training-decoding discrepancies and optimizing draft paths using advanced probabilistic methods, yielding faster and more effective decoding.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Selective Transition Correction (STC) for cross-domain offline reinforcement learning, aiming to leverage mismatched source domain data by correcting actions and rewards to align with target domain dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in adapting policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning, enabling the use of offline datasets from similar but different source domains to enhance policy performance.

Method: The paper introduces the STC algorithm, which employs an inverse policy model and a reward model to modify source domain actions and rewards to align with the target domain dynamics, and a forward dynamics model to filter samples for better target alignment.

Result: The proposed STC algorithm outperforms existing baselines in experiments conducted across various environments with dynamics mismatches.

Conclusion: STC effectively enables reliable policy adaptation by leveraging source domain data, demonstrating superior performance and better utilizing valuable but mismatched datasets in cross-domain offline RL.

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

TL;DR: The study explores utilizing Gaussian process variances in combination with sparse activations in deep neural networks (DNNs) to enhance training stability and expressivity, showcasing promising energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training and energy efficiency of deep neural networks by leveraging sparsity in activations and understanding the role of Gaussian process variances.

Method: Investigated the covariance matrix of Gaussian processes at initialization, combined with sparsity-inducing activation functions like clipped ReLU, to test their effect on high sparsity levels (up to 90%) in DNNs and CNNs.

Result: Larger fixed Gaussian process variances improve expressivity and training stability even at high sparsity levels, achieving full or near-full accuracy in hidden layers.

Conclusion: Focusing on Gaussian process variances helps maintain model performance while enabling energy-efficient sparse layer designs for machine learning models.

Abstract: The intermediate layers of deep networks can be characterised as a Gaussian process, in particular the Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy prescribes the limiting covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\text{CReLU}_{τ,m}(x)=\min(\max(x-τ,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to generalize the Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse to non-linear systems, especially for neural networks, enabling tractable solutions for complex inverse problems.

Method: The paper defines Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN) and introduces Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP) to ensure consistency constraints in nonlinear mappings.

Result: SPNN expands zero-shot inverse problem solving to nonlinear degradations, enabling inversion for distortions and semantic abstractions while controlling generative outputs through diffusion-based processes.

Conclusion: SPNN provides a practical framework for solving non-linear inverse problems, enhancing applications in generative outputs control and inversion without retraining diffusion priors.

Abstract: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or "Back-Projection", $x' = x + A^\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, "degradation" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.

*Shutong Ding,Yimiao Zhou,Ke Hu,Mokai Pan,Shan Zhong,Yanwei Fu,Jingya Wang,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that employs diffusion bridge critics, improving value distribution modeling and addressing discretization errors, demonstrating superior performance on continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RL methods emphasize diffusion policies but overlook diffusion critics, despite the fact that accurate critic modeling is critical for effective policy optimization, particularly in stochastic RL tasks.

Method: The authors propose Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC), a method that models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Q values using a diffusion model. DBC addresses discretization errors via an analytic integral formula and can be integrated into most RL frameworks.

Result: Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks show that DBC outperforms previous distributional critic models, demonstrating its efficacy and superiority.

Conclusion: DBC significantly enhances value estimation by leveraging diffusion bridge models for critics, making a notable contribution to reinforcement learning by improving the modeling of value distributions and integrating seamlessly into existing frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

*Prakhar Kaushik,Ankit Vaidya,Shravan Chaudhari,Rama Chellappa,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Share, a parameter-efficient continual learning method utilizing a shared low-rank subspace for task adaptation, achieving massive reductions in parameters and memory while ensuring knowledge integration and minimal interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient continual learning for large pretrained models is essential for real-world deployments but faces challenges like catastrophic forgetting and high retraining costs.

Method: A parameter-efficient finetuning approach, Share, dynamically builds and updates a single shared low-rank subspace to integrate knowledge from past and new tasks without data replay or multiple adapters.

Result: Share achieves significant improvements in scalability and efficiency, offering up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings compared to traditional methods, while maintaining comparable performance levels.

Conclusion: Share is a scalable and effective solution for continual learning in large AI systems, addressing catastrophic forgetting and inefficiency issues through dynamic low-rank subspace adaptation.

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

### [391] [Classification Under Local Differential Privacy with Model Reversal and Model Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05797)
*Caihong Qin,Yang Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the reduced data utility problem in local differential privacy (LDP) by treating it as a transfer learning issue, proposing methods to improve classification accuracy under LDP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of utility degradation caused by noise in local differential privacy while preserving its privacy guarantees.

Method: This paper introduces three techniques: a binary feedback mechanism for estimating dataset utility, model reversal to adapt underperforming classifiers, and model averaging based on utility estimates.

Result: Theoretical excess risk bounds were established under LDP, and experimental validation showed significant improvements in classification accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies successfully enhance classification performance under LDP, maintaining strong privacy guarantees without compromising data utility.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

### [392] [Bifrost: Steering Strategic Trajectories to Bridge Contextual Gaps for Self-Improving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05810)
*Quan M. Tran,Zhuo Huang,Wenbin Zhang,Bo Han,Koji Yatani,Masashi Sugiyama,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bifrost, a method allowing autonomous agents to reuse task trajectories effectively despite context shifts, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents face challenges in reusing successful task trajectories when switching contexts due to misalignments, leading to inefficiency in reasoning.

Method: The authors propose Bifrost, a training-free method that adapts previously solved trajectories to new tasks by leveraging context differences at the representation level using agent hidden states.

Result: Bifrost exhibits improvements over existing reuse and finetuning methods across diverse benchmarks, effectively enabling agents to utilize past experiences despite context shifts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that autonomous agents can enhance self-improvement by overcoming context mismatches through precise trajectory adaptation, offering a promising approach to efficient task reasoning.

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

*Artem Riabinin,Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Martin Takáč,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers, verifying the approach on large language model pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve learning rate scheduling for optimizers by making it adaptive and data-driven, addressing the inefficiency of manual tuning.

Method: A theoretical framework based on a generalized smoothness assumption is developed, leading to an adaptive warm-up scheduler that uses standard hyperparameters and determines durations automatically.

Result: The proposed adaptive warm-up selection is shown to outperform or match manually tuned warm-up schedules in LLaMA model pretraining without extra hyperparameter search.

Conclusion: The adaptive approach simplifies learning rate tuning, enhances performance, and is practically implementable across setups, with source code provided for accessibility.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

*Laura Plein,Alexi Turcotte,Arina Hallemans,Andreas Zeller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores generating synthetic datasets with similar statistical properties and utility to original datasets while safeguarding privacy, by indirect use of original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy risks in synthetic dataset generation and emulate statistical properties without compromising confidentiality.

Method: A test generator (fuzzer) creates data while a discriminator evolves samples to match original dataset properties, indirectly preserving constraints.

Result: Evaluated on four datasets, the approach achieved privacy preservation with synthetic data utility comparable to original datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates potential in maintaining privacy while providing high-utility synthetic datasets, surpassing current techniques in key aspects.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.

### [395] [Visualizing the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05849)
*Conor Rowan,Finn Murphy-Blanchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks, comparing different formulations and challenging the idea that their landscapes are complex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating why optimizers like SGD and ADAM work efficiently and extending loss landscape analysis to physics-informed machine learning.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive literature review and empirically examine loss landscapes using visualization techniques for physics-informed networks.

Result: Physics-informed neural loss landscapes exhibit smoothness, good conditioning, and convexity near solutions, with similar findings for Deep Ritz and strong form losses.

Conclusion: Loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks share properties with data-driven learning problems, potentially simplifying assumptions regarding their complexity.

Abstract: Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a "loss landscape" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.

*Minyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel score-based variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks, which overcomes common computational challenges and is scalable for large-scale networks like Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Bayesian neural networks using variational inference often encounter computational and scalability issues, limiting their application to large-scale models.

Method: The authors introduce a scalable variational inference method combining score matching loss and a proximal penalty term, allowing for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores and avoiding reparameterized sampling for broader variational families.

Result: This method demonstrates scalability and effectiveness on benchmarks such as visual recognition and time-series forecasting, using large-scale models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances Bayesian neural network inference by enabling practical scalability to large architectures while maintaining robustness and flexibility.

Abstract: Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.

### [397] [Escaping Local Minima Provably in Non-convex Matrix Sensing: A Deterministic Framework via Simulated Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05887)
*Tianqi Shen,Jinji Yang,Junze He,Kunhan Gao,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulated mechanism for escaping local minima in nonconvex optimization without computationally expensive tensor lifting, ensuring convergence to global optima in matrix sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix sensing optimization landscapes often contain spurious local minima, making global optimization difficult. Over-parameterization has been shown to improve optimization strategies, but it is computationally expensive, motivating exploration of alternatives.

Method: The paper proposes a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) mechanism that projects over-parameterized escape directions onto the original parameter space, enabling deterministic escape from local minima without explicit tensor lifting.

Result: The framework effectively escapes local minima and achieves convergence to global optima with minimal computational expense, backed by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This deterministic framework allows reliable escape from local minima, showcasing potential applications in broader nonconvex optimization problems while avoiding the computational cost of direct over-parameterization.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

*Han Li,Letian Zhu,Bohan Zhang,Rili Feng,Jiaming Wang,Yue Pan,Earl T. Barr,Sarro Federica,Zhaoyang Chu,He Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextBench, a tool for evaluating code context retrieval in coding agents during issue resolution tasks, demonstrating gaps in how agents use retrieved contexts and suggesting improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the limited evaluation of LLM-based coding agents, which focus mainly on task completion but do not assess how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving.

Method: The authors created ContextBench, a benchmark with 1,136 issue-resolution tasks, human-annotated gold contexts, and an automated evaluation framework to analyze context retrieval metrics (recall, precision, and efficiency).

Result: Evaluation of multiple LLMs and coding agents revealed that sophisticated scaffolding led to minimal improvements, LLMs emphasized recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between retrieved and utilized contexts during tasks.

Conclusion: ContextBench provides fine-grained intermediate metrics for assessing context retrieval, paving the way for better LLM reasoning in software tasks and highlighting inefficiencies in current methods.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks. Data and code are available at: https://cioutn.github.io/context-bench/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates transformer architecture capabilities, focusing on solving PARITY, presenting a more practical construction, and establishing a one-layer one-head transformer limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding transformer computational abilities, specifically for tasks like solving PARITY, and to create practically implementable solutions with realistic constraints.

Method: The paper proposes a novel transformer configuration with softmax, length-independent positional encoding, and no layernorm, demonstrating practical usability with or without causal masking.

Result: It introduces a new construction for solving PARITY that avoids impractical features and proves the impossibility of solving PARITY with a single-layer, single-head transformer.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of transformer limitations and presents a practical way to solve PARITY within feasible constraints, emphasizing the need for specific configurations.

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

*Seohyeon Cha,Huancheng Chen,Dongjun Kim,Haoran Zhang,Kevin Chan,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robust post-training quantization method for large language models (LLMs), enhancing inference efficiency through a regularized asymmetric calibration approach and a bounded search algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment challenges due to high memory and latency costs. Efficient inference methods like post-training quantization are crucial to maintaining robust performance while reducing computational overhead.

Method: The paper introduces a novel strategy combining symmetric and asymmetric calibration as regularization in PTQ. It also proposes a successive rounding procedure with bounded-search for trade-offs between quantization quality and computational cost.

Result: Their experiments on various LLMs, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks show improved perplexity and accuracy over existing PTQ methods, with controlled computational costs.

Conclusion: The proposed quantization framework enhances LLM efficiency while maintaining strong performance, providing a practical solution to deployment challenges through modest trade-offs in computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the soundness of generative sequence models using chess-based adversarial sequence generation and finds none of the models are fully sound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop tools that can verify the soundness of generative sequence models, particularly in capturing the true structure of domains like chess.

Method: The study uses adversarial sequence generation to test soundness, with adversaries generating valid sequences to elicit invalid predictions from sequence models. Chess models are trained on both random and high-quality game datasets under various techniques.

Result: The research shows that none of the chess sequence models are fully sound, though certain training techniques and datasets improve soundness. Board state probes largely do not causally influence token prediction.

Conclusion: Generative models struggle with maintaining soundness, but adversarial approaches and refined training techniques can help identify failure modes and improve performance.

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

*Seoirse Murray,Allison Qi,Timothy Qian,John Schulman,Collin Burns,Sara Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to identify and trace unintended model behaviors after post-training, caused by spurious correlations in diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training large language models on diverse datasets leads to unintended behaviors due to spurious correlations hidden within the data chunks.

Method: Developed SURF to identify runtime issues and TURF to trace them back to specific data sources causing the flawed behaviors.

Result: Demonstrated that current and open models experience miscalibrated behaviors due to imbalanced or underspecified training data chunks.

Conclusion: Chunky post-training introduces problematic behaviors; addressing these requires targeted tools to recognize and trace such issues for better model calibration.

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

*Zhenghao Xu,Qin Lu,Changlong Yu,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) in RL applications for training large language models (LLMs), proposing a practical approach called PMD-mean to address challenges in action space exploration by introducing adaptive regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in estimating partition function reliably during PMD updates for reinforcement learning in vast action spaces of LLMs, where limited rollouts and finite-sample issues create obstacles.

Method: The PMD-mean algorithm approximates the log-partition function using the mean reward under the sampling policy, with updates performed via regression in log-policy space. It implicitly applies adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularization during policy mirror descent.

Result: PMD-mean showed superior performance, stability, and computational efficiency in experiments on math reasoning tasks and demonstrated robustness against estimation errors.

Conclusion: PMD-mean enhances the practicality of PMD in RL for LLMs, offering stability and improved efficiency. The findings provide insights to refine RL algorithms for LLMs and extend understanding of PMD frameworks.

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

*Sudeepta Mondal,Xinyi Mary Xie,Ruxiao Duan,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of tuning out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors without relying on an ad hoc dataset deemed as OOD, which is often inaccessible or unrepresentative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detectors are often dependent on an external OOD dataset, but such datasets may be unavailable or unreliable. The inconsistency caused by varying performance on different chosen datasets motivates a new approach that avoids reliance on external data.

Method: The authors introduce a formalized problem of OOD detector tuning without additional OOD datasets, present strong baselines, and propose a new generic method that only uses the training dataset of the neural network for tuning.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms baseline methods in higher-parameter OOD detector families while maintaining comparative performance in lower-parameter families.

Conclusion: The study presents a robust alternative to tune OOD detectors without extra datasets, providing more reliable and accessible solutions for handling OOD detection.

Abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors are often tuned by a separate dataset deemed OOD with respect to the training distribution of a neural network (NN). OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns." Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets. We show that there can be significant variance in performance of detectors based on the adhoc dataset chosen in current literature, and thus even if such a dataset can be collected, the performance of the detector may be highly dependent on the choice. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the often neglected problem of tuning OOD detectors without a given ``OOD'' dataset. To this end, we present strong baselines as an attempt to approach this problem. Furthermore, we propose a new generic approach to OOD detector tuning that does not require any extra data other than those used to train the NN. We show that our approach improves over baseline methods consistently across higher-parameter OOD detector families, while being comparable across lower-parameter families.

Result: Methods demonstrate improved representation quality and classification accuracy on curved data spaces compared to traditional Euclidean approaches, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of utilizing geometry-aware dimensionality reduction techniques for better performance in machine learning and data science, specifically for manifold-constrained data.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

### [406] [Orthogonal Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05943)
*Sihan Yang,Kexuan Shi,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method for merging finetuned large language models while preserving their intrinsic geometric properties, using a Riemannian manifold approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional model merging methods that disrupt geometric properties by performing linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which hurts performance consistency.

Method: OrthoMerge operates on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group, using Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) matrices and an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy to separate and merge components of finetuned models based on geometric principles.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that OrthoMerge mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains model performance across various tasks, marking significant improvement over traditional merging approaches.

Conclusion: OrthoMerge provides a principled and effective method for model merging, promoting integration of diverse capabilities while retaining geometric integrity and improving task performance preservation.

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

### [407] [Breaking Symmetry Bottlenecks in GNN Readouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05950)
*Mouad Talhi,Arne Wolf,Anthea Monod*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph neural network limitations aren't solely due to message passing—readout stages also cause issues by erasing symmetry-aware components. A new readout design improves GNN expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the expressivity limitations of graph neural networks, specifically at the readout stage, which is often overlooked yet critical for retaining information related to graph structures.

Method: The authors use finite-dimensional representation theory to analyze linear readouts and propose projector-based invariant readouts that preserve symmetry-aware information while maintaining permutation invariance.

Result: The proposed readout methods enable fixed GNN encoders to distinguish WL-hard graph pairs and improve benchmark performance, highlighting the importance of readout design.

Conclusion: Readout design plays a critical role in GNN expressivity, and the authors' projector-based invariant method overcomes significant expressivity barriers.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven hybrid algorithm using LSTM networks and Random Forests for precise friction force estimation in hydraulic cylinders, achieving less than 10% error and 1.51 milliseconds computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve friction force modeling in hydraulic cylinders, addressing limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency of existing analytical models, for better precision under varying operational conditions.

Method: A hybrid algorithm based on LSTM networks and Random Forests is used for nonlinear friction force estimation. Training data were collected from experimental hydraulic setups, combining feature detection and estimation processes.

Result: The algorithm consistently delivers model errors under 10%, handles diverse conditions and variations, and operates at a low computational cost of 1.51 milliseconds, making it adaptable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method surpasses traditional models like LuGre by offering dynamic adaptability, high precision, and computational efficiency for real-time hydraulic applications, validated through experimental comparisons.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.

*Keith Ando Ogawa,Bruno Lopes Yamamoto,Lucas Lauton de Alcantara,Lucas Pellicer,Rosimeire Pereira Costa,Edson Bollis,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) by selectively fine-tuning only a few layers of the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing scale of LLMs makes previous fine-tuning methods inadequate due to computational and resource constraints. A more efficient solution is needed to minimize trainable parameters without compromising performance.

Method: The method involves systematic layer selection for fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or its variants. Layers are chosen based on their contribution to changes in internal representations using CKA (Centered Kernel Alignment) measurements.

Result: By selectively identifying the most impactful layers, the trainable parameters in LoRA techniques are reduced by up to 50%, with negligible or improved predictive performance on various benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method proves to be an effective alternative to fully fine-tuning all layers, maintaining competitive performance while achieving significant reductions in computational requirements across different model architectures and tasks.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

*Peter Holderrieth,Douglas Chen,Luca Eyring,Ishin Shah,Giri Anantharaman,Yutong He,Zeynep Akata,Tommi Jaakkola,Nicholas Matthew Boffi,Max Simchowitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Diamond Maps," a generative model designed to align with user preferences or constraints efficiently at inference time, providing high adaptability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow and diffusion models struggle with efficiently aligning generated outputs to user-defined rewards or constraints post-training. This inefficiency limits their practical applicability in dynamic or diverse scenarios.

Method: The authors propose "Diamond Maps," which are stochastic flow map models combining single-step sampling from flow maps with stochasticity to enable efficient reward alignment. The model leverages distillation from GLASS Flows and supports scalable computation methods like sequential Monte Carlo and guidance.

Result: Diamond Maps outperform existing methods in reward alignment tasks, exhibit efficient scalability, and can be learned effectively, demonstrating improved adaptability to preferences or constraints.

Conclusion: Diamond Maps pave the way for generative models capable of rapid adaptation to user-defined criteria during inference, addressing key limitations of current models in reward alignment.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

*Raj Ghugare,Michał Bortkiewicz,Alicja Ziarko,Benjamin Eysenbach*

TL;DR: This paper examines the role of compute power in reinforcement learning (RL) policies, showing that more compute enables solving complex and longer tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how the amount of computational resources influences reinforcement learning's performance and generalizability, as current RL frameworks lack a formal representation for this study.

Method: Formalized the concept of compute-bounded policies and proposed a minimal architecture capable of variable compute usage, supported by theoretical and experimental analysis.

Result: Findings show improved performance and better generalization on longer-horizon tasks when using increased compute resources across 31 task experiments.

Conclusion: Computational capacity positively impacts RL policy results and generalization without needing a proportional increase in model parameters.

Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational mechanisms behind how protein structure prediction models, specifically ESMFold, fold proteins.

Method: Analyzes ESMFold's folding process using counterfactual interventions on model latents. The analysis traces how biochemical signals and spatial features are represented across computational blocks.

Result: Discovered two stages in the folding trunk: early blocks handle biochemical initialization, while late blocks handle spatial and structural development.

Conclusion: The folding mechanisms of ESMFold can be localized, interpreted, and causally manipulated, shedding light on its prediction process.

Abstract: How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features such as charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop pairwise spatial features: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation. We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying structural decisions of ESMFold can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.

### [414] [Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens (CORAL): Transferrable and Calibration-Aware Inference-Time Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06022)
*Miranda Muqing Miao,Young-Min Cho,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORAL, an inference-time method that improves language model calibration and accuracy without retraining. It achieves up to 14% accuracy improvement and 49% calibration improvement across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show miscalibration issues, worsened after instruction tuning. Retraining to fix this is computationally expensive, requiring a lightweight alternative for improving calibration efficiently during inference.

Method: The authors propose CORAL, which uses regularized residual activations and weight-decay MLP probes to optimize correctness signals during inference without retraining.

Result: CORAL improved accuracy by 10% and expected calibration error by 50% on average for tested models. These improvements held across held-out benchmarks with gains of 14% in accuracy and 49% in calibration.

Conclusion: CORAL is a lightweight, effective method for improving calibration and performance of language models during inference, leveraging distributed signals in model internals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical guarantees for active inference (AIF), ensuring effective learning and decision-making under sufficient curiosity, and connects AIF to Bayesian frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address when AIF can balance curiosity to enable coherent learning and efficient decision-making, avoiding myopic exploitation and excessive exploration.

Method: The authors analytically establish guarantees for AIF by showing sufficient curiosity ensures Bayesian posterior consistency and bounded cumulative regret, connecting AIF to Bayesian experimental design and optimization.

Result: The study identifies conditions—such as sufficient curiosity, initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment—that ensure optimal learning and decision-making, and provides practical guidelines validated through real-world experiments.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between theory and practice in AIF, offering a theoretical foundation and actionable insights for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in complex tasks.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AP-OOD, a novel token-based aggregation method for OOD detection in natural language, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution detection is crucial for ensuring machine learning models function reliably, especially by improving how token embeddings are utilized for OOD scoring.

Method: AP-OOD leverages token-level information and interpolates between unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, utilizing both limited outlier data and aggregation beyond average pooling.

Result: AP-OOD significantly improves OOD detection performance by reducing false positive rates on text-based datasets, such as XSUM summarization and WMT15 En-Fr translation.

Conclusion: AP-OOD demonstrates superior OOD detection capability, showing the effectiveness of leveraging token-level information and semi-supervised flexibility in language models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

TL;DR: Pre-trained vision-language models struggle with physical intuition. Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning improve specific task performance but fail to generalize to unseen contexts or related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the physical reasoning abilities of pre-trained vision-language models, which lack strong intuitions about the physical world.

Method: The researchers trained vision-language models using reinforcement learning through interactive experiences with the environment, aiming to improve physical reasoning and generalization.

Result: Interactive learning improved performance on specific tasks but failed to generalize knowledge to related tasks or unseen contexts, even when visual and physical principles were shared.

Conclusion: Interaction-based learning alone is insufficient for endowing models with robust, generalizable physical intuitions. New methods are needed for better generalization.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of problem formulation and domain knowledge in black-box optimization for laminate composite structures, finding that a sequential approach yields better results compared to context-agnostic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding how problem formulation and domain knowledge affect outcomes in black-box optimization, especially in engineering tasks like topology optimization.

Method: The research involves a case study of a cantilever beam's topology optimization. It compares two strategies: concurrent optimization of all variables versus sequential optimization based on physical insights.

Result: Sequential optimization delivers superior and interpretable designs, while context-agnostic methods lead to suboptimal or non-physical results.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge into black-box optimization can enhance design outcomes, encouraging the creation of benchmarks that value context-aware strategies.

Abstract: Black-box optimization is increasingly used in engineering design problems where simulation-based evaluations are costly and gradients are unavailable. In this context, the optimization community has largely analyzed algorithm performance in context-free setups, while not enough attention has been devoted to how problem formulation and domain knowledge may affect the optimization outcomes. We address this gap through a case study in the topology optimization of laminated composite structures, formulated as a black-box optimization problem. Specifically, we consider the design of a cantilever beam under a volume constraint, intending to minimize compliance while optimizing both the structural topology and fiber orientations. To assess the impact of problem formulation, we explicitly separate topology and material design variables and compare two strategies: a concurrent approach that optimizes all variables simultaneously without leveraging physical insight, and a sequential approach that optimizes variables of the same nature in stages. Our results show that context-agnostic strategies consistently lead to suboptimal or non-physical designs. In contrast, the sequential strategy yields better-performing and more interpretable solutions. These findings underscore the value of incorporating, when available, domain knowledge into the optimization process and motivate the development of new black-box benchmarks that reward physically informed and context-aware optimization strategies.

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel local search method called VS-RLS, which adjusts stepsize dynamically during the optimization process to improve effectiveness in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has focused on continuous domains, with combinatorial optimization problems receiving limited attention. Existing methods using fixed neighbourhoods in local search approaches often get trapped in local optima, reducing exploration effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose Variable Stepsize Randomized Local Search (VS-RLS). This method dynamically adjusts stepsize, starting with exploratory wide searches and progressively focusing on fine-grained areas for better optimization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that VS-RLS outperforms traditional local search methods and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on diverse multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems.

Conclusion: VS-RLS offers an effective and generalizable approach to solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems by overcoming the limitations posed by fixed neighbourhood reliance in traditional methods.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has predominantly focused on continuous domains, with comparatively limited attention given to multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Combinatorial problems differ significantly from continuous ones in terms of problem structure and landscape. Recent studies have shown that on MOCOPs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can even be outperformed by simple randomised local search. Starting with a randomly sampled solution in search space, randomised local search iteratively draws a random solution (from an archive) to perform local variation within its neighbourhood. However, in most existing methods, the local variation relies on a fixed neighbourhood, which limits exploration and makes the search easy to get trapped in local optima. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective local search method, called variable stepsize randomized local search (VS-RLS), which adjusts the stepsize during the search. VS-RLS transitions gradually from a broad, exploratory search in the early phases to a more focused, fine-grained search as the search progresses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of VS-RLS through extensive evaluations against local search and MOEAs methods on diverse MOCOPs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an innovative training methodology for GPT models, aiming to improve model performance through automatic, evolutionary-style optimization while minimizing manual intervention where possible.

Method: A genetic algorithm-like approach is used, where independent GPT agents modify each other's training code. The best-performing models are selected for subsequent iterations. Persistent memory files and a HITL (human-in-the-loop) interface are also implemented to enable modifications and track improvements.

Result: DARWIN achieved a 1.26% improvement in model FLOPS utilization and a 2.07% improvement in perplexity after 5 iterations, showcasing the potential of evolutionary GPT training.

Conclusion: DARWIN demonstrates the feasibility of scaling GPT training through evolutionary techniques, marking a step toward automating and enhancing training pipelines in a cost-efficient way.

Abstract: DARWIN is an evolutionary GPT model, utilizing a genetic-algorithm like optimization structure with several independent GPT agents being trained individually using unique training code. Each iteration, the GPT models are prompted to modify the training code of one another in an attempt to improve their performance in a mutation-like manner, and the best GPT agents are then benchmarked and selected for the next iteration by genetic algorithm. For demonstration purposes and due to budget and time constraints, OpenAI API is used to prompt training code improvements and the nanoGPT framework is used as the training code. DARWIN also utilizes persistent JSON-based memory files to track previous reasoning and changes to code to correlate with improvement to model performance. and a bidirectional interface for HITL intervention allowing the model to request upgrades such as additional datasets, training scripts, and restructuring of file hierarchies. In experiments, DARWIN achieved a 1.26 percent improvement in model FLOPS utilization (MFU) and a 2.07 percent improvement to perplexity in 5 iterations of training over baseline configurations, demonstrating promising capabilities as a foundation for scaling evolutionary GPT training.

Result: The dynamic analysis highlighted significant variations across benchmark properties, stressing the importance of benchmark diversity for evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: Wasure provides an effective platform for standardized and deeper evaluation of WebAssembly performance, enhancing development and research.

Abstract: WebAssembly (Wasm) has become a key compilation target for portable and efficient execution across diverse platforms. Benchmarking its performance, however, is a multi-dimensional challenge: it depends not only on the choice of runtime engines, but also on hardware architectures, application domains, source languages, benchmark suites, and runtime configurations. This paper introduces Wasure, a modular and extensible command-line toolkit that simplifies the execution and comparison of WebAssembly benchmarks. To complement performance evaluation, we also conducted a dynamic analysis of the benchmark suites included with Wasure. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in code coverage, control flow, and execution patterns, emphasizing the need for benchmark diversity. Wasure aims to support researchers and developers in conducting more systematic, transparent, and insightful evaluations of WebAssembly engines.

### [422] [Doc2Spec: Synthesizing Formal Programming Specifications from Natural Language via Grammar Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04892)
*Shihao Xia,Mengting He,Haomin Jia,Linhai Song*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Doc2Spec uses large language models to automatically create formal specifications from natural-language rules, improving software reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writing precise specifications manually for formal verification is costly and challenging; automating this process can improve software correctness, security, and reliability.

Method: Doc2Spec employs a multi-agent framework powered by large language models to generate specification grammar and formal specifications from natural-language rules.

Result: Doc2Spec surpasses a baseline method without grammar induction and performs competitively against approaches with manually crafted grammar across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: Automated grammar induction using Doc2Spec enhances the reliability and quality of formal specifications, proving its efficacy in formalizing natural-language rules.

Abstract: Ensuring that API implementations and usage comply with natural language programming rules is critical for software correctness, security, and reliability. Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules.

### [423] [Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528)
*Danel Ahman,Ilja Sobolev*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a calculus that extends synchronous algebraic computational effects to include asynchronous operations and studies its normalization properties, concluding that it is strongly normalizing under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to expand the conventional approach to algebraic computational effects by incorporating asynchrony, enabling interpretations of complex asynchronous behaviors such as preemptive multi-threading and cancellable remote calls.

Method: The authors define a calculus for asynchronous algebraic effects, study its normalization properties under different conditions, and prove these properties using an approach extending Lindley and Stark’s framework.

Result: The study proves strong normalization for the calculus when general recursion is restricted and identifies conditions under which controlled asynchronous recursion maintains normalization.

Conclusion: The introduced calculus demonstrates strong normalization properties when carefully managing recursion, providing a theoretical foundation for diverse asynchronous computational models. All results are validated in Agda.

Abstract: Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.

### [424] [An Equational Axiomatization of Dynamic Threads via Algebraic Effects: Presheaves on Finite Relations, Labelled Posets, and Parameterized Algebraic Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05850)
*Ohad Kammar,Jack Liell-Cock,Sam Lindley,Cristina Matache,Sam Staton*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper establishes a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads using algebraic effects and parameterized algebraic theories, focusing on operations like 'fork' and 'wait' to study concurrency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a formal semantic foundation and equational reasoning framework for concurrency in dynamic threads, using algebraic effects to simplify analysis and modeling.

Method: By leveraging parameterized algebraic theories, the paper constructs a syntax for strong monads and formulates primitives like 'fork' and 'wait' alongside their algebraic semantics, introducing laws such as associativity. It further develops both operational and denotational semantics for a concurrent programming language.

Result: The axiomatization is proven to be complete, capturing equality of pomsets for closed expressions and syntactic equality for open expressions under all substitutions. Denotational semantics are sound, adequate, and fully abstract for labeled-poset observations.

Conclusion: The approach using algebraic effects and parameterized theories effectively models dynamic threads, capturing core concurrency semantics via primitive operations. This framework is robust, improving understanding and formalization of concurrency.

Abstract: We use the theory of algebraic effects to give a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads. Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.

### [425] [Signal or 'Noise': Human Reactions to Robot Errors in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05010)
*Maia Stiber,Sameer Khan,Russell Taylor,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores how people socially respond to a coffee robot's errors in real-world settings during repeated and group interactions, finding that these responses are both rich and noisy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the social signals people exhibit when interacting with robots in real-world scenarios, particularly during errors, and to address the gap in understanding human responses to robotic errors beyond lab settings.

Method: The researchers developed a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment involving 49 participants to observe social signals and responses to errors in repeated and group interactions.

Result: Participants consistently displayed diverse social signals in response to robot errors, with rich feedback especially prominent during group interactions, though these signals were also noisy.

Conclusion: Social signals can provide useful yet complex insights for understanding human-robot interactions in real-world settings, revealing both opportunities and challenges for leveraging these signals in practical applications.

Abstract: In the real world, robots frequently make errors, yet little is known about people's social responses to errors outside of lab settings. Prior work has shown that social signals are reliable and useful for error management in constrained interactions, but it is unclear if this holds in the real world - especially with a non-social robot in repeated and group interactions with successive or propagated errors. To explore this, we built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment ($N = 49$). We found that participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors and other stimuli, particularly during group interactions. Our findings suggest that social signals in the wild are rich (with participants volunteering information about the interaction), but "noisy." We discuss lessons, benefits, and challenges for using social signals in real-world HRI.

*Octavio Arriaga,Proneet Sharma,Jichen Guo,Marc Otto,Siddhant Kadwe,Rebecca Adam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for robotic systems to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and grasping in novel environments without extensive datasets or test-time sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems need to adapt to previously unseen objects in novel real-world environments efficiently, without dependence on large datasets or black-box models.

Method: The authors propose a differentiable neuro-graphics model combining neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to estimate scene parameters from single RGBD images and bounding boxes.

Result: The model outperformed existing algorithms in model-free few-shot pose estimation benchmarks and showed accuracy in a zero-shot grasping task using its scene reconstructions.

Conclusion: The approach provides a data-efficient, interpretable, and generalizable solution for robotic autonomy in diverse environments, enabling zero-shot physically-consistent scene reconstruction and interaction.

Abstract: Operating effectively in novel real-world environments requires robotic systems to estimate and interact with previously unseen objects. Current state-of-the-art models address this challenge by using large amounts of training data and test-time samples to build black-box scene representations. In this work, we introduce a differentiable neuro-graphics model that combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping without relying on any additional 3D data or test-time samples. Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.

*Vinal Asodia,Iman Sharifi,Saber Fallah*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper enhances camera-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for autonomous driving by integrating neuro-symbolic representations and dynamic reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve camera-based Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches that lack high-level scene context integration and rely on rigid reward functions.

Method: Proposed a neuro-symbolic feature representation encompassing semantic, spatial, and safety-critical features, along with a Soft First-Order Logic reward function using segmentation maps and linguistic rules.

Result: Experiments in CARLA simulation show improved policy robustness and safety performance under varied traffic and occlusion scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning can foster context-aware and value-aligned decision-making in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: The problem with existing camera-based Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches is twofold: they rarely integrate high-level scene context into the feature representation, and they rely on rigid, fixed reward functions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline that produces a neuro-symbolic feature representation that encompasses semantic, spatial, and shape information, as well as spatially boosted features of dynamic entities in the scene, with an emphasis on safety-critical road users. It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels. The findings demonstrate that integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning into Reinforcement Learning can support more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving.

*Thomas Cohn,Lihan Tang,Alexandre Amice,Russ Tedrake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new formulation for inverse kinematics (IK) using analytic solutions combined with optimization techniques to improve efficiency and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a unified approach for IK optimization combining analytic and optimization methods has been challenging, especially in handling nonlinear relationships and nonconvex constraints like collision avoidance.

Method: The proposed formulation incorporates analytic IK solutions as a change of variables to simplify optimization tasks and improve solver success rates.

Result: The new IK formulation achieved higher success rates in experiments involving collision avoidance, grasp selection, and humanoid stability across various constrained nonlinear optimization solvers.

Conclusion: This methodology effectively combines analytic and optimization methods for IK, leading to improved outcomes and robustness in solving complex robotics problems.

Abstract: Analytic and optimization methods for solving inverse kinematics (IK) problems have been deeply studied throughout the history of robotics. The two strategies have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but developing a unified approach to take advantage of both methods has proved challenging. A key challenge faced by optimization approaches is the complicated nonlinear relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector pose. When this must be handled concurrently with additional nonconvex constraints like collision avoidance, optimization IK algorithms may suffer high failure rates. We present a new formulation for optimization IK that uses an analytic IK solution as a change of variables, and is fundamentally easier for optimizers to solve. We test our methodology on three popular solvers, representing three different paradigms for constrained nonlinear optimization. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our new formulation achieves higher success rates than the old formulation and baseline methods across various challenging IK problems, including collision avoidance, grasp selection, and humanoid stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving precise and diverse manipulation tasks in robotic hands by optimizing fingertip design.

Method: Developed a hybrid fingertip with a compliant pulp and rigid fingernail; employed a strain-energy-based model to refine the fingertip's behavior; tested with various manipulation tasks.

Result: The robotic hand exhibited improved pinching stability, better force sensing, and excelled in manipulation tasks like paper singulation and orange peeling.

Conclusion: The combination of structured fingertip geometry and transparent mechanisms enhances precision and versatility in robotic hand manipulation.

Abstract: We present the PLATO Hand, a dexterous robotic hand with a hybrid fingertip that embeds a rigid fingernail within a compliant pulp. This design shapes contact behavior to enable diverse interaction modes across a range of object geometries. We develop a strain-energy-based bending-indentation model to guide the fingertip design and to explain how guided contact preserves local indentation while suppressing global bending. Experimental results show that the proposed robotic hand design demonstrates improved pinching stability, enhanced force observability, and successful execution of edge-sensitive manipulation tasks, including paper singulation, card picking, and orange peeling. Together, these results show that coupling structured contact geometry with a force-motion transparent mechanism provides a principled, physically embodied approach to precise manipulation.

### [430] [Informative Path Planning with Guaranteed Estimation Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05198)
*Kalvik Jakkala,Saurav Agarwal,Jason O'Kane,Srinivas Akella*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for environmental monitoring robots that combines geometric coverage with reduced oversampling. It guarantees estimation uncertainty by using a Gaussian process model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of environmental monitoring waste efforts by oversampling predictable regions or do not ensure reconstruction quality during path planning.

Method: A three-stage approach is proposed: (i) learn a Gaussian process model, (ii) transform the learned GP kernel into coverage maps, and (iii) plan an optimized route that meets uncertainty constraints. It includes nonstationary kernels for spatial variance in correlation and accommodates environments with obstacles.

Result: The method outperformed existing baselines by achieving the uncertainty target with fewer sensing locations and shorter travel distances. Real-world feasibility was demonstrated through field experiments with autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: This approach effectively balances coverage and estimation uncertainty, showing improvements in efficiency and applicability for environmental monitoring robots.

Abstract: Environmental monitoring robots often need to reconstruct spatial fields (e.g., salinity, temperature, bathymetry) under tight distance and energy constraints. Classical boustrophedon lawnmower surveys provide geometric coverage guarantees but can waste effort by oversampling predictable regions. In contrast, informative path planning (IPP) methods leverage spatial correlations to reduce oversampling, yet typically offer no guarantees on reconstruction quality. This paper bridges these approaches by addressing informative path planning with guaranteed estimation uncertainty: computing the shortest path whose measurements ensure that the Gaussian-process (GP) posterior variance -- an intrinsic uncertainty measure that lower-bounds the mean-squared prediction error under the GP model -- falls below a user-specified threshold over the monitoring region.
  We propose a three-stage approach: (i) learn a GP model from available prior information; (ii) transform the learned GP kernel into binary coverage maps for each candidate sensing location, indicating which locations' uncertainty can be reduced below a specified target; and (iii) plan a near-shortest route whose combined coverage satisfies the global uncertainty constraint. To address heterogeneous phenomena, we incorporate a nonstationary kernel that captures spatially varying correlation structure, and we accommodate non-convex environments with obstacles. Algorithmically, we present methods with provable approximation guarantees for sensing-location selection and for the joint selection-and-routing problem under a travel budget. Experiments on real-world topographic data show that our planners meet the uncertainty target using fewer sensing locations and shorter travel distances than a recent baseline, and field experiments with bathymetry-mapping autonomous surface and underwater vehicles demonstrate real-world feasibility.

Conclusion: MobileManiBench accelerates research in robotic manipulation by providing a scalable and controlled framework to study data efficiency and generalization of Vision-Language-Action models.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models have advanced robotic manipulation but remain constrained by reliance on the large, teleoperation-collected datasets dominated by the static, tabletop scenes. We propose a simulation-first framework to verify VLA architectures before real-world deployment and introduce MobileManiBench, a large-scale benchmark for mobile-based robotic manipulation. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and powered by reinforcement learning, our pipeline autonomously generates diverse manipulation trajectories with rich annotations (language instructions, multi-view RGB-depth-segmentation images, synchronized object/robot states and actions). MobileManiBench features 2 mobile platforms (parallel-gripper and dexterous-hand robots), 2 synchronized cameras (head and right wrist), 630 objects in 20 categories, 5 skills (open, close, pull, push, pick) with over 100 tasks performed in 100 realistic scenes, yielding 300K trajectories. This design enables controlled, scalable studies of robot embodiments, sensing modalities, and policy architectures, accelerating research on data efficiency and generalization. We benchmark representative VLA models and report insights into perception, reasoning, and control in complex simulated environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a minimal-sensing strategy for autonomous underwater robots to inspect submerged pipelines using lightweight sensors and computationally efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous underwater pipeline inspection faces challenges like turbidity, constrained spaces, and lack of reliable localization cues.

Method: Utilizes an IMU, a pressure sensor, and two sonars (single-beam and rotating sonar) with innovative sonar detection methods and an adaptive confidence-weighted proportional-derivative controller for pipe centering and traversal.

Result: Experiments with a 46 cm-diameter pipe and a BlueROV2 robot demonstrated stable pipe centering and successful traversal despite environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Minimal sensing and lightweight architecture can enable reliable autonomous underwater pipeline inspections, eliminating the need for complex sensor setups and external tracking.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater inspection of submerged pipelines is challenging due to confined geometries, turbidity, and the scarcity of reliable localization cues. This paper presents a minimal-sensing strategy that enables a free-swimming underwater robot to center itself and traverse a flooded pipe of known radius using only an IMU, a pressure sensor, and two sonars: a downward-facing single-beam sonar and a rotating 360 degree sonar. We introduce a computationally efficient method for extracting range estimates from single-beam sonar intensity data, enabling reliable wall detection in noisy and reverberant conditions. A closed-form geometric model leverages the two sonar ranges to estimate the pipe center, and an adaptive, confidence-weighted proportional-derivative (PD) controller maintains alignment during traversal. The system requires no Doppler velocity log, external tracking, or complex multi-sensor arrays. Experiments in a submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using a Blue Robotics BlueROV2 heavy remotely operated vehicle demonstrate stable centering and successful full-pipe traversal despite ambient flow and structural deformations. These results show that reliable in-pipe navigation and inspection can be achieved with a lightweight, computationally efficient sensing and processing architecture, advancing the practicality of autonomous underwater inspection in confined environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents AIDE, a framework allowing robots to interpret and act on unclear human instructions by combining interactive exploration and vision-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve robotic interpretation of ambiguous human instructions and real-time decision-making and execution in unstructured environments.

Method: Introducing AIDE, a dual-stream framework with Multi-Stage Inference (reasoning stream) and Accelerated Decision-Making (execution stream) for affordance analysis and instruction interpretation.

Result: Experiments show AIDE achieves over 80% task planning success and 95% execution accuracy, outperforming current vision-language methods.

Conclusion: AIDE significantly enhances robots' ability to handle ambiguous instructions and operate effectively in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Enabling robots to explore and act in unfamiliar environments under ambiguous human instructions by interactively identifying task-relevant objects (e.g., identifying cups or beverages for "I'm thirsty") remains challenging for existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods. This challenge stems from inefficient reasoning and the lack of environmental interaction, which hinder real-time task planning and execution. To address this, We propose Affordance-Aware Interactive Decision-Making and Execution for Ambiguous Instructions (AIDE), a dual-stream framework that integrates interactive exploration with vision-language reasoning, where Multi-Stage Inference (MSI) serves as the decision-making stream and Accelerated Decision-Making (ADM) as the execution stream, enabling zero-shot affordance analysis and interpretation of ambiguous instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that AIDE achieves the task planning success rate of over 80\% and more than 95\% accuracy in closed-loop continuous execution at 10 Hz, outperforming existing VLM-based methods in diverse open-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a scalable method for humanoid robots to effectively acquire soccer skills, addressing limitations in existing frameworks.

Method: Introduced a staged progression: human motion tracking, perception-action integration for positional adaptability, and sim-to-real physics-aware transfer.

Result: Demonstrated strong humanoid soccer performance on Unitree G1 robot, achieving human-like kicking with robustness across diverse conditions and environments.

Conclusion: PAiD enables robust soccer skill acquisition in humanoid robots and offers a scalable architecture for complex embodied tasks.

Abstract: Soccer presents a significant challenge for humanoid robots, demanding tightly integrated perception-action capabilities for tasks like perception-guided kicking and whole-body balance control. Existing approaches suffer from inter-module instability in modular pipelines or conflicting training objectives in end-to-end frameworks. We propose Perception-Action integrated Decision-making (PAiD), a progressive architecture that decomposes soccer skill acquisition into three stages: motion-skill acquisition via human motion tracking, lightweight perception-action integration for positional generalization, and physics-aware sim-to-real transfer. This staged decomposition establishes stable foundational skills, avoids reward conflicts during perception integration, and minimizes sim-to-real gaps. Experiments on the Unitree G1 demonstrate high-fidelity human-like kicking with robust performance under diverse conditions-including static or rolling balls, various positions, and disturbances-while maintaining consistent execution across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our divide-and-conquer strategy advances robust humanoid soccer capabilities and offers a scalable framework for complex embodied skill acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations in acquiring large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data hinder scaling Vision-Language-Action models for robot dexterous manipulation.

Method: The proposed Real-Sim-Real pipeline captures human demonstration data in standardized rooms, retargets human hand states to robot dex-hand states through tactile-aware optimization, and generates robot training data using photorealistic simulation.

Result: The retargeted trajectories achieved 84% success in 10 manipulation tasks, while trained VLA policies demonstrated 80% success in key tasks like pick-and-place, pushing, and pouring.

Conclusion: The Real-Sim-Real pipeline provides a scalable and cost-effective way to create high-fidelity robot training data from human demonstrations, reducing reliance on teleoperation with minimal loss in performance for dexterous tasks.

Abstract: Acquiring large-scale, high-fidelity robot demonstration data remains a critical bottleneck for scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in dexterous manipulation. We propose a Real-Sim-Real data collection and data editing pipeline that transforms human demonstrations into robot-executable, environment-specific training data without direct robot teleoperation. Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization. Then the retargeted robot trajectories are rendered in a photorealistic Isaac Sim environment to build robot training data. Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks. (2) VLA policies (Pi0.5) trained exclusively on our generated data achieve 80\% average success rate on three representative tasks, i.e., pick-and-place, pushing and pouring. To conclude, robot training data can be efficiently "painted" from human demonstrations using our real-sim-real data pipeline. We offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to teleoperation with minimal performance loss for complex dexterous manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces BusyBox, a benchmark to test Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models' ability to generalize affordances in manipulating objects with familiar physical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to enhance the evaluation of VLA models by introducing a benchmark to test their affordance generalization, which is crucial for handling unseen objects with familiar physical properties.

Method: The authors designed BusyBox, a physical benchmark containing configurable modules (switches, sliders, wires, buttons, etc.), which can be swapped and rotated to create variations for systematic evaluation of VLA models. They provide CAD files and assembly instructions for reproducibility.

Result: The experiments reveal that even strong VLAs struggle with affordance generalization using BusyBox. A dataset of language-annotated demonstrations collected on the benchmark is also provided.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved affordance generalization in VLAs and offers BusyBox as a practical tool for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners thanks to their promise of generalization. Although single-task policies still offer competitive performance, VLAs are increasingly able to handle commands and environments unseen in their training set. While generalization in vision and language space is undoubtedly important for robust versatile behaviors, a key meta-skill VLAs need to possess is affordance generalization -- the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features.
  In this work, we present BusyBox, a physical benchmark for systematic semi-automatic evaluation of VLAs' affordance generalization. BusyBox consists of 6 modules with switches, sliders, wires, buttons, a display, and a dial. The modules can be swapped and rotated to create a multitude of BusyBox variations with different visual appearances but the same set of affordances. We empirically demonstrate that generalization across BusyBox variants is highly challenging even for strong open-weights VLAs such as $π_{0.5}$ and GR00T-N1.6. To encourage the research community to evaluate their own VLAs on BusyBox and to propose new affordance generalization experiments, we have designed BusyBox to be easy to build in most robotics labs. We release the full set of CAD files for 3D-printing its parts as well as a bill of materials for (optionally) assembling its electronics. We also publish a dataset of language-annotated demonstrations that we collected using the common bimanual Mobile Aloha robot on the canonical BusyBox configuration. All of the released materials are available at https://microsoft.github.io/BusyBox.

### [438] [TaSA: Two-Phased Deep Predictive Learning of Tactile Sensory Attenuation for Improving In-Grasp Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05468)
*Pranav Ponnivalavan,Satoshi Funabashi,Alexander Schmitz,Tetsuya Ogata,Shigeki Sugano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents TaSA, a two-phased deep learning framework for improving dexterous robotic manipulation through self-touch perception and sensory attenuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic hands struggle to execute dexterous manipulations due to the challenge of distinguishing between self-contact tactile sensations and external object contacts, often resulting in object damage or limited real-world applicability.

Method: TaSA consists of two phases: (1) learning self-touch dynamics via predictive modeling of tactile feedback from the robot's actions, and (2) integrating this model into motion learning to highlight object contact signals during manipulation tasks.

Result: TaSA significantly improves success rates in insertion tasks like pencil lead insertion, coin placement, and paper clip fixing compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating self-touch perception rooted in sensory attenuation enables precision and success in complex robotic manipulations, confirming its importance in tactile discrimination.

Abstract: Humans can achieve diverse in-hand manipulations, such as object pinching and tool use, which often involve simultaneous contact between the object and multiple fingers. This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that anticipate the tactile consequences of their own motion, through a principle called sensory attenuation, where the nervous system differentiates predictable self-touch signals, allowing novel object stimuli to stand out as relevant. Deriving from this, we introduce TaSA, a two-phased deep predictive learning framework. In the first phase, TaSA explicitly learns self-touch dynamics, modeling how a robot's own actions generate tactile feedback. In the second phase, this learned model is incorporated into the motion learning phase, to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation. We evaluate TaSA on a set of insertion tasks, which demand fine tactile discrimination: inserting a pencil lead into a mechanical pencil, inserting coins into a slot, and fixing a paper clip onto a sheet of paper, with various orientations, positions, and sizes. Across all tasks, policies trained with TaSA achieve significantly higher success rates than baseline methods, demonstrating that structured tactile perception with self-touch based on sensory attenuation is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to combine language-driven semantic understanding and visual perception into drone navigation, addressing challenges in indoor navigation without traditional GPS or complex path-planning.

Method: VLN-Pilot employs a large Vision-and-Language Model (VLLM) for interpreting instructions and grounding them in visual data to autonomously navigate drones inside photorealistic indoor simulations.

Result: The framework achieves high success rates in executing complex navigation tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in handling semantic targets and adapting to dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: VLLM-based autonomous drone pilots reduce operator workload, improve safety, and enhance mission flexibility, paving the way for scalable indoor UAV applications like search-and-rescue and facility monitoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces VLN-Pilot, a novel framework in which a large Vision-and-Language Model (VLLM) assumes the role of a human pilot for indoor drone navigation. By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring. Our results suggest that VLLM-based pilots may dramatically reduce operator workload while improving safety and mission flexibility in constrained indoor environments.

Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in robotic locomotion, particularly dealing with hardware faults and disturbances during operation to enhance reliability in real-world scenarios.

Result: Validation experiments confirm the effectiveness of TOLEBI in handling faults on the humanoid robot TOCABI, demonstrating applicability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The study pioneers a learning-based fault-tolerant approach for bipedal locomotion, paving the way for robust robotic applications capable of handling real-world challenges.

Abstract: With the growing employment of learning algorithms in robotic applications, research on reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion has become a central topic for humanoid robotics. While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach. To our knowledge, this manuscript provides the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, thereby fostering the development of efficient learning methods in this field.

*Yufei Zhu,Shih-Min Yang,Martin Magnusson,Allan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HiCrowd integrates reinforcement learning with model predictive control to combat the freezing robot problem in dense human crowds, outperforming existing methods in navigation efficiency and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots struggle to navigate dense human crowds due to the freezing robot problem, where they fail to find safe motions and become immobile.

Method: HiCrowd is a hierarchical framework combining reinforcement learning and model predictive control. A high-level RL policy aligns the robot with crowd flows, while a low-level MPC ensures safe short-term movements.

Result: Experiments in offline and online settings using real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that HiCrowd improves navigation efficiency, safety, and reduces freezing behaviors.

Conclusion: Utilizing human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans as obstacles, significantly enhances robot navigation efficiency and safety in crowds.

Abstract: Navigating through dense human crowds remains a significant challenge for mobile robots. A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.

TL;DR: This paper presents a compact neuromorphic control system for robotic visual navigation, bridging sensor-based control and model-based planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic navigation struggles with indecision and computationally heavy planners when there are multiple goals without a clear preference.

Method: They use a neuromorphic control framework that transforms camera image pixels into motion commands through dynamic neuronal populations, incorporating a bifurcation mechanism to resolve indecision.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrates real-time, efficient navigation performance on both simulation setups and a quadrotor experiment.

Conclusion: The method offers real-time autonomous navigation with minimal computation requirements and direct compatibility with image processing pipelines.

Abstract: Robotic navigation has historically struggled to reconcile reactive, sensor-based control with the decisive capabilities of model-based planners. This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents 'AFT-Handover,' a framework for task-oriented human-robot handovers, integrating affordance reasoning via large language models and texture-based transfer for generalizable object handover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-oriented handover strategies lack the ability to generalize to new object-task scenarios effectively.

Method: The 'AFT-Handover' framework combines large language model-driven affordance reasoning with a texture-based transfer approach, enabling zero-shot generalization in object-task handovers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved handover success rates and reduced human regrasping compared to baselines. It also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in user preferences.

Conclusion: AFT-Handover is an effective and generalizable framework for human-robot handovers, with potential applications in real-world robotic collaboration, including on legged manipulators.

Abstract: Task-oriented handovers (TOH) are fundamental to effective human-robot collaboration, requiring robots to present objects in a way that supports the human's intended post-handover use. Existing approaches are typically based on object- or task-specific affordances, but their ability to generalize to novel scenarios is limited. To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. Finally, we demonstrate TOH on legged manipulators, highlighting the potential of our framework for real-world robot-human handovers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces XHugWBC, a framework enabling learning-based control policies to generalize across diverse humanoid robots without requiring individual training for each robot, achieving zero-shot transfer capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing humanoid robot controllers that require robot-specific training, and to create a universal controller that can generalize across different robot designs.

Method: The method combines (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across robots, and (3) effective policy architectures that understand robot-specific properties. It trains a policy over diverse morphological and dynamic characteristics of robots.

Result: The proposed framework enables a single control policy to robustly generalize across 12 simulated humanoids and 7 real-world robots, showing zero-shot adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that XHugWBC enables universal humanoid robot control with cross-embodiment capabilities, eliminating the need for robot-specific training and showing effective generalization to unseen designs.

Abstract: Learning-based whole-body controllers have become a key driver for humanoid robots, yet most existing approaches require robot-specific training. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-embodiment humanoid control and show that a single policy can robustly generalize across a wide range of humanoid robot designs with one-time training. We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots. Experiments on twelve simulated humanoids and seven real-world robots demonstrate the strong generalization and robustness of the resulting universal controller.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure using CNN for spatial features, GRU for temporal consistency, and combining multimodal data (depth camera, LiDAR, IMU).

Result: Multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% (depth-only) and 9.9% (LiDAR-only). Temporal integration using 3.2 s context reduces mapping drift.

Conclusion: The framework improves terrain perception accuracy and consistency, supporting better humanoid robot functionality in complex environments by leveraging multimodal and temporal data.

Abstract: Reliable terrain perception is a critical prerequisite for the deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations.

Motivation: Address the challenge of precise container lifting in urban recycling with a crane, requiring precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression.

Method: A residual reinforcement learning approach is applied, combining a Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy, leveraging simulations with domain randomization.

Result: Simulation showed improved accuracy, reduced oscillations, and increased success rates compared to a nominal controller.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances crane control by combining learned and model-based approaches, demonstrating better performance in simulations.

Abstract: This paper studies the container lifting phase of a waste-container recycling task in urban environments, performed by a hydraulic loader crane equipped with an underactuated discharge unit, and proposes a residual reinforcement learning (RRL) approach that combines a nominal Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy. All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.

Motivation: To address the need for practical methods to tune motion limits for indoor drones based on measured impact risk to ensure safety near humans.

Method: The method involves developing an end-to-end workflow comprising a replicable impact rig for testing, data-driven modeling of pre-impact speed to force, and software tools (scripts and ROS2 node) to enforce and log speed bounds for drones.

Result: The proposed system was validated on several quadrotors, showing that it meets safety constraints while maintaining task efficiency.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between impact test data and runtime safety certification for indoor drones, providing a replicable process, datasets, and open-source tools for the community.

Abstract: Indoor micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly used for tasks that require close proximity to people, yet practitioners lack practical methods to tune motion limits based on measured impact risk. We present an end-to-end, open toolchain that converts benchtop impact tests into deployable safety governors for drones. First, we describe a compact and replicable impact rig and protocol for capturing force-time profiles across drone classes and contact surfaces. Second, we provide data-driven models that map pre-impact speed to impulse and contact duration, enabling direct computation of speed bounds for a target force limit. Third, we release scripts and a ROS2 node that enforce these bounds online and log compliance, with support for facility-specific policies. We validate the workflow on multiple commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors and representative indoor assets, demonstrating that the derived governors preserve task throughput while meeting force constraints specified by safety stakeholders. Our contribution is a practical bridge from measured impacts to runtime limits, with shareable datasets, code, and a repeatable process that teams can adopt to certify indoor MAV operations near humans.

Motivation: Address failure modes in robot-object interactions during contact-rich tasks, where vision-only models struggle under conditions like occlusion or ambiguous contact states.

Method: Develop and train multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models to combine tactile and visual inputs for understanding contact physics and robot-object interactions.

Result: VT-WM showcases improvements in physical fidelity (33% better object permanence and 29% better compliance with motion laws) and achieves 35% higher success in zero-shot robot experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile sensing with vision boosts performance in contact-rich tasks, enhances planning success, and proves adaptable to novel scenarios with limited task demonstrations.

Abstract: We introduce multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM), which capture the physics of contact through touch reasoning. By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. Moreover, experiments show that grounding in contact dynamics also translates to planning. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks. Finally, VT-WM demonstrates significant downstream versatility, effectively adapting its learned contact dynamics to a novel task and achieving reliable planning success with only a limited set of demonstrations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of cooperative task completion by heterogeneous robots, requiring effective communication and information-gathering abilities.

Method: Proposes CommCP, a LLM-based decentralized communication framework using conformal prediction to improve communication reliability in the MM-EQA setting.

Result: CommCP significantly outperforms baselines in task success rate and exploration efficiency on the introduced MM-EQA benchmark.

Conclusion: The work introduces and solves an underexplored MM-EQA problem, providing a communication framework that enhances collaboration and task efficiency among heterogeneous robots.

Abstract: To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for generating formally verified Rust code using Verus. It produces the most extensive dataset of verified Rust programs, enabling the fine-tuning of a competitive model for code-proof generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of correctness in code generated by large language models (LLMs) and proposes a solution by generating formal correctness proofs alongside code, which requires higher reasoning capabilities.

Method: The VeruSyn pipeline leverages self-synthesis, tutorial-based synthesis, and agent trajectory synthesis to generate a large and feature-rich dataset of examples for training LLMs.

Result: Using VeruSyn, the researchers synthesized 6.9 million Rust programs with specifications and proofs, enabling the fine-tuning of a model that performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that VeruSyn significantly advances code-proof generation capabilities, creating more reliable and accurate tools for system software verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However, the correctness of code generated by LLMs remains a concern. A potential remedy to this concern is to have LLMs generate formal correctness proofs along with such code. However, compared with code generation, code-proof generation requires much higher reasoning capability and has much less existing data to learn from. In this paper, we present VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for Verus, a state-of-the-art verification tool for system software written in Rust. Through self-synthesis and tutorial-based synthesis, VeruSyn achieves much larger scale and Verus-feature coverage than previous data-synthesis techniques designed for Verus; VeruSyn also supplements its dataset with long-chain-of-thought (CoT) data through agent trajectory synthesis. With VeruSyn, we synthesize the largest set of Verus verified programs: 6.9 million Rust programs, each with a formal specification and a proof that it meets that specification. This dataset lets us create a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model with appealing cost-proof tradeoff compared with state-of-the-art commercial models like Claude Sonnet 4.5. It also significantly outperforms models like o4-mini and previously proposed research models.

### [453] [Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05458)
*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Emergence-as-Code" (EmaC), a framework to make the reliability of user journeys in microservices computable and manageable, addressing issues of drift and inefficiency in traditional SLO practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of maintaining user journey reliability in microservice systems, where current SLO practices do not fully account for interconnected factors like routing, redundancy, and failure domains.

Method: The paper introduces EmaC, which uses journey intent specifications and operational data (e.g., tracing, configuration) to infer reliable models, derive journey SLOs, and generate governance artifacts for system reliability.

Result: The proposed framework synthesizes reliable journey models, derives explicit journey SLOs with assumptions, and generates reviewable artifacts to improve governance in Git workflows.

Conclusion: EmaC enables a systematic and governable approach to managing user journey reliability in evolving microservice architectures, ensuring alignment with user expectations while optimizing resource provisioning.

Abstract: SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 < 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.

*Youjin Wang,Run Zhou,Rong Fu,Shuaishuai Cao,Hongwei Zeng,Jiaxuan Lu,Sicheng Fan,Jiaqiao Zhao,Liangming Pan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Activation Steering Adapter (ASA), a mechanism for efficient domain adaptation of LLM agents without expensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to adapt LLM agents efficiently to rapidly evolving toolsets and protocols while avoiding high costs and brittleness of traditional methods.

Method: ASA uses intermediate activations to generate routing signals and employs an ultra-light router for adaptive control during inference, bypassing training.

Result: ASA provides domain adaptation comparable to LoRA but with lower overhead and high transferability across models and domains.

Conclusion: ASA is practical for scalable and robust adaptation across multi-domain ecosystems with dynamic tool interfaces.

Abstract: For real-world deployment of general-purpose LLM agents, the core challenge is often not tool use itself, but efficient domain adaptation under rapidly evolving toolsets, APIs, and protocols. Repeated LoRA or SFT across domains incurs exponentially growing training and maintenance costs, while prompt or schema methods are brittle under distribution shift and complex interfaces. We propose \textbf{Activation Steering Adapter (ASA}), a lightweight, inference-time, training-free mechanism that reads routing signals from intermediate activations and uses an ultra-light router to produce adaptive control strengths for precise domain alignment. Across multiple model scales and domains, ASA achieves LoRA-comparable adaptation with substantially lower overhead and strong cross-model transferability, making it ideally practical for robust, scalable, and efficient multi-domain tool ecosystems with frequent interface churn dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper reviews and analyzes the application of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering documentation and modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how large language models can enhance software engineering tasks, especially in dealing with documentation and structured models.

Method: The authors conduct a literature review across four major venues, categorizing tasks, techniques, metrics, human evaluation approaches, and datasets related to LLM usage.

Result: Insights into the deployment of LLMs in solving software engineering tasks are provided, highlighting prompt methods, evaluation practices, and datasets.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence attracts significant attention, especially with the introduction of large language models. Its capabilities are being exploited to solve various software engineering tasks. Thanks to their ability to understand natural language and generate natural language responses, large language models are great for processing various software documentation artifacts. At the same time, large language models excel at understanding structured languages, having the potential for working with software programs and models. We conduct a literature review on the usage of large language models for software engineering tasks related to documentation and modeling. We analyze articles from four major venues in the area, organize them per tasks they solve, and provide an overview of used prompt techniques, metrics, approaches to human-based evaluation, and major datasets.

*Lucas Romao,Luiz Xavier,Júlia Condé Araújo,Marina Condé Araújo,Ariane Rodrigues,Marcos Kalinowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes RefineML, a requirements-focused approach tailored for ML systems integration in agile contexts, evaluated through industry-academia collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in Requirements Engineering and agile management for ML systems, such as data dependence, experimentation needs, and model behavior uncertainties.

Method: The study applied RefineML, integrated ML-specific specification and agile management practices, and evaluated through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews within a cybersecurity collaboration project.

Result: Findings showed high perceived usefulness and intention to use RefineML, improved communication, enabled feasibility assessments, and supported dual-track ML and software governance. Limitations on operationalizing ML into agile requirements remain.

Conclusion: RefineML enhances agile refinement for ML systems, resolving specific issues like governance and communication but needs refinement for operationalizing ML concerns into requirements and effort estimation.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-enabled systems challenge traditional Requirements Engineering (RE) and agile management due to data dependence, experimentation, and uncertain model behavior. Existing RE and agile practices remain poorly integrated and insufficiently tailored to these characteristics. This paper reports on the practical experience of applying RefineML, a requirements-focused approach for the continuous and agile refinement of ML-enabled systems, which integrates ML-tailored specification and agile management approaches with best practices derived from a systematic mapping study. The application context concerns an industry-academia collaboration project between PUC-Rio and EXA, a Brazilian cybersecurity company. For evaluation purposes, we applied questionnaires assessing RefineML's suitability and overall acceptance and semi-structured interviews. We applied thematic analysis to the collected qualitative data. Regarding suitability and acceptance, the results of the questionnaires indicated high perceived usefulness and intention to use. Based on the interviews, stakeholders perceived RefineML as improving communication and facilitating early feasibility assessments, as well as enabling dual-track governance of ML and software work, allowing continuous refinement of the model while evolving the overall software project. However, some limitations remain, particularly related to difficulties in operationalizing ML concerns into agile requirements and in estimating ML effort.

*Grace A. Lewis,Rachel Brower-Sinning,Robert Edman,Ipek Ozkaya,Sebastián Echeverría,Alex Derr,Collin Beaudoin,Katherine R. Maffey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quality model for machine learning components to address shortcomings in testing practices and enhance requirements elicitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address failures in model integration and operations due to limited testing that ignores system-derived requirements.

Method: Development and validation of a quality model focused on ML components through surveys and integration into a practical tool.

Result: Participants validated its relevance and value, and its practical application was demonstrated in an open-source ML testing tool.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves communication between ML developers and system stakeholders and focuses testing efforts on system-derived requirements.

Abstract: Despite increased adoption and advances in machine learning (ML), there are studies showing that many ML prototypes do not reach the production stage and that testing is still largely limited to testing model properties, such as model performance, without considering requirements derived from the system it will be a part of, such as throughput, resource consumption, or robustness. This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value. The quality model has been successfully integrated into an open-source tool for ML component testing and evaluation demonstrating its practical application.

*Altino Alves,Andre Hora*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces TestMigrationsInPy, a dataset of 923 real-world migrations from unittest to pytest in Python, assisting automated solutions for migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The migration from unittest to pytest in Python is beneficial but time-consuming, necessitating automated support for developers.

Method: The authors created the TestMigrationsInPy dataset, documenting real-world migrations and detailing migration types like assertions and fixtures.

Result: TestMigrationsInPy provides 923 documented migrations and categorizes migration types, enabling verification and development of novel migration solutions.

Conclusion: TestMigrationsInPy offers insights and serves as a reliable ground truth dataset for future research on automating testing framework migrations in Python.

Abstract: Unittest and pytest are the most popular testing frameworks in Python. Overall, pytest provides some advantages, including simpler assertion, reuse of fixtures, and interoperability. Due to such benefits, multiple projects in the Python ecosystem have migrated from unittest to pytest. To facilitate the migration, pytest can also run unittest tests, thus, the migration can happen gradually over time. However, the migration can be time-consuming and take a long time to conclude. In this context, projects would benefit from automated solutions to support the migration process. In this paper, we propose TestMigrationsInPy, a dataset of test migrations from unittest to pytest. TestMigrationsInPy contains 923 real-world migrations performed by developers. Future research proposing novel solutions to migrate frameworks in Python can rely on TestMigrationsInPy as a ground truth. Moreover, as TestMigrationsInPy includes information about the migration type (e.g., changes in assertions or fixtures), our dataset enables novel solutions to be verified effectively, for instance, from simpler assertion migrations to more complex fixture migrations. TestMigrationsInPy is publicly available at: https://github.com/altinoalvesjunior/TestMigrationsInPy.

### [459] [Exceptional Behaviors: How Frequently Are They Tested?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05123)

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how well exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world Python systems by analyzing exceptions that both propagate to and do not reach tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the lack of examination of exceptional behaviors in real-world systems, particularly exceptions not reaching test cases.

Method: Empirical study analyzing 25 Python systems using instrumented test suites to monitor runtime exceptions across 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions.

Result: 21.4% of executed methods raise exceptions, with 1 in 10 calls exercising exceptional behaviors in the median case. Around 80% of exception-raising methods do so infrequently, while 20% raise exceptions more frequently.

Conclusion: Exception-raising behaviors are not always rare or abnormal. Novel tools and methodologies are needed to support exceptional behavior testing and optimize exception-handling practices.

Abstract: Exceptions allow developers to handle error cases expected to occur infrequently. Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks. We also call attention to the fact that exception-raising behaviors are not necessarily "abnormal" or rare.

*Alireza Abbaspour,Shabin Mahadevan,Kilian Zwirglmaier,Jeff Stafford*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper highlights the need to include Quality Management (QM) components in safety analyses due to their potential risks introduced by AI integration, especially in driving automation perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent integration of AI in driving automation shows QM components can contribute to safety risks and compliance with AI standards requires addressing these concerns.

Method: Case studies analyze AI-driven perception systems in QM components, blending theoretical insights with practical examples to assess risks.

Result: Demonstrates how deficiencies in AI perception algorithms can create hazardous risks, urging a revision of safety frameworks and methodologies aligning FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards.

Conclusion: Recommends adopting updated safety methodologies for AI components across QM classifications to ensure comprehensive safety assurance.

Abstract: The intersection of Safety of Intended Functionality (SOTIF) and Functional Safety (FuSa) analysis of driving automation features has traditionally excluded Quality Management (QM) components from rigorous safety impact evaluations. While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components. The findings demonstrate the importance of revising existing safety frameworks to address the evolving challenges posed by AI, ensuring comprehensive safety assurance across all component classifications spanning multiple safety standards.

### [461] [EGSS: Entropy-guided Stepwise Scaling for Reliable Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05242)
*Chenhui Mao,Yuanting Lei,Zhixiang Wei,Ming Liang,Zhixiang Wang,Jingxuan Xu,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Agentic Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is enhanced by Entropy-Guided Stepwise Scaling (EGSS), which optimizes performance and computational efficiency for tasks like code generation and bug fixing. EGSS delivers 5-10% performance boosts and reduces inference-time token usage by 28%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in practical adoption of TTS due to its computational overhead, including costly ensemble deployment and lack of reliable candidate solution selection.

Method: EGSS introduces entropy-guided adaptive search and test-suite augmentation to dynamically balance efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments validate its impact on models.

Result: EGSS boosts performance by 5-10% across models, achieves new state-of-the-art results with GLM-4.6, and reduces inference token usage by over 28%.

Conclusion: EGSS enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, offering a practical solution for wider adoption and improved TTS performance on engineering tasks.

Abstract: Agentic Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has delivered state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex software engineering tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, its practical adoption remains limited due to significant computational overhead, primarily driven by two key challenges: (1) the high cost associated with deploying excessively large ensembles, and (2) the lack of a reliable mechanism for selecting the optimal candidate solution, ultimately constraining the performance gains that can be realized. To address these challenges, we propose Entropy-Guided Stepwise Scaling (EGSS), a novel TTS framework that dynamically balances efficiency and effectiveness through entropy-guided adaptive search and robust test-suite augmentation. Extensive experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that EGSS consistently boosts performance by 5-10% across all evaluated models. Specifically, it increases the resolved ratio of Kimi-K2-Intruct from 63.2% to 72.2%, and GLM-4.6 from 65.8% to 74.6%. Furthermore, when paired with GLM-4.6, EGSS achieves a new state-of-the-art among open-source large language models. In addition to these accuracy improvements, EGSS reduces inference-time token usage by over 28% compared to existing TTS methods, achieving simultaneous gains in both effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PatchGuru automates patch validation by inferring executable specifications from pull requests using large language models. Validating 400 PRs, it identified 24 bugs and improved detection precision compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current patch validation processes struggle due to incomplete regression tests and informal descriptions of patch intent. Developers face challenges in ensuring patches align with intended semantics.

Method: PatchGuru employs large language models to extract intent from pull request artifacts, synthesizes executable assertions across pre- and post-patch behaviors, refines oracles iteratively, and incorporates self-review techniques.

Result: Validated 400 PRs and reported 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, identifying 24 true positives including 12 undiscovered bugs. It outperformed Testora in bugs detected and precision, while maintaining low costs.

Conclusion: PatchGuru enhances code review and regression testing by offering executable documentation and automated patch validation at minimal cost, proving its efficacy in detecting bugs and refining patch intent validations.

Abstract: As software systems evolve, patches may unintentionally alter program behavior. Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62. PatchGuru incurs an average cost of 8.9 minutes and USD 0.07 per PR. These results suggest that PatchGuru complements code review and regression testing by providing executable documentation and automated validation of patch intent.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale analysis of fuzzing performance across programming languages, revealing differences in bug detection efficiency, vulnerability ratios, crash types, and patch coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether fuzzing effectiveness and bug characteristics differ across programming languages, which has not been examined in prior studies.

Method: Analyzing 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects across various programming languages.

Result: C++ and Rust show higher detection frequencies, Rust and Python expose critical vulnerabilities, crash types differ across languages, and unreproducible bugs are common in Go but rare in Rust.

Conclusion: Fuzzing efficiency and characteristics are influenced by programming language design, suggesting the need for language-specific fuzzing strategies and tools.

Abstract: Fuzzing has become a popular technique for automatically detecting vulnerabilities and bugs by generating unexpected inputs. In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Sovereign Reference Architecture for software systems that integrates Generative AI, self-sovereign identity, and blockchain to address sovereignty as an architectural property rather than just regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of architectural-level guidance for operationalizing digital sovereignty in software systems amidst evolving technology and regulatory landscapes.

Method: Proposed a reference architecture incorporating self-sovereignty, blockchain, sovereign data governance, and controlled deployment of Generative AI.

Result: Developed a framework that emphasizes sovereignty as an architectural attribute, highlighting Generative AI's dual role in governance risk and compliance enablement.

Conclusion: The architecture bridges regulatory requirements and system design, offering a foundation for creating jurisdiction-aware, AI-enabled systems and opens new avenues for further research.

Abstract: Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.

### [465] [Can We Classify Flaky Tests Using Only Test Code? An LLM-Based Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05465)
*Alexander Berndt,Vekil Bekmyradov,Rainer Gemulla,Marcus Kessel,Thomas Bach,Sebastian Baltes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) for classifying flaky tests using test code only, finding that they struggle to perform well, with performance only slightly above random guessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests disrupt software testing and automated quality assurance, and existing classifiers based on traditional machine learning lack practical applicability due to poor generalizability.

Method: The study evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose, one code-specific) using three prompting techniques across two benchmark datasets, supported by manual analysis on 50 samples to assess feasibility for humans using test code alone.

Result: LLMs were found to struggle with flaky test classification using only test code, achieving results barely better than random guessing; manual analysis confirmed a lack of sufficient information in test code alone for classification.

Conclusion: Improving flakiness classification may require incorporating additional context beyond test code, such as retrieval-augmented generation or agentic AI techniques.

Abstract: Flaky tests yield inconsistent results when they are repeatedly executed on the same code revision. They interfere with automated quality assurance of code changes and hinder efficient software testing. Previous work evaluated approaches to train machine learning models to classify flaky tests based on identifiers in the test code. However, the resulting classifiers have been shown to lack generalizability, hindering their applicability in practical environments. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generalize across various tasks. Thus, they represent a promising approach to address the generalizability problem of previous approaches. In this study, we evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose models, one code-specific model) using three prompting techniques on two benchmark datasets from prior studies on flaky test classification. Furthermore, we manually investigated 50 samples from the given datasets to determine whether classifying flaky tests based only on test code is feasible for humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to classify flaky tests given only the test code. The results of our best prompt-model combination were only marginally better than random guessing. In our manual analysis, we found that the test code does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a flakiness classification. Our findings motivate future work to evaluate LLMs for flakiness classification with additional context, for example, using retrieval-augmented generation or agentic AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for evaluating LLM robustness in cybersecurity tasks by generating semantically-equivalent challenge families using code transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTF benchmarks fail to effectively assess robustness and generalisation of agentic LLMs across different challenge versions.

Method: Using Evolve-CTF, the authors generate semantically-equivalent CTF families through program transformations and evaluate multiple LLM configurations.

Result: LLMs show robustness against simple transformations, but performance declines for complex obfuscation and composed transformations.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel tool and dataset for evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs in cybersecurity tasks with enhanced benchmarking techniques.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on cybersecurity tasks using capture-the-flag (CTF) benchmarks. However, existing pointwise benchmarks have limited ability to shed light on the robustness and generalisation abilities of agents across alternative versions of the source code. We introduce CTF challenge families, whereby a single CTF is used as the basis for generating a family of semantically-equivalent challenges via semantics-preserving program transformations. This enables controlled evaluation of agent robustness to source code transformations while keeping the underlying exploit strategy fixed. We introduce a new tool, Evolve-CTF, that generates CTF families from Python challenges using a range of transformations. Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families. Our work contributes a valuable technique and tool for future LLM evaluations, and a large dataset characterising the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of public datasets and benchmarks has restricted research and advancements in ArkTS code intelligence.

Method: Data from GitHub and Gitee ArkTS repositories was analyzed and processed using tree-sitter-arkts for extracting comment-function pairs and deduplication. Subsequently, code embedding models were fine-tuned for improved performance.

Result: The researchers successfully created a systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval and developed a fine-tuned, high-performing model.

Conclusion: This paper provides the first systematic dataset and performance metric for ArkTS code retrieval, promoting its further research. The resources have been made publicly available.

Abstract: ArkTS is a core programming language in the OpenHarmony ecosystem, yet research on ArkTS code intelligence is hindered by the lack of public datasets and evaluation benchmarks. This paper presents a large-scale ArkTS dataset constructed from open-source repositories, targeting code retrieval and code evaluation tasks. We design a single-search task, where natural language comments are used to retrieve corresponding ArkTS functions. ArkTS repositories are crawled from GitHub and Gitee, and comment-function pairs are extracted using tree-sitter-arkts, followed by cross-platform deduplication and statistical analysis of ArkTS function types. We further evaluate all existing open-source code embedding models on the single-search task and perform fine-tuning using both ArkTS and TypeScript training datasets, resulting in a high-performing model for ArkTS code understanding. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval. Both the dataset and our fine-tuned model will be released publicly and are available at https://huggingface.co/hreyulog/embedinggemma_arkts and https://huggingface.co/datasets/hreyulog/arkts-code-docstring,establishing the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an extensible and modular tool for verifying programs manipulating unbounded linked data structures effectively.

Method: Uses separation logic for memory representation and employs the Astral solver for satisfiability via translation to SMT.

Result: SEAL achieved competitive results and verified programs with unbounded lists; it was among the four analysers capable of this task.

Conclusion: SEAL's modular and extensible architecture has potential for significant improvement and better performance in future developments.

Abstract: SEAL is a static analyser for the verification of programs that manipulate unbounded linked data structures. It is based on separation logic to represent abstract memory states and, unlike other separation-logic-based approaches, it employs a general-purpose separation logic solver Astral for satisfiability and entailment checking, which itself is based on translation to SMT. This design results in a modular architecture intended to be easier to extend and to combine with reasoning in other theories. Although still a prototype, SEAL achieved competitive results in the LinkedLists base category and was one of only four analysers capable of verifying programs with unbounded lists. We believe that the tool's extensibility, combined with further development, can lead to significant improvements in future competitions.

### [469] [Towards Green AI: Decoding the Energy of LLM Inference in Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05712)
*Lola Solovyeva,Fernando Castor*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the energy consumption of AI-assisted coding tools during LLM inference, identifying ways to reduce it effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the significant computational and energy footprint of large language model (LLM) inferences in sustainable software development.

Method: The paper uses phase-level analysis to examine energy consumption during LLM inference, focusing on prefill and decoding phases across models of varying sizes, and evaluates them using code-centric benchmarks like HumanEval and LongBench.

Result: The study shows that prefill costs amplify energy usage during decoding, babbling behavior in some models inflates energy costs, and suppressing babbling decreases energy consumption by up to 89% without reducing accuracy.

Conclusion: The results underline that reducing energy in LLM inference requires addressing both babbling behavior and the effect of prefill costs on decoding.

Abstract: Context: AI-assisted tools are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, but their reliance on large language models (LLMs) introduces substantial computational and energy costs. Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding.

### [470] [A Dual-Loop Agent Framework for Automated Vulnerability Reproduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05721)
*Bin Liu,Yanjie Zhao,Zhenpeng Chen,Guoai Xu,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cve2PoC, a framework leveraging LLM agents to efficiently generate and validate Proof-of-Concept exploits for vulnerabilities from CVE descriptions, with improved performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual vulnerability reproduction from CVE descriptions is time-consuming and requires expertise; automation using current methods has limitations leading to inefficient debugging.

Method: Cve2PoC utilizes an LLM-based dual-loop framework - Strategic Planner for attack plans, Tactical Executor for code generation and validation, and Adaptive Refiner for refining failures through targeted loops.

Result: Cve2PoC achieved significant success rates (82.9% and 54.3%) on two benchmarks, surpassing baseline methods, with PoCs deemed comparable to human-written exploits.

Conclusion: By effectively separating attack strategy planning from code implementation refinement, Cve2PoC enhances automated vulnerability reproduction, providing efficient and quality results.

Abstract: Automated vulnerability reproduction from CVE descriptions requires generating executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and validating them in target environments. This process is critical in software security research and practice, yet remains time-consuming and demands specialized expertise when performed manually. While LLM agents show promise for automating this task, existing approaches often conflate exploring attack directions with fixing implementation details, which leads to unproductive debugging loops when reproduction fails. To address this, we propose Cve2PoC, an LLM-based dual-loop agent framework following a plan-execute-evaluate paradigm. The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the \textit{Tactical Loop} for code-level refinement, while the \textit{Strategic Loop} for attack strategy replanning. This dual-loop design enables the framework to escape ineffective debugging by matching remediation to failure type. Evaluation on two benchmarks covering 617 real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates that Cve2PoC achieves 82.9\% and 54.3\% reproduction success rates on SecBench.js and PatchEval, respectively, outperforming the best baseline by 11.3\% and 20.4\%. Human evaluation confirms that generated PoCs achieve comparable code quality to human-written exploits in readability and reusability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of transitioning legacy systems to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by introducing the Automated Quantum-safe Adaptation (AQuA) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of quantum computing poses a threat to traditional cryptographic methods, necessitating the development of new software tools to handle PQC's unique requirements and challenges.

Method: The paper proposes the AQuA framework with three pillars: PQC-aware detection, semantic refactoring, and hybrid verification for adapting legacy software to quantum-safe algorithms.

Result: AQuA is presented as a conceptual solution to facilitate the transition to PQC while addressing legacy software vulnerabilities and side-channel sensitivities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating Quantum-Safe Software Engineering (QSSE) as a new research focus for addressing the software adaptation challenges posed by quantum-safe cryptographic technologies.

Abstract: The quantum threat to cybersecurity has accelerated the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Migrating legacy software to these quantum-safe algorithms is not a simple library swap, but a new software engineering challenge: existing vulnerability detection, refactoring, and testing tools are not designed for PQC's probabilistic behavior, side-channel sensitivity, and complex performance trade-offs. To address these challenges, this paper outlines a vision for a new class of tools and introduces the Automated Quantum-safe Adaptation (AQuA) framework, with a three-pillar agenda for PQC-aware detection, semantic refactoring, and hybrid verification, thereby motivating Quantum-Safe Software Engineering (QSSE) as a distinct research direction.

### [473] [Automated Customization of LLMs for Enterprise Code Repositories Using Semantic Scopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05780)
*Ulrich Finkler,Irene Manotas,Wei Zhang,Geert Janssen,Octavian Popescu,Shyam Ramji*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores methods to customize large language models (LLMs) for improved code completion on private repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle to generate code aligned with private repositories due to the absence of relevant training data, necessitating strategies for effective model customization.

Method: The paper uses two strategies—Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT)—based on semantic scopes. Models are trained using real industry private code repositories and public benchmarks.

Result: Customized models, even those of smaller capacity, were shown to outperform larger uncustomized models in generating precise code suitable for private repositories.

Conclusion: Automating LLM customization with semantic scopes significantly boosts the accuracy of code completion for private repositories, enhancing developer productivity, with future prospects for more advancements.

Abstract: Code completion (CC) is a task frequently used by developers when working in collaboration with LLM-based programming assistants. Despite the increased performance of LLMs on public benchmarks, out of the box LLMs still have a hard time generating code that aligns with a private code repository not previously seen by the model's training data. Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity. We also include an analysis of customization on two public benchmarks and present opportunities for future work.

### [474] [When Elo Lies: Hidden Biases in Codeforces-Based Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05891)
*Shenyu Zheng,Ximing Dong,Xiaoshuang Liu,Gustavo Oliva,Chong Chun Yong,Dayi Lin,Boyuan Chen,Shaowei Wang,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper scrutinizes the reliability of Elo ratings for assessing Large Language Models' performance in competitive programming, uncovering significant sensitivities to experimental factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elo ratings for competitive programming are heavily used to evaluate LLMs, but variations in experiment details cause unreliable and inconsistent results.

Method: The authors systematically investigate hidden biases in Elo ratings, utilizing 37 Codeforces contests and 13,691 test cases to study three key factors: submission order, contest difficulty, and stochastic variability in LLM runs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate high variability in Elo ratings due to experimental factors: submission order shifts scores by 394 points, contest selection alters them by 1,122 points, and stochastic variability accounts for up to 349 point differences.

Conclusion: Elo ratings must be standardized and reported with detailed experimental setups to ensure reliable and meaningful comparisons of LLM capabilities.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve breakthroughs in complex reasoning, Codeforces-based Elo ratings have emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating competitive programming capabilities. However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings.

*Ye He,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Sayan Banerjee,Promit Ghosal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces finite-particle rates for the regularized Stein variational gradient descent (R-SVGD) and provides explicit non-asymptotic bounds for its convergence, addressing the trade-offs in tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct the constant-order bias in Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) and enhance finite-particle performance using a resolvent-like preconditioner.

Method: Applies a resolvent-type preconditioner to the kernelized Wasserstein gradient in R-SVGD and analyzes the resulting interactions through explicit non-asymptotic bounds in both continuous and discrete dynamics.

Result: Proves convergence in Fisher information and establishes Wasserstein-1 ($\mathrm{W}_1$) convergence under a specific condition, offering tuning rules for regularization, step size, and averaging horizon.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical guarantees and practical guidance for using R-SVGD, balancing the accuracy of gradient flow approximation with error control in finite-particle settings.

Abstract: We derive finite-particle rates for the regularized Stein variational gradient descent (R-SVGD) algorithm introduced by He et al. (2024) that corrects the constant-order bias of the SVGD by applying a resolvent-type preconditioner to the kernelized Wasserstein gradient. For the resulting interacting $N$-particle system, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds for time-averaged (annealed) empirical measures, illustrating convergence in the \emph{true} (non-kernelized) Fisher information and, under a $\mathrm{W}_1\mathrm{I}$ condition on the target, corresponding $\mathrm{W}_1$ convergence for a large class of smooth kernels. Our analysis covers both continuous- and discrete-time dynamics and yields principled tuning rules for the regularization parameter, step size, and averaging horizon that quantify the trade-off between approximating the Wasserstein gradient flow and controlling finite-particle estimation error.

TL;DR: Riemannian Flow Matching extends generative modeling to manifold-supported data using tangent vector field-based flows. Non-asymptotic Total Variation bounds are developed, accounting for curvature and parallel transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generative modeling for data that lies on non-Euclidean manifolds.

Method: RFM learns a time-dependent tangent vector field and analyzes convergence via differential inequalities controlling TV evolution, explicitly integrating curvature and parallel transport effects.

Result: Explicit TV bounds for manifold-supported samplers are derived, separating discretization and learning errors, with polynomial iteration complexities demonstrated for specific manifolds like hyperspheres and SPD manifolds.

Conclusion: RFM enables accurate generative modeling for manifold-supported data with practical convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds.

Abstract: Riemannian flow matching (RFM) extends flow-based generative modeling to data supported on manifolds by learning a time-dependent tangent vector field whose flow-ODE transports a simple base distribution to the data law. We develop a nonasymptotic Total Variation (TV) convergence analysis for RFM samplers that use a learned vector field together with Euler discretization on manifolds. Our key technical ingredient is a differential inequality governing the evolution of TV between two manifold ODE flows, which expresses the time-derivative of TV through the divergence of the vector-field mismatch and the score of the reference flow; controlling these terms requires establishing new bounds that explicitly account for parallel transport and curvature. Under smoothness assumptions on the population flow-matching field and either uniform (compact manifolds) or mean-square (Hadamard manifolds) approximation guarantees for the learned field, we obtain explicit bounds of the form $\mathrm{TV}\le C_{\mathrm{Lip}}\,h + C_{\varepsilon}\,\varepsilon$ (with an additional higher-order $\varepsilon^2$ term on compact manifolds), cleanly separating numerical discretization and learning errors. Here, $h$ is the step-size and $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy. Instantiations yield \emph{explicit} polynomial iteration complexities on the hypersphere $S^d$, and on the SPD$(n)$ manifolds under mild moment conditions.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces gradient flows of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with new properties that make them computationally efficient in high dimensions, relying on novel geometries like Radon-Wasserstein and Regularized Radon-Wasserstein.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore gradient flows that effectively evolve a distribution toward a target density while addressing computational challenges in high dimensions.

Method: New gradient flows based on Radon-Wasserstein and RRW geometries are introduced. These geometries depend only on 1D projections, enabling efficient numerical methods with a linear cost in both dimension and number of particles. Algorithms leverage the Fast Fourier Transform for computational efficiency.

Result: The authors demonstrate efficient, accurate algorithms and provide numerical experiments comparing convergence behavior. Theoretical results, including well-posedness and long-time convergence guarantees, are also presented.

Conclusion: These new gradient flows and algorithms perform well in high-dimensional settings and present practical advantages due to their computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADANA, a new optimizer that outperforms traditional AdamW by using time-varying schedules and damping mechanisms for large-scale language model training, providing up to 40% compute efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore limitations of fixed hyperparameters (β₁, β₂, and weight-decay λ) in AdamW, and determine whether time-varying schedules can improve training efficiency for large-scale language models.

Method: Develop a logarithmic-time scheduling approach for hyperparameters, pair it with damping mechanisms for stability, and introduce ADANA—an optimizer combining these advancements. Test the approach across multiple transformer models.

Result: ADANA achieves up to 40% improved compute efficiency over tuned AdamW, scales effectively to larger models, and shows robustness when adapted to other optimizers like AdEMAMix.

Conclusion: Time-varying hyperparameter schedules, paired with damping mechanisms, can significantly enhance training efficiency and stability in large-scale language models, proving beneficial across varying model scales.

Abstract: In practice, the hyperparameters $(β_1, β_2)$ and weight-decay $λ$ in AdamW are typically kept at fixed values. Is there any reason to do otherwise? We show that for large-scale language model training, the answer is yes: by exploiting the power-law structure of language data, one can design time-varying schedules for $(β_1, β_2, λ)$ that deliver substantial performance gains.
  We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time. Although naive variants of this are unstable, we show that suitable damping mechanisms restore stability while preserving the benefits of longer memory. Based on this, we present ADANA, an AdamW-like optimizer that couples log-time schedules with explicit damping to balance stability and performance. We empirically evaluate ADANA across transformer scalings (45M to 2.6B parameters), comparing against AdamW, Muon, and AdEMAMix.
  When properly tuned, ADANA achieves up to 40% compute efficiency relative to a tuned AdamW, with gains that persist--and even improve--as model scale increases. We further show that similar benefits arise when applying logarithmic-time scheduling to AdEMAMix, and that logarithmic-time weight-decay alone can yield significant improvements. Finally, we present variants of ADANA that mitigate potential failure modes and improve robustness.

*Beichen Wan,Mo Liu,Paul Grigas,Zuo-Jun Max Shen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in traditional sequential experimental design for predict-then-optimize setups and proposes a new directional uncertainty metric that improves efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequential experimental designs do not account for decision loss arising from downstream optimization problems, making them inefficient in predict-then-optimize scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce a novel directional-based uncertainty metric that quantifies predictive uncertainty without requiring costly optimization oracle computations. They also provide theoretical guarantees for its consistency and convergence.

Result: The proposed method achieves earlier stopping times and is more efficient compared to decision-blind designs, validated through experiments involving an LLM job allocation task.

Conclusion: The proposed directional uncertainty metric offers a more efficient and effective approach to sequential experimental design in predict-then-optimize frameworks, reducing unnecessary experimentation and improving practical outcomes.

Abstract: We consider the sequential experimental design problem in the predict-then-optimize paradigm. In this paradigm, the outputs of the prediction model are used as coefficient vectors in a downstream linear optimization problem. Traditional sequential experimental design aims to control the input variables (features) so that the improvement in prediction accuracy from each experimental outcome (label) is maximized. However, in the predict-then-optimize setting, performance is ultimately evaluated based on the decision loss induced by the downstream optimization, rather than by prediction error. This mismatch between prediction accuracy and decision loss renders traditional decision-blind designs inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a directional-based metric to quantify predictive uncertainty. This metric does not require solving an optimization oracle and is therefore computationally tractable. We show that the resulting sequential design criterion enjoys strong consistency and convergence guarantees. Under a broad class of distributions, we demonstrate that our directional uncertainty-based design attains an earlier stopping time than decision-blind designs. This advantage is further supported by real-world experiments on an LLM job allocation problem.

### [480] [Variance Reduction Based Experience Replay for Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05379)
*Hua Zheng,Wei Xie,M. Ben Feng,Keilung Choy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Variance Reduction Experience Replay (VRER), a method to improve reinforcement learning by selectively reusing informative samples to reduce variance during policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical experience replay which treats all past observations uniformly, ignoring their diverse contributions to learning efficiency.

Method: The authors propose VRER, a framework designed to selectively reuse informative samples, and integrate it into a sample-efficient off-policy algorithm, PG-VRER, with theoretical guarantees for finite-time convergence.

Result: The study proves that VRER accelerates policy learning, reveals a bias-variance trade-off, and demonstrates improved performance over state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms in empirical experiments.

Conclusion: VRER offers a principled and effective way to enhance reinforcement learning, providing algorithm-agnostic improvements and advancing understanding of experience replay in RL.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for complex stochastic systems requires leveraging historical data collected in previous iterations to accelerate policy optimization. Classical experience replay treats all past observations uniformly and fails to account for their varying contributions to learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Variance Reduction Experience Replay (VRER), a principled framework that selectively reuses informative samples to reduce variance in policy gradient estimation. VRER is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing policy optimization methods, forming the basis of our sample-efficient off-policy algorithm, Policy Gradient with VRER (PG-VRER). Motivated by the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis of experience replay, we develop a novel framework that explicitly captures dependencies introduced by Markovian dynamics and behavior-policy interactions. Using this framework, we establish finite-time convergence guarantees for PG-VRER and reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off: reusing older experience increases bias but simultaneously reduces gradient variance. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that VRER consistently accelerates policy learning and improves performance over state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms.

*Jingkai Huang,Will Ma,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian approach to improve LLM accuracy by identifying consistent answers with reduced sampling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) in tasks like math and reasoning through efficient sampling methods.

Method: Developing a stopping policy based on Bayesian prior information and the "L-aggregated" method to identify the most consistent answers with fewer samples.

Result: The approach achieves comparable accuracy while reducing LLM inference costs by up to 50%.

Conclusion: Using this method, tasks requiring consistent LLM responses can be optimized effectively with fewer computational resources.

Abstract: A simple strategy for improving LLM accuracy, especially in math and reasoning problems, is to sample multiple responses and submit the answer most consistently reached. In this paper we leverage Bayesian prior information to save on sampling costs, stopping once sufficient consistency is reached. Although the exact posterior is computationally intractable, we further introduce an efficient "L-aggregated" stopping policy that tracks only the L-1 most frequent answer counts. Theoretically, we prove that L=3 is all you need: this coarse approximation is sufficient to achieve asymptotic optimality, and strictly dominates prior-free baselines, while having a fast posterior computation. Empirically, this identifies the most consistent (i.e., mode) LLM answer using fewer samples, and can achieve similar answer accuracy while cutting the number of LLM calls (i.e., saving on LLM inference costs) by up to 50%.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the out-of-sample prediction error of weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) under nonstationarity, providing bounds and decompositions for the excess risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive understanding and guarantees for weighted ERM when dealing with distribution drift and nonstationary data.

Method: The authors decompose the excess risk into learning and drift-related terms, derive oracle inequalities under mixing conditions for uniform weight classes, and consider data and hypothesis complexities.

Result: The authors establish sharp bounds on learning error, validate them with regression problems on various models, and recover minimax-optimal rates in specific cases.

Conclusion: This research provides a robust framework for analyzing weighted ERM, enhancing theoretical guarantees for prediction under nonstationary settings and drift.

Abstract: Weighted empirical risk minimization is a common approach to prediction under distribution drift. This article studies its out-of-sample prediction error under nonstationarity. We provide a general decomposition of the excess risk into a learning term and an error term associated with distribution drift, and prove oracle inequalities for the learning error under mixing conditions. The learning bound holds uniformly over arbitrary weight classes and accounts for the effective sample size induced by the weight vector, the complexity of the weight and hypothesis classes, and potential data dependence. We illustrate the applicability and sharpness of our results in (auto-) regression problems with linear models, basis approximations, and neural networks, recovering minimax-optimal rates (up to logarithmic factors) when specialized to unweighted and stationary settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a theoretical foundation for scaling laws, plateau phenomena, and spectral structures in shallow neural networks designed for hierarchical multi-index targets.

Method: Information-theoretic scaling law derivation and analysis of phase transitions during hierarchical feature learning; proposing a target-agnostic spectral estimator and adapted representation techniques.

Result: Derived exact scaling laws for subspace recovery and prediction error—verified that a simple target-agnostic spectral estimator achieves these rates.

Conclusion: The work rigorously unifies scaling laws and learning dynamics in neural networks applied to hierarchical targets, achieving both theoretical and practical insights for optimized learning procedures.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a sharp theory of scaling laws for two-layer neural networks trained on a class of hierarchical multi-index targets, in a genuinely representation-limited regime. We derive exact information-theoretic scaling laws for subspace recovery and prediction error, revealing how the hierarchical features of the target are sequentially learned through a cascade of phase transitions. We further show that these optimal rates are achieved by a simple, target-agnostic spectral estimator, which can be interpreted as the small learning-rate limit of gradient descent on the first-layer weights. Once an adapted representation is identified, the readout can be learned statistically optimally, using an efficient procedure. As a consequence, we provide a unified and rigorous explanation of scaling laws, plateau phenomena, and spectral structure in shallow neural networks trained on such hierarchical targets.

Motivation: The motivation is the difficulty in certifying equality or tight upper bounds on the TV distance between two distributions in a distribution-free setting.

Method: The authors use the blurred TV distance as a relaxation of the TV distance and develop theoretical guarantees for computing bounds on it.

Result: They provide upper and lower bounds of the blurred TV distance without relying on assumptions about the distributions and analyze its behavior in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables distribution-free inference, demonstrating that the blurred TV distance is a promising tool for high-dimensional two-sample testing.

Abstract: Two-sample testing, where we aim to determine whether two distributions are equal or not equal based on samples from each one, is challenging if we cannot place assumptions on the properties of the two distributions. In particular, certifying equality of distributions, or even providing a tight upper bound on the total variation (TV) distance between the distributions, is impossible to achieve in a distribution-free regime. In this work, we examine the blurred TV distance, a relaxation of TV distance that enables us to perform inference without assumptions on the distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees for distribution-free upper and lower bounds on the blurred TV distance, and examine its properties in high dimensions.

### [485] [Wedge Sampling: Efficient Tensor Completion with Nearly-Linear Sample Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05869)
*Hengrui Luo,Anna Ma,Ludovic Stephan,Yizhe Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Wedge Sampling, a new sampling design, offers efficient low-rank tensor completion with reduced sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform entry sampling for tensor completion often requires very high sample complexity, which creates statistical and computational inefficiencies.

Method: Introduce Wedge Sampling, where observations are allocated to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in a bipartite sampling graph improving spectral signal for initialization.

Result: Polynomial-time algorithms for tensor recovery with nearly linear sample complexity are achieved through wedge sampling, alongside efficient refinement procedures.

Conclusion: Wedge Sampling significantly reduces the sample complexity compared to uniform sampling, potentially closing statistical-to-computational gaps in tensor completion.

Abstract: We introduce Wedge Sampling, a new non-adaptive sampling scheme for low-rank tensor completion. We study recovery of an order-$k$ low-rank tensor of dimension $n \times \cdots \times n$ from a subset of its entries. Unlike the standard uniform entry model (i.e., i.i.d. samples from $[n]^k$), wedge sampling allocates observations to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in an associated bipartite sampling graph. By directly promoting these length-two connections, the sampling design strengthens the spectral signal that underlies efficient initialization, in regimes where uniform sampling is too sparse to generate enough informative correlations.
  Our main result shows that this change in sampling paradigm enables polynomial-time algorithms to achieve both weak and exact recovery with nearly linear sample complexity in $n$. The approach is also plug-and-play: wedge-sampling-based spectral initialization can be combined with existing refinement procedures (e.g., spectral or gradient-based methods) using only an additional $\tilde{O}(n)$ uniformly sampled entries, substantially improving over the $\tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ sample complexity typically required under uniform entry sampling for efficient methods. Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier.

### [486] [Transformers Are Born Biased: Structural Inductive Biases at Random Initialization and Their Practical Consequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05927)
*Siquan Li,Yao Tong,Haonan Wang,Tianyang Hu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Randomly initialized transformers exhibit token preferences and structural biases, driven by asymmetric activations and self-attention mechanics, which persist through training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Questioning the assumption that transformers are behaviorally unstructured at random initialization, exploring whether meaningful patterns exist even before training.

Method: Dissection of transformer architecture, analyzing model mechanics at initialization, and introducing SeedPrint for model identification based on random initialization fingerprints.

Result: Untrained models show extreme token biases. These biases are mechanistically explained and traced to the architecture itself. Fingerprinting method SeedPrint proves effective at distinguishing initialization differences.

Conclusion: Random initialization induces structural biases in transformers. These biases persist through training and provide insights into attention-sink phenomena, actionable for improving model control.

Abstract: Transformers underpin modern large language models (LLMs) and are commonly assumed to be behaviorally unstructured at random initialization, with all meaningful preferences emerging only through large-scale training. We challenge this assumption by showing that randomly initialized transformers already exhibit strong and systematic structural biases. In particular, untrained models display extreme token preferences: across random input sequences, certain tokens are predicted with probabilities orders of magnitude larger.
  We provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by dissecting the transformer architecture at initialization. We show that extreme token preference arises from a contraction of token representations along a random seed-dependent direction. This contraction is driven by two interacting forces: (i) asymmetric nonlinear activations in MLP sublayers induce global (inter-sequence) representation concentration, and (ii) self-attention further amplifies this effect through local (intra-sequence) aggregation. Together, these mechanisms align hidden representations along a direction determined solely by the random initialization, producing highly non-uniform next-token predictions.
  Beyond mechanistic insight, we demonstrate that these initialization-induced biases persist throughout training, forming a stable and intrinsic model identity. Leveraging this property, we introduce SeedPrint, a fingerprinting method that can reliably distinguish models that differ only in their random initialization, even after extensive training and under substantial distribution shift. Finally, we identify a fundamental positional discrepancy inherent to the attention mechanism's intra-sequence contraction that is causally linked to the attention-sink phenomenon. This discovery provides a principled explanation for the emergence of sinks and offers a pathway for their control.

### [487] [Causal Inference on Stopped Random Walks in Online Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05997)
*Jia Yuan Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses causal inference in online advertising systems focusing on estimating long-term effects of advertising mechanisms using advanced statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in estimating long-term effects of advertising mechanisms, which significantly influence user engagement and advertiser behavior in dynamic online systems.

Method: The authors conceptualize the problem as a stopped random walk and employ statistical techniques such as budget-splitting experimental design, the Anscombe Theorem, Wald-like equations, and a Central Limit Theorem to construct confidence intervals.

Result: The research introduces methods to accurately measure and interpret long-term treatment effects in dynamic, non-i.i.d. environments influenced by auction parameters.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust framework for understanding the impacts of advertising mechanisms on user engagement, advertiser behavior, and system-wide outcomes over time.

Abstract: We consider a causal inference problem frequently encountered in online advertising systems, where a publisher (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) interacts repeatedly with human users and advertisers by sporadically displaying to each user an advertisement selected through an auction. Each treatment corresponds to a parameter value of the advertising mechanism (e.g., auction reserve-price), and we want to estimate through experiments the corresponding long-term treatment effect (e.g., annual advertising revenue). In our setting, the treatment affects not only the instantaneous revenue from showing an ad, but also changes each user's interaction-trajectory, and each advertiser's bidding policy -- as the latter is constrained by a finite budget. In particular, each a treatment may even affect the size of the population, since users interact longer with a tolerable advertising mechanism. We drop the classical i.i.d. assumption and model the experiment measurements (e.g., advertising revenue) as a stopped random walk, and use a budget-splitting experimental design, the Anscombe Theorem, a Wald-like equation, and a Central Limit Theorem to construct confidence intervals for the long-term treatment effect.

### [488] [Diffusion Model's Generalization Can Be Characterized by Inductive Biases toward a Data-Dependent Ridge Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06021)
*Ye He,Yitong Qiu,Molei Tao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates the generalization behavior of diffusion models and introduces the concept of the log-density ridge manifold to describe how generated data aligns and evolves with this manifold during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the generalization dynamics of diffusion models and their performance for downstream applications.

Method: The authors define the log-density ridge manifold and analyze inference dynamics with three specific processes: reach, align, and slide. They also explore these processes under varying training errors and assess the inductive biases by examining the interplay of architectural bias and training dynamics.

Result: The paper provides insights into the reach, align, and slide behavior toward the ridge manifold, characterizing inter-mode generation and inductive bias evolution. Empirical experiments with synthetic multimodal data and MNIST confirm the predicted effects.

Conclusion: A better understanding of training dynamics and inference behavior can enhance the quantification of generation bias in diffusion models, paving the way for improved downstream applications.

Abstract: When a diffusion model is not memorizing the training data set, how does it generalize exactly? A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions.

*Chunyat Wu,Jiajun Deng,Zhengxi Liu,Zheqi Dai,Haolin He,Qiuqiang Kong*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARCHI-TTS, a non-autoregressive TTS system that provides improved text-speech alignment and faster synthesis with competitive accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in diffusion-based TTS systems, specifically text-speech alignment problems and high computational costs of denoising processes.

Method: The method involves using a semantic aligner for alignment robustness, reusing encoder features to speed up synthesis, and applying an auxiliary CTC loss for better semantic understanding.

Result: Results show that ARCHI-TTS achieved superior metrics in word error rate (WER) on datasets like LibriSpeech-PC and SeedTTS while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: ARCHI-TTS successfully improves text-to-speech alignment and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art systems in terms of both speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based, non-autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems have demonstrated impressive zero-shot synthesis capabilities, their efficacy is still hindered by two key challenges: the difficulty of text-speech alignment modeling and the high computational overhead of the iterative denoising process. To address these limitations, we propose ARCHI-TTS that features a dedicated semantic aligner to ensure robust temporal and semantic consistency between text and audio. To overcome high computational inference costs, ARCHI-TTS employs an efficient inference strategy that reuses encoder features across denoising steps, drastically accelerating synthesis without performance degradation. An auxiliary CTC loss applied to the condition encoder further enhances the semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that ARCHI-TTS achieves a WER of 1.98% on LibriSpeech-PC test-clean, and 1.47%/1.42% on SeedTTS test-en/test-zh with a high inference efficiency, consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art TTS systems.

*Wenhao Li,Anastasis Kratsios,Hrad Ghoukasian,Dennis Zvigelsky*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning architecture capable of reasoning universally through any Boolean task while certifiably generating valid Boolean circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between theoretical capabilities of neural networks and practical performance in solving Boolean reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes a model that parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits, ensuring every sample is almost surely a valid circuit. Demonstrates universality and efficient parameter scaling.

Result: Empirical evaluations show reliable training, high accuracy in truth-table benchmark tasks, and structural preservation of Boolean values in internal units.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture achieves universal Boolean reasoning with certification and offers advantages over typical models in terms of structural fidelity and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: The proliferation of agentic systems has thrust the reasoning capabilities of AI into the forefront of contemporary machine learning. While it is known that there \emph{exist} neural networks which can reason through any Boolean task $f:\{0,1\}^B\to\{0,1\}$, in the sense that they emulate Boolean circuits with fan-in $2$ and fan-out $1$ gates, trained models have been repeatedly demonstrated to fall short of these theoretical ideals. This raises the question: \textit{Can one exhibit a deep learning model which \textbf{certifiably} always reasons and can \textbf{universally} reason through any Boolean task?} Moreover, such a model should ideally require few parameters to solve simple Boolean tasks.
  We answer this question affirmatively by exhibiting a deep learning architecture which parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits with the guarantee that, for every parameter configuration, a sample is almost surely a valid Boolean circuit (and hence admits an intrinsic circuit-level certificate). We then prove a universality theorem: for any Boolean $f:\{0,1\}^B\to\{0,1\}$, there exists a parameter configuration under which the sampled circuit computes $f$ with arbitrarily high probability. When $f$ is an $\mathcal{O}(\log B)$-junta, the required number of parameters scales linearly with the input dimension $B$.
  Empirically, on a controlled truth-table completion benchmark aligned with our setting, the proposed architecture trains reliably and achieves high exact-match accuracy while preserving the predicted structure: every internal unit is Boolean-valued on $\{0,1\}^B$. Matched MLP baselines reach comparable accuracy, but only about $10\%$ of hidden units admit a Boolean representation; i.e.\ are two-valued over the Boolean cube.

*Max Großmann,Malte Grunert,Erich Runge*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper investigates neural scaling laws for predicting dielectric functions of metals using graph neural networks and a dataset of over 200,000 dielectric functions. It observes model parameter scaling follows a power law while dataset size scaling exhibits deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding neural scaling laws is crucial in materials science due to the scarcity and cost of generating data. It aims to provide insights into data requirements and optimal model design for predicting dielectric functions of metals.

Method: Two multi-objective graph neural networks are trained using over 200,000 dielectric functions generated from high-throughput ab initio calculations. The models predict both frequency-dependent interband dielectric functions and Drude frequency.

Result: Scaling laws for dataset size demonstrate deviations, while scaling with model parameters adheres to a power-law relationship and saturates quickly.

Conclusion: The findings reveal distinct neural scaling behaviors for dataset size and model parameters, offering guidance for dataset design and model development in materials science tasks.

Abstract: In materials science, data are scarce and expensive to generate, whether computationally or experimentally. Therefore, it is crucial to identify how model performance scales with dataset size and model capacity to distinguish between data- and model-limited regimes. Neural scaling laws provide a framework for quantifying this behavior and guide the design of materials datasets and machine learning architectures. Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency. We observe broken neural scaling laws with respect to dataset size, whereas scaling with the number of model parameters follows a simple power law that rapidly saturates.

*Indronil Bhattacharjee,Christabel Wayllace*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper studies the cold start problem in Knowledge Tracing (KT) models and evaluates their performance exclusively on new students, focusing on Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN), and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the cold start problem in KT models, which involves accurately predicting the knowledge states of new students with limited interaction data.

Method: The paper explores the performance of three KT models (DKT, DKVMN, SAKT) under cold start conditions on ASSISTments 2009, 2015, and 2017 datasets. It trains models solely on historical data and tests their generalizability on new students.

Result: All models initially struggle under cold start conditions but improve with more interactions. SAKT performs better initially but still faces limitations in generalization.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for KT models that can generalize better to new learners, advocating for models robust to few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: KnowledgeTracing (KT) involves predicting students' knowledge states based on their interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). A key challenge is the cold start problem, accurately predicting knowledge for new students with minimal interaction data. Unlike prior work, which typically trains KT models on initial interactions of all students and tests on their subsequent interactions, our approach trains models solely using historical data from past students, evaluating their performance exclusively on entirely new students. We investigate cold start effects across three KT models: Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN), and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT), using ASSISTments 2009, 2015, and 2017 datasets. Results indicate all models initially struggle under cold start conditions but progressively improve with more interactions; SAKT shows higher initial accuracy yet still faces limitations. These findings highlight the need for KT models that effectively generalize to new learners, emphasizing the importance of developing models robust in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios

### [493] [Ethology of Latent Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05710)
*Philippe Boisnard*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study examines how biases and divergences manifest in the latent spaces of vision language models (VLMs) in their interpretations of art, revealing algorithmic sensitivities shaped by training data and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to challenge the assumption that latent spaces in VLMs are neutral and explores their bias and sensitivity influenced by model architectures and training data.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative study among three VLMs (OpenAI CLIP, OpenCLIP LAION, SigLIP) applied to 301 artworks, using bipolar semantic axes to analyze political and cultural categorization.

Result: The models exhibited substantial differences in categorization, with SigLIP significantly more inclined to label artworks as politically engaged. African masks, for instance, received diverse political classifications depending on the model.

Conclusion: The paper argues that training datasets act as quasi-archives embedding specific discursive formations in latent spaces, calling for revisited methodologies that consider these sensitivities when deploying VLMs in cultural interpretation contexts.

Abstract: This study challenges the presumed neutrality of latent spaces in vision language models (VLMs) by adopting an ethological perspective on their algorithmic behaviors. Rather than constituting spaces of homogeneous indeterminacy, latent spaces exhibit model-specific algorithmic sensitivities, understood as differential regimes of perceptual salience shaped by training data and architectural choices.
  Through a comparative analysis of three models (OpenAI CLIP, OpenCLIP LAION, SigLIP) applied to a corpus of 301 artworks (15th to 20th), we reveal substantial divergences in the attribution of political and cultural categories. Using bipolar semantic axes derived from vector analogies (Mikolov et al., 2013), we show that SigLIP classifies 59.4% of the artworks as politically engaged, compared to only 4% for OpenCLIP. African masks receive the highest political scores in SigLIP while remaining apolitical in OpenAI CLIP. On an aesthetic colonial axis, inter-model discrepancies reach 72.6 percentage points.
  We introduce three operational concepts: computational latent politicization, describing the emergence of political categories without intentional encoding; emergent bias, irreducible to statistical or normative bias and detectable only through contrastive analysis; and three algorithmic scopic regimes: entropic (LAION), institutional (OpenAI), and semiotic (SigLIP), which structure distinct modes of visibility. Drawing on Foucault's notion of the archive, Jameson's ideologeme, and Simondon's theory of individuation, we argue that training datasets function as quasi-archives whose discursive formations crystallize within latent space. This work contributes to a critical reassessment of the conditions under which VLMs are applied to digital art history and calls for methodologies that integrate learning architectures into any delegation of cultural interpretation to algorithmic agents.

*James Gao,Josh Zhou,Qi Sun,Ryan Huang,Steven Yoo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Atomic Information Flow (AIF), a graph network model for better traceability and accuracy in Retrieval Augmented Generation systems, and demonstrates its effectiveness via improvements in a smaller language model's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack reliable methods to trace responses back to tool components, which hampers their transparency and effectiveness as they evolve into more complex architectures.

Method: The authors propose Atomic Information Flow (AIF), which uses a graph-based network flow model to break down tool and LLM outputs into atomic units of information. A lightweight language model is trained on offline signals from AIF for enhanced information attribution.

Result: The base Gemma3-4B model achieves 54.7% accuracy on HotpotQA, but training it with AIF signals improves this to 82.71%, while also compressing 87.52% of unnecessary context tokens.

Conclusion: Training smaller models like Gemma3-4B with AIF signals significantly boosts their performance, enabling smaller, more efficient models to bridge the performance gap with much larger models.

Abstract: Many tool-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack precise mechanisms for tracing final responses back to specific tool components -- a critical gap as systems scale to complex multi-agent architectures. We present \textbf{Atomic Information Flow (AIF)}, a graph-based network flow model that decomposes tool outputs and LLM calls into atoms: indivisible, self-contained units of information. By modeling LLM orchestration as a directed flow of atoms from tool and LLM nodes to a response super-sink, AIF enables granular attribution metrics for AI explainability.
  Motivated by the max-flow min-cut theorem in network flow theory, we train a lightweight Gemma3 (4B parameter) language model as a context compressor to approximate the minimum cut of tool atoms using flow signals computed offline by AIF. We note that the base Gemma3-4B model struggles to identify critical information with \textbf{54.7\%} accuracy on HotpotQA, barely outperforming lexical baselines (BM25). However, post-training on AIF signals boosts accuracy to \textbf{82.71\%} (+28.01 points) while achieving \textbf{87.52\%} (+1.85\%) context token compression -- bridging the gap with the Gemma3-27B variant, a model nearly $7\times$ larger.

TL;DR: The study proposes Multi-Field Tool Retrieval to improve LLMs' tool selection by addressing challenges in tool documentation and query alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance tool retrieval for LLMs, addressing issues like incomplete and inconsistent tool documentation, mismatches between queries and tool descriptions, and the multi-dimensional aspects of tools.

Method: The paper introduces Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, which models tools in fine-grained fields to align better with user intent.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across five datasets and a mixed benchmark, showcasing high generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: Multi-Field Tool Retrieval provides an effective solution for improving tool alignment for LLMs, overcoming key limitations in existing tool retrieval practices.

Abstract: Integrating external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with real-world environments and solve complex tasks. Given the growing scale of available tools, effective tool retrieval is essential to mitigate constraints of LLMs' context windows and ensure computational efficiency. Existing approaches typically treat tool retrieval as a traditional ad-hoc retrieval task, matching user queries against the entire raw tool documentation. In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling. Experimental results show that our framework achieves SOTA performance on five datasets and a mixed benchmark, exhibiting superior generalizability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of gathering relevant definitions for keywords amidst the increasing volume of scientific literature.

Method: The authors developed SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction, tested on two novel datasets, and evaluated using multiple language models and prompt strategies.

Result: SciDef demonstrated an ability to extract 86.4% of definitions from the test set, with multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting enhancing performance.

Conclusion: SciDef shows promise for definition extraction in scientific texts, but future work should focus on identifying the most relevant definitions, as models currently over-generate them.

Abstract: Definitions are the foundation for any scientific work, but with a significant increase in publication numbers, gathering definitions relevant to any keyword has become challenging. We therefore introduce SciDef, an LLM-based pipeline for automated definition extraction. We test SciDef on DefExtra & DefSim, novel datasets of human-extracted definitions and definition-pairs' similarity, respectively. Evaluating 16 language models across prompting strategies, we demonstrate that multi-step and DSPy-optimized prompting improve extraction performance. To evaluate extraction, we test various metrics and show that an NLI-based method yields the most reliable results. We show that LLMs are largely able to extract definitions from scientific literature (86.4% of definitions from our test-set); yet future work should focus not just on finding definitions, but on identifying relevant ones, as models tend to over-generate them.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multi-task training strategies for text embedding models, proposing a robust merging method to improve performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in training and adapting general-purpose text embedding models for evolving domains and data types, while handling task conflicts and retaining efficiency.

Method: Systematic comparison of multi-task training strategies (e.g., batch-level shuffling, sequential training), introducing a Bagging-based robust model merging () for improved generalization and efficient incremental updates.

Result:  improves in-domain and out-of-domain performance, reduces training cost for incremental learning, and demonstrates robustness.

Conclusion:  provides an effective and efficient strategy for enhancing general-purpose text embeddings, surpassing traditional batch-level shuffling.

Abstract: General-purpose text embedding models underpin a wide range of NLP and information retrieval applications, and are typically trained on large-scale multi-task corpora to encourage broad generalization. However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a benchmark for evaluating scientific literature retrieval methods. It investigates LLM-based retrievers and finds that traditional BM25 methods outperform LLM-based retrievers significantly, while suggesting an improvement framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLM-based retrievers can effectively enhance workflows of deep research agents in scientific literature retrieval, given their instruction-following and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study introduces SAGE, a scientific literature retrieval benchmark consisting of queries across scientific domains and evaluates multiple systems, comparing BM25 with LLM-based retrievers. It also proposes a scaling framework utilizing LLMs for better retrieval.

Result: BM25 outperforms LLM-based retrievers by 30% due to keyword-oriented sub-query generation in deep research agents, while the proposed scaling framework achieves measurable performance gains for retrieval.

Conclusion: LLM-based retrievers, despite their reasoning capabilities, underperform compared to traditional methods like BM25 in scientific literature retrieval tasks. Optimizations like metadata augmentation can recover some effectiveness.

Abstract: Deep research agents have emerged as powerful systems for addressing complex queries. Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus.We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic theorem retrieval tool for large mathematical corpora, improving search precision for professional mathematicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Searching mathematical results and identifying specific theorems, lemmas, or propositions from vast mathematical corpora is challenging and requires better retrieval tools.

Method: The authors created a unified corpus of 9.2 million theorems and systematically evaluated representation strategies, embedding models, language models, and prompting for semantic search.

Result: The tool substantially improved theorem-level and paper-level retrieval quality for professional mathematicians compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Semantic theorem search can be effectively applied at scale, improving the precision and utility of mathematical information retrieval for researchers.

Abstract: Searching for mathematical results remains difficult: most existing tools retrieve entire papers, while mathematicians and theorem-proving agents often seek a specific theorem, lemma, or proposition that answers a query. While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of $9.2$ million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On a curated evaluation set of theorem-search queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale. The theorem search tool is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/spaces/uw-math-ai/theorem-search}{this link}, and the dataset is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/TheoremSearch}{this link}.

### [500] [LMMRec: LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05474)
*Yicheng Di,Zhanjie Zhang,Yun Wangc,Jinren Liue,Jiaqi Yanf,Jiyu Wei,Xiangyu Chend,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes LMMRec, a recommendation framework leveraging large language models for better multimodal motivation modeling, overcoming challenges in data alignment and semantic drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendations often ignore varied information sources like review text, focusing only on interaction-driven latent variables, limiting the understanding of user motivations.

Method: LMMRec integrates large language models using chain-of-thought prompting to extract motivations from text, employing a dual-encoder for alignment and strategies like contrastive learning to reduce noise.

Result: LMMRec demonstrates superior performance, improving recommendation accuracy by up to 4.98% across three datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures multimodal user motivations, enhancing recommendation systems while addressing alignment and noise challenges.

Abstract: Motivation-based recommendation systems uncover user behavior drivers. Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates. Experiments on three datasets show LMMRec achieves up to a 4.98\% performance improvement.

### [501] [Scaling Laws for Embedding Dimension in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05062)
*Julian Killingback,Mahta Rafiee,Madine Manas,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how embedding dimensions influence dense retrieval performance. It identifies scaling laws between embedding size and retrieval outcomes, noting diminishing returns for aligned tasks and performance degradation for non-aligned tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations of dense retrieval systems using embeddings and inner-products, and to understand the impact of embedding dimensions on effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: The authors conducted comprehensive experiments with diverse model families and sizes, deriving scaling laws for retrieval performance concerning embedding dimensions and their interactions with model size.

Result: The performance showed predictable improvements following a power law with larger embedding sizes for aligned tasks, but unpredictable results and degradation for tasks less aligned with the training objectives.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-offs in embedding dimension selection, offering practical guidance on achieving optimal performance while minimizing storage and computation costs.

Abstract: Dense retrieval, which encodes queries and documents into a single dense vector, has become the dominant neural retrieval approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.

*Niall McCarroll,Kevin Curran,Eugene McNamee,Angela Clist,Andrew Brammer*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic search by employing Word Mover's Distance (WMD) with GloVe embeddings for improving query similarity measurements, achieving better performance than other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the understanding and representation of complex language and semantic relationships for better search and retrieval accuracy in Information Retrieval systems.

Method: The study integrates Word Mover's Distance with neural word embeddings (like GloVe) to assess semantic similarity between query statements by comparing distances between individual words, moving beyond centroid-based measures.

Result: The combination of WMD and GloVe embeddings demonstrates significant accuracy improvements in similarity ranking, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as Doc2Vec and baseline methods like LSA.

Conclusion: WMD combined with pre-trained word embeddings offers a robust, domain-agnostic solution for semantic similarity tasks in Information Retrieval, with improved ranking accuracy and cross-domain adaptability.

Abstract: Search behaviour is characterised using synonymy and polysemy as users often want to search information based on meaning. Semantic representation strategies represent a move towards richer associative connections that can adequately capture this complex usage of language. Vector Space Modelling (VSM) and neural word embeddings play a crucial role in modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Embeddings use distributional semantics to represent words, sentences, paragraphs or entire documents as vectors in high dimensional spaces. This can be leveraged by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to exploit the semantic relatedness between queries and answers.
  This paper evaluates an alternative approach to measuring query statement similarity that moves away from the common similarity measure of centroids of neural word embeddings. Motivated by the Word Movers Distance (WMD) model, similarity is evaluated using the distance between individual words of queries and statements. Results from ranked query and response statements demonstrate significant gains in accuracy using the combined approach of similarity ranking through WMD with the word embedding techniques. The top performing WMD + GloVe combination outperforms all other state-of-the-art retrieval models including Doc2Vec and the baseline LSA model. Along with the significant gains in performance of similarity ranking through WMD, we conclude that the use of pre-trained word embeddings, trained on vast amounts of data, result in domain agnostic language processing solutions that are portable to diverse business use-cases.

### [503] [Graph--Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04943)
*Mahmud Ashraf Shamim,Moshiur Rahman,Mohamed Hibat-Allah,Paulo T Araujo*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies the phase structure of wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets by introducing a Hilbert graph (HG) representation and linking phase reconstruction to a classical combinatorial optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically characterize the phase structure of wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets, a problem that has previously eluded complete understanding.

Method: The authors represent the Hilbert space as a weighted graph (Hilbert graph) and transform the phase reconstruction problem into a classical Ising antiferromagnet problem on this graph.

Result: Phase reconstruction in Heisenberg antiferromagnets is shown to be equivalent to solving a weighted Max-Cut problem, establishing its worst-case NP-hard complexity.

Conclusion: The study links the phase structure in Heisenberg antiferromagnets to combinatorial optimization, providing a novel perspective on an enduring challenge in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.

*Luis Cunha,Jose Martins,Manuel Rodriguez,Tiago Gomes,Sandro Pinto,Uwe Moslehner,Kai Dieffenbach,Glenn Farrall,Kajetan Nuernberger,Thomas Roecker*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes RISC-V hardware isolation primitives (RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, SmMTT) in heterogeneous SoCs for mixed-criticality environments, implements and evaluates them, and suggests modifications for better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enforcing system-level isolation in heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) for mixed-criticality environments, particularly considering the evolving RISC-V ecosystem and constraints like Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C).

Method: The authors implemented and evaluated three isolation primitives (IOPMP, World-based checker, and an improved RISC-V World checker) in practical SoC designs, focusing on security guarantees, power, performance, and area trade-offs.

Result: The results show that the modified World-based checker achieves lower worst-case delays with predictable scalability and reduces SoC area by up to 5% compared to baseline designs.

Conclusion: The work proposes improvements to RISC-V isolation mechanisms that enhance performance and efficiency, likely influencing future RISC-V specifications and SoC designs. All findings and artifacts will be open sourced.

Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.

*Clément Pierquin,Aurélien Bellet,Marc Tommasi,Matthieu Boussard*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies privacy amplification via synthetic data release, showing improved differential privacy guarantees by introducing a method unaffected by the number of synthetic records released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve the practical relevance of privacy amplification mechanisms through synthetic data generation, breaking limitations of previous asymptotic models.

Method: The authors introduce a bounded-parameter assumption to analyze privacy amplification for synthetic data release, diverging from prior asymptotic-only models.

Result: The findings reveal that privacy amplification holds even when an unbounded number of synthetic records are released, surpassing previous results.

Conclusion: The results offer insights to develop stronger privacy guarantees for complex mechanisms, advancing the field of privacy amplification.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.

TL;DR: This paper investigates GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) by analyzing their review processes and identifying key delays and patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub Security Advisories play a critical role in open-source vulnerability management, but the review mechanism is not well-understood.

Method: An empirical study analyzing over 288,000 advisories (2019–2025), characterizing review likelihoods, delays, and introducing a queueing model.

Result: Identifies two latency regimes in the review process: a fast path linked to GitHub Repository Advisories and a slow path linked to NVD-first advisories.

Conclusion: Understanding GHSA review processes and delays enables more efficient advisory management, highlighting the importance of the advisory pipeline structure.

Abstract: GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) have become a central component of open-source vulnerability disclosure and are widely used by developers and security tools. A distinctive feature of GHSA is that only a fraction of advisories are reviewed by GitHub, while the mechanisms associated with this review process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of GHSA review processes, analyzing over 288,000 advisories spanning 2019--2025. We characterize which advisories are more likely to be reviewed, quantify review delays, and identify two distinct review-latency regimes: a fast path dominated by GitHub Repository Advisories (GRAs) and a slow path dominated by NVD-first advisories. We further develop a queueing model that accounts for this dichotomy based on the structure of the advisory processing pipeline.

### [507] [Beware Untrusted Simulators -- Reward-Free Backdoor Attacks in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05089)
*Ethan Rathbun,Wo Wei Lin,Alina Oprea,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a threat where simulator dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL) can be exploited to stealthily implant backdoors, allowing adversaries to trigger targeted actions in RL agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulators are critical for RL but can serve as entry points for adversaries to manipulate agent behavior, potentially causing significant harm in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose 'Daze,' an attack that stealthily implants backdoors into RL agents without altering or observing their reward streams. They provide formal proofs and empirical tests on various RL domains.

Result: The attack is effective across discrete and continuous RL tasks, with real-world transfer demonstrated on robotic hardware.

Conclusion: These findings emphasize the need for robust security measures across all aspects of RL training pipelines to mitigate potential risks from malicious actors.

Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.

*Heajun An,Connor Ng,Sandesh Sharma Dulal,Junghwan Kim,Jin-Hee Cho*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VEXA, a framework generating adaptable and evidence-based explanations for scam detection enhanced by AI, improving clarity and reliability for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of online scams and generative AI prompts better explanatory tools to assist non-experts in identifying scams effectively.

Method: The framework integrates GradientSHAP-based attribution with user vulnerability personas to develop context-aware and evidence-grounded explanations.

Result: Tests on multi-channel datasets demonstrated improved semantic reliability in explanations and interpretability due to persona adaptation without undermining alignment to evidential data.

Conclusion: VEXA offers an effective approach to generate trustworthy and user-adaptive explanations for scam detection, emphasizing the balance between evidence-grounded reliability and stylistic flexibility.

Abstract: Online scams across email, short message services, and social media increasingly challenge everyday risk assessment, particularly as generative AI enables more fluent and context-aware deception. Although transformer-based detectors achieve strong predictive performance, their explanations are often opaque to non-experts or misaligned with model decisions. We propose VEXA, an evidence-grounded and persona-adaptive framework for generating learner-facing scam explanations by integrating GradientSHAP-based attribution with theory-informed vulnerability personas. Evaluation across multi-channel datasets shows that grounding explanations in detector-derived evidence improves semantic reliability without increasing linguistic complexity, while persona conditioning introduces interpretable stylistic variation without disrupting evidential alignment. These results reveal a key design insight: evidential grounding governs semantic correctness, whereas persona-based adaptation operates at the level of presentation under constraints of faithfulness. Together, VEXA demonstrates the feasibility of persona-adaptive, evidence-grounded explanations and provides design guidance for trustworthy, learner-facing security explanations in non-formal contexts.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in code generated by LLMs through recurring templates and introduces 'Feature--Security Table (FSTab)' that predicts vulnerabilities based on frontend features without backend code access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing security risks in LLM-generated software due to recurring templates that lead to predictable vulnerabilities.

Method: Introduced FSTab, which facilitates black-box attacks and model-centric evaluations to analyze vulnerability persistence across programs and domains.

Result: FSTab achieved high success rates in predicting vulnerabilities, including 94% attack success and 93% vulnerability coverage, even for unseen application domains.

Conclusion: LLM-generated software presents a significant security risk due to predictable vulnerabilities, necessitating scrutiny of code-generation models.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation.

*Chen Xiong,Zhiyuan He,Pin-Yu Chen,Ching-Yun Ko,Tsung-Yi Ho*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Activation steering, used for LLM alignment without retraining, can unintentionally weaken safety measures and increase vulnerability to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the behavioral alignment of LLMs post-training for objectives like compliance or adherence without retraining.

Method: Adding a steering vector to a model's internal representations to influence specific behaviors.

Result: Experiments showed steering vectors could increase attack vulnerability in LLMs by over 80%, exposing safety weaknesses.

Conclusion: The technique raises unanticipated risks by eroding safety margins, highlighting the need for rigorous auditing before deployment.

Abstract: Activation steering is a practical post-training model alignment technique to enhance the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs). Prior to deploying a model as a service, developers can steer a pre-trained model toward specific behavioral objectives, such as compliance or instruction adherence, without the need for retraining. This process is as simple as adding a steering vector to the model's internal representations. However, this capability unintentionally introduces critical and under-explored safety risks. We identify a phenomenon termed Steering Externalities, where steering vectors derived from entirely benign datasets-such as those enforcing strict compliance or specific output formats like JSON-inadvertently erode safety guardrails. Experiments reveal that these interventions act as a force multiplier, creating new vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and increasing attack success rates to over 80% on standard benchmarks by bypassing the initial safety alignment. Ultimately, our results expose a critical blind spot in deployment: benign activation steering systematically erodes the "safety margin," rendering models more vulnerable to black-box attacks and proving that inference-time utility improvements must be rigorously audited for unintended safety externalities.

*Tianxin Chen,Wenbo Jiang,Hongqiao Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Semantic-level Backdoor Attack (SemBD) approach for text-to-image diffusion models, addressing vulnerabilities in current methods by using semantic region triggers and advanced editing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings of existing backdoor attacks, which use fixed triggers and single-entity targets, making them vulnerable to input defenses and detection methods.

Method: SemBD employs key-value projection editing in cross-attention layers to implant semantic backdoors, utilizing semantic regularization and multi-entity targets for stealthiness.

Result: SemBD achieves a 100% attack success rate and robust performance against state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of SemBD in conducting backdoor attacks on T2I models, introducing a new attack paradigm with semantic-level triggers.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely adopted for their strong generative capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks typically rely on fixed textual triggers and single-entity backdoor targets, making them highly susceptible to enumeration-based input defenses and attention-consistency detection. In this work, we propose Semantic-level Backdoor Attack (SemBD), which implants backdoors at the representation level by defining triggers as continuous semantic regions rather than discrete textual patterns. Concretely, SemBD injects semantic backdoors by distillation-based editing of the key and value projection matrices in cross-attention layers, enabling diverse prompts with identical semantic compositions to reliably activate the backdoor attack. To further enhance stealthiness, SemBD incorporates a semantic regularization to prevent unintended activation under incomplete semantics, as well as multi-entity backdoor targets that avoid highly consistent cross-attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemBD achieves a 100% attack success rate while maintaining strong robustness against state-of-the-art input-level defenses.

*Andrew Draganov,Tolga H. Dur,Anandmayi Bhongade,Mary Phuong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a sophisticated data poisoning attack, Phantom Transfer, which cannot be countered using traditional filtering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to understand and address advanced data poisoning methods that can bypass filters and compromise machine learning models.

Method: The authors modify subliminal learning for real-world applications, demonstrating that the attack works across various models, including GPT-4.1.

Result: The attack remains effective even when dataset samples are fully paraphrased or reprocessed, revealing vulnerabilities in data-level defences.

Conclusion: Data-level defences are insufficient; focus should shift to model audits and white-box security approaches for securing ML systems.

Abstract: We present a data poisoning attack -- Phantom Transfer -- with the property that, even if you know precisely how the poison was placed into an otherwise benign dataset, you cannot filter it out. We achieve this by modifying subliminal learning to work in real-world contexts and demonstrate that the attack works across models, including GPT-4.1. Indeed, even fully paraphrasing every sample in the dataset using a different model does not stop the attack. We also discuss connections to steering vectors and show that one can plant password-triggered behaviours into models while still beating defences.
  This suggests that data-level defences are insufficient for stopping sophisticated data poisoning attacks. We suggest that future work should focus on model audits and white-box security methods.

*Gautam Savaliya,Robert Aufschläger,Abhishek Subedi,Michael Heigl,Martin Schramm*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PriMod4AI is a hybrid privacy threat modeling framework for AI systems, combining classical threats from LINDDUN and AI-specific threats, leveraging both a vector database and LLM-guided analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical privacy threat models (LINDDUN) in handling AI-specific privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion.

Method: The authors integrate two structured knowledge bases (LINDDUN taxonomy and AI-centric privacy attack knowledge) into a vector database for semantic retrieval. They use Data Flow metadata to generate prompts for large language models (LLMs) to identify, explain, and categorize threats.

Result: Evaluation on two AI systems showed that PriMod4AI covers classical privacy categories while effectively addressing AI-specific model-centric threats with consistent results across LLMs.

Conclusion: PriMod4AI provides a comprehensive, taxonomy-grounded method for privacy threat modeling across AI lifecycle stages, ensuring broader and detailed threat identification.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems introduce complex privacy risks throughout their lifecycle, especially when processing sensitive or high-dimensional data. Beyond the seven traditional privacy threat categories defined by the LINDDUN framework, AI systems are also exposed to model-centric privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion, which LINDDUN does not cover. To address both classical LINDDUN threats and additional AI-driven privacy attacks, PriMod4AI introduces a hybrid privacy threat modeling approach that unifies two structured knowledge sources, a LINDDUN knowledge base representing the established taxonomy, and a model-centric privacy attack knowledge base capturing threats outside LINDDUN. These knowledge bases are embedded into a vector database for semantic retrieval and combined with system level metadata derived from Data Flow Diagram. PriMod4AI uses retrieval-augmented and Data Flow specific prompt generation to guide large language models (LLMs) in identifying, explaining, and categorizing privacy threats across lifecycle stages. The framework produces justified and taxonomy-grounded threat assessments that integrate both classical and AI-driven perspectives. Evaluation on two AI systems indicates that PriMod4AI provides broad coverage of classical privacy categories while additionally identifying model-centric privacy threats. The framework produces consistent, knowledge-grounded outputs across LLMs, as reflected in agreement scores in the observed range.

*Joachim Schaeffer,Arjun Khandelwal,Tyler Tracy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies how AI systems might subvert monitoring by selectively optimizing attack strategies, reducing safety under certain constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the potential threat posed by AI systems creating strategic attacks to avoid detection in monitored environments and identify weaknesses in current safety evaluation methods.

Method: The authors studied attack selection in the BigCodeBench setting, leveraging classification approaches to analyze how AI-generated attack policies could bypass monitors by mapping attacks to quality scores and determining submission probabilities.

Result: The study shows that AI systems that reason about the monitor and select attacks cautiously can significantly reduce safety levels from 99% to 59% with a constrained auditing budget of 0.5%.

Conclusion: Understanding and eliciting AI attack selection capabilities is crucial to improving realistic safety assessments and developing effective control measures.

Abstract: Future AI deployments will likely be monitored for malicious behaviour. The ability of these AIs to subvert monitors by adversarially selecting against them - attack selection - is particularly concerning. To study this, we let a red team create attack policies that attempt to insert attacks into code without being caught by a monitor in the concentrated BigCodeBench backdooring setting. We decompose attack selection into two problems: mapping attacks to a quality score and mapping quality scores to submission probabilities. We frame attack selection as a classification problem and show that safety is significantly more sensitive to FPR than TPR. We find that prompting the attacker model to reason about the monitor while being cautious with attack selection reduces safety from a baseline of 99% to 59% at 0.5% auditing budget, emphasizing that eliciting attack selection capabilities of models is vital to avoid overly optimistic safety scores in control evaluations.

### [515] [Do Vision-Language Models Respect Contextual Integrity in Location Disclosure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05023)
*Ruixin Yang,Ethan Mendes,Arthur Wang,James Hays,Sauvik Das,Wei Xu,Alan Ritter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper highlights privacy risks in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to their precise image geolocation capabilities. It introduces a benchmark, VLM-GEOPRIVACY, to evaluate models' contextual privacy reasoning and finds current models poorly aligned with human privacy expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the privacy concerns caused by VLMs accurately inferring sensitive locations from photos, going beyond the level of detail consented by users. A better balance between privacy and utility is needed.

Method: The authors propose a contextual approach to VLM geolocation rather than a blanket restriction, introducing VLM-GEOPRIVACY as a benchmark to evaluate models against human-aligned contextual privacy reasoning.

Result: The study evaluated 14 VLMs and found that while precise geolocation is possible, they often fail to meet human privacy expectations, over-disclosing sensitive information and being vulnerable to prompt-based attacks.

Conclusion: Innovative design principles are required in VLMs to incorporate context-aware privacy reasoning, demonstrating respect for social norms and protecting user privacy appropriately.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.

### [516] [Bypassing AI Control Protocols via Agent-as-a-Proxy Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05066)
*Jafar Isbarov,Murat Kantarcioglu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies the vulnerability of current AI Agent monitoring-based defenses to a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack that bypasses both agents and monitors, proving weaknesses regardless of the monitor's scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the effectiveness and frailty of monitoring-based defenses in AI agents and to uncover the potential bypass strategies that attackers could employ.

Method: The authors introduce a novel attacking approach called Agent-as-a-Proxy attack and test its success against various monitors and language models using the AgentDojo benchmark.

Result: The results reveal that even state-of-the-art large-scale monitoring models, such as Qwen2.5-72B, are susceptible to bypasses by agents with comparable capabilities. High attack success rates were achieved on the benchmark.

Conclusion: Monitoring-based defenses for AI agents are inherently fragile and inadequate to prevent indirect prompt injection attacks, necessitating the design of more robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: As AI agents automate critical workloads, they remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Current defenses rely on monitoring protocols that jointly evaluate an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool-use actions to ensure alignment with user intent. We demonstrate that these monitoring-based defenses can be bypassed via a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack, where prompt injection attacks treat the agent as a delivery mechanism, bypassing both agent and monitor simultaneously. While prior work on scalable oversight has focused on whether small monitors can supervise large agents, we show that even frontier-scale monitors are vulnerable. Large-scale monitoring models like Qwen2.5-72B can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities, such as GPT-4o mini and Llama-3.1-70B. On the AgentDojo benchmark, we achieve a high attack success rate against AlignmentCheck and Extract-and-Evaluate monitors under diverse monitoring LLMs. Our findings suggest current monitoring-based agentic defenses are fundamentally fragile regardless of model scale.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents Spider-Sense, a framework for making large language model agents intrinsically secure via an event-driven defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing increasing security challenges as large language models evolve into autonomous agents, and countering limitations of mandatory checking defense mechanisms.

Method: Developed Spider-Sense: an event-driven, risk-sensing defense framework that activates hierarchical defenses only when risks are detected, balancing efficiency and precision.

Result: Spider-Sense outperforms in defense performance by achieving the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) with just an 8.3% latency overhead.

Conclusion: Spider-Sense effectively enhances the security of autonomous language model agents with minimal performance trade-offs by adopting intrinsic, selective defenses.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, their real-world applicability has expanded significantly, accompanied by new security challenges. Most existing agent defense mechanisms adopt a mandatory checking paradigm, in which security validation is forcibly triggered at predefined stages of the agent lifecycle. In this work, we argue that effective agent security should be intrinsic and selective rather than architecturally decoupled and mandatory. We propose Spider-Sense framework, an event-driven defense framework based on Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS), which allows agents to maintain latent vigilance and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, the Spider-Sense invokes a hierarchical defence mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: it resolves known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning, thereby eliminating reliance on external models. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce S$^2$Bench, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring realistic tool execution and multi-stage attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spider-Sense achieves competitive or superior defense performance, attaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), with only a marginal latency overhead of 8.3\%.

*Mayank Kumar,Qian Lou,Paulo Barreto,Martine De Cock,Sikha Pentyala*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces FHAIM, a framework for generating synthetic data using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) while keeping sensitive data encrypted and ensuring privacy through differential privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of making AI more effective by unlocking valuable data silos, especially in regulated domains like healthcare, education, and finance, through privacy-preserving synthetic data generation.

Method: The authors developed FHAIM by adapting the AIM algorithm to work with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Novel FHE protocols were introduced to generate synthetic tabular data while keeping the original data encrypted and ensuring differential privacy.

Result: FHAIM effectively maintains the performance of the AIM algorithm while achieving feasible runtimes, despite operating in the FHE setting.

Conclusion: FHAIM provides a secure and privacy-preserving method for synthetic data generation, demonstrating potential for wider adoption of AI in sensitive, regulated domains.

Abstract: Data is the lifeblood of AI, yet much of the most valuable data remains locked in silos due to privacy and regulations. As a result, AI remains heavily underutilized in many of the most important domains, including healthcare, education, and finance. Synthetic data generation (SDG), i.e. the generation of artificial data with a synthesizer trained on real data, offers an appealing solution to make data available while mitigating privacy concerns, however existing SDG-as-a-service workflow require data holders to trust providers with access to private data.We propose FHAIM, the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) framework for training a marginal-based synthetic data generator on encrypted tabular data. FHAIM adapts the widely used AIM algorithm to the FHE setting using novel FHE protocols, ensuring that the private data remains encrypted throughout and is released only with differential privacy guarantees. Our empirical analysis show that FHAIM preserves the performance of AIM while maintaining feasible runtimes.

*Enrique Feito-Casares,Francisco M. Melgarejo-Meseguer,Elena Casiraghi,Giorgio Valentini,José-Luis Rojo-Álvarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interpretable pipeline for visualizing IoT network states using low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional Graph Neural Network embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoT network monitoring tools fail to adequately capture dynamic relationships and dependencies due to static and opaque representations, making them unsuitable for security-critical operations.

Method: A pipeline is proposed to map high-dimensional embeddings from Graph Neural Networks onto a latent manifold to enable visualizable and interpretable representations, along with integrated feature attribution techniques.

Result: The framework achieved a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection and successfully identified phenomena such as concept drift, improving security insights.

Conclusion: The approach makes GNN embeddings more interpretable and actionable for IoT network monitoring and security analysis, bridging the gap between complex data and human understanding.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.

*Shayan Abrar,Samura Rahman,Ishrat Jahan Momo,Mahjabin Tasnim Samiha,B. M. Shahria Alam,Mohammad Tahmid Noor,Nishat Tasnim Niloy*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transfer learning-based framework using DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images related to PCOS and achieves high accuracy with interpretability enabled by XAI approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting PCOS early is essential due to its long-term complications like infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks, prompting the need for an automated diagnosis system for ovarian ultrasound images.

Method: The authors utilized DenseNet201 and ResNet50 models using MixUp and CutMix augmentation on a dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images, alongside interpretability tools such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME.

Result: The system achieved a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% with DenseNet201 and detailed visual reasoning for model behavior using XAI techniques.

Conclusion: This paper presents an accurate and interpretable automated system for diagnosing medical images related to PCOS, applicable in clinical settings with confidence and effectiveness.

Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by a hormonal imbalance, irregular periods, and multiple ovarian cysts. Infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks are long-term complications that make early detection essential. In this paper, we design a powerful framework based on transfer learning utilizing DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images. The model was trained on an online dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images of cyst-infected and non-infected patients. Each ultrasound frame was resized to 224x224 pixels and encoded with precise pathological indicators. The MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies were used to improve generalization, yielding a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% by Densenet201 and a validation loss of 0.617 with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4, respectively. We evaluated the model's interpretability using leading Explainable AI (XAI) approaches such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME, reasoning with and presenting explicit visual reasons for the model's behaviors, therefore increasing the model's transparency. This study proposes an automated system for medical picture diagnosis that may be used effectively and confidently in clinical practice.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores the usage of MR-Linac images and AI to detect treatment-induced changes during radiotherapy with high accuracy, outperforming radiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of routinely acquired MR-Linac images and AI-based models for identifying subtle treatment-induced changes during radiotherapy over short intervals.

Method: Using a retrospective dataset of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients, a deep learning model was trained to predict the temporal order of fraction-paired images. The model's results were validated using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), comparison with a radiologist's performance, saliency map evaluations, ablation testing, and expert evaluations.

Result: The model achieved an AUC of 0.99 (first-last fractions) and 0.97 (all fraction pairs), significantly outperforming radiologist accuracy. The primary predictive regions were the prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis, identifying radiation-induced changes.

Conclusion: AI models can accurately detect and characterize radiotherapy-induced changes in MR-Linac fractions, emphasizing MR-Linac's potential for advanced radiotherapy image analysis.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether routinely acquired longitudinal MR-Linac images can be leveraged to characterize treatment-induced changes during radiotherapy, particularly subtle inter-fraction changes over short intervals (average of 2 days). Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a series of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. An artificial intelligence (deep learning) model was used to characterize treatment-induced changes by predicting the temporal order of paired images. The model was first trained with the images from the first and the last fractions (F1-FL), then with all pairs (All-pairs). Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), compared to a radiologist's performance, and qualitative analyses - the saliency map evaluation to investigate affected anatomical regions. Input ablation experiments were performed to identify the anatomical regions altered by radiotherapy. The radiologist conducted an additional task on partial images reconstructed by saliency map regions, reporting observations as well. Quantitative image analysis was conducted to investigate the results from the model and the radiologist. Results: The F1-FL model yielded near-perfect performance (AUC of 0.99), significantly outperforming the radiologist. The All-pairs model yielded an AUC of 0.97. This performance reflects therapy-induced changes, supported by the performance correlation to fraction intervals, ablation tests and expert's interpretation. Primary regions driving the predictions were prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Conclusion: The model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over one or a few days, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations confirmed by experts. This underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance.

*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Taufiq Hasan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel model, the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble), which achieves state-of-the-art performance in automated ROP screening using limited public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of automated ROP screening caused by limited data and the need for clinically informed reasoning in detecting structural and microvascular abnormalities.

Method: The CAA Ensemble consists of two specialized streams: MS-AQNet for structural localization and VascuMIL for vascular characterization, with a meta-learner combining these cues for diagnostics.

Result: The model achieved a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 in ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection, demonstrating strong performance even on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the medical AI data gap through architectural inductive bias and provides explainability with transparent clinical reasoning via attention heatmaps and vascular maps.

Abstract: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is among the major causes of preventable childhood blindness. Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search. Additionally, this study demonstrates that architectural inductive bias can serve as an effective bridge for the medical AI data gap.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using cross-modal MRI-CT analysis for liver tumour detection, highlighting limitations when pathological features are invisible in CT images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the difficulty of detecting liver tumours that are visible in MRI but invisible in CT during surgeries due to minimal tissue contrast.

Method: A hybrid registration-segmentation framework combining MSCGUNet for inter-modal registration and a UNet-based module for segmentation, producing pseudo-labels for CT images.

Result: When tested, the framework achieved a Dice score of 0.72 for registering and segmenting healthy liver anatomy, but performed poorly (Dice score 0.16) for tumours due to invisible pathological features in CT.

Conclusion: Registration-based label transfer is effective for visible structures but cannot handle absent discriminative features in cross-modal scenarios, pointing to key challenges in this research domain.

Abstract: Liver tumour ablation presents a significant clinical challenge: whilst tumours are clearly visible on pre-operative MRI, they are often effectively invisible on intra-operative CT due to minimal contrast between pathological and healthy tissue. This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the "domain gap" and "feature absence" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

TL;DR: This study proposes a disc-specific method for automated lumbar spinal stenosis grading using MRI, combining contrastive pretraining and fine-tuning to improve accuracy and reduce misclassification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis from MRI is challenging due to the need for precise severity grading and the impact of image variability.

Method: The paper employs contrastive learning for meaningful feature extraction, disc-level fine-tuning, an auxiliary regression task for disc localization, and weighted focal loss to manage class imbalance.

Result: The proposed method achieved 78.1% balanced accuracy and reduced severe-to-normal misclassification to 2.13%, outperforming basic supervised training approaches.

Conclusion: Focusing on disc-specific features proves effective in assessing lumbar spinal stenosis, despite difficulties in identifying moderate severity cases.

Abstract: This work examines a disc-centric approach for automated severity grading of lumbar spinal stenosis from sagittal T2-weighted MRI. The method combines contrastive pretraining with disc-level fine-tuning, using a single anatomically localized region of interest per intervertebral disc. Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch. Detecting discs with moderate severity can still be challenging, but focusing on disc-level features provides a practical way to assess the lumbar spinal stenosis.

*Alina Harbuzova,Or Ordentlich,Yury Polyanskiy*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper explores an optimal matrix quantization method for efficient deployment of LLMs, proving the existence of a universal codebook near-optimal for all input statistics, although the proof is non-constructive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of modern LLMs by optimizing weight quantization in a way that is universally effective across varying input data statistics.

Method: The authors leverage information theory and vector quantization principles. They mathematically demonstrate the existence of a universal codebook through theoretical proofs, showing that it can adapt uniformly to all PCA directions of input data, with a minimal performance tradeoff.

Result: The study shows existence of a universal, near-optimal codebook for weight quantization, reducing complexity in adapting to input statistics.

Conclusion: A universally adaptable codebook can revolutionize low-precision storage in LLMs, but its construction remains an open challenge as the existence proof is not constructive.

Abstract: Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ ("weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as "waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.
  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.

*Max Firmbach,Malachi Phillips,Christian Glusa,Alexander Popp,Christopher M. Siefert,Matthias Mayr*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a material-aware coarsening method for algebraic multigrid systems to robustly handle problems with heterogeneous material properties and anisotropies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical strength-of-connection measures fail to account for weak couplings across material interfaces or anisotropies, leading to poor convergence. The need is to improve the robustness of multigrid methods for problems with complex material properties.

Method: The method incorporates material tensor information directly into the coarsening process, ensuring that weak connections across material interfaces and anisotropies are detected effectively. This enables preserving the true problem structure on coarse levels.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robustness in academic tests and real-world applications like thermally activated batteries and solar cells, handling material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations consistently.

Conclusion: The approach improves the efficiency and scalability of multigrid methods for complex, large-scale problems and is suited for high-performance computing environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a material-aware strength-of-connection measure for smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid methods, aimed at improving robustness for scalar partial differential equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties. Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces sMoE U-Net, enhancing edge detection transparency using interpretable logic while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in deep learning models used for edge detection, particularly in safety-critical applications.

Method: Introduced sMoE U-Net with Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts blocks and a TSK Fuzzy Head for transparency and performance enhancement.

Result: Achieved 0.7628 ODS F-score on BSDS500 benchmark, matching high-performing baselines and outperforming standard U-Net.

Conclusion: sMoE U-Net balances performance and interpretability, offering pixel-level explainability tools for edge detection applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models like U-Net and its variants, have established state-of-the-art performance in edge detection tasks and are used by Generative AI services world-wide for their image generation models. However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between "Context" (smooth) and "Boundary" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437). Crucially, our model provides pixel-level explainability through "Rule Firing Maps" and "Strategy Maps," allowing users to visualize whether an edge was detected due to strong gradients, high semantic confidence, or specific logical rule combinations.

*Freja Høgholm Petersen,Jesper Sandvig Mariegaard,Rocco Palmitessa,Allan P. Engsig-Karup*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Koopman autoencoder for coastal-ocean modelling, comparing it with traditional POD-based surrogates. It achieves better accuracy, fast inference speeds, and reliable long-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited application of Koopman autoencoders in real-world coastal-ocean modeling and the need for faster, accurate prediction models motivated this study.

Method: The authors developed a Koopman autoencoder incorporating meteorological and boundary conditions. It uses a learned linear temporal operator with eigenvalue regularization and temporal unrolling techniques.

Result: The Koopman autoencoder achieved high prediction accuracy across various test cases, with relative errors of 0.01-0.13 and inference speeds 300-1400x faster than physics-based models.

Conclusion: The strategy enables practical error levels in water elevation prediction with significant speed-ups, making it suitable for applications like ensemble forecasting and climate simulations.

Abstract: While POD-based surrogates are widely explored for hydrodynamic applications, the use of Koopman Autoencoders for real-world coastal-ocean modelling remains relatively limited. This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling.

*László Györfi,Pierre Humbert,Batiste Le Bars*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces estimators for Fréchet mean and conditional Fréchet mean for data in separable metric spaces using quantization techniques, and proves their universal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating Fréchet and conditional Fréchet means in separable metric spaces poses challenges due to lack of universal methods for such spaces, unlike Euclidean spaces.

Method: Introduces a computable estimator for Fréchet mean using random quantization and another estimator for conditional Fréchet mean using data-driven partitioning and quantization methods.

Result: Both estimators are shown to achieve universal consistency across separable metric spaces and Banach spaces for various data types.

Conclusion: The proposed estimators provide practical, universally consistent methods for mean estimation in separable metric and Banach spaces.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the Fréchet and conditional Fréchet mean from data taking values in separable metric spaces. Unlike Euclidean spaces, where well-established methods are available, there is no practical estimator that works universally for all metric spaces. Therefore, we introduce a computable estimator for the Fréchet mean based on random quantization techniques and establish its universal consistency across any separable metric spaces. Additionally, we propose another estimator for the conditional Fréchet mean, leveraging data-driven partitioning and quantization, and demonstrate its universal consistency when the output space is any Banach space.

### [530] [An Asymptotic Law of the Iterated Logarithm for $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05259)
*Ashwin Ram,Aaditya Ramdas*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper focuses on providing a tight law of the iterated logarithm for empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ using very general data assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current nonasymptotic concentration bounds for empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$, particularly for unbounded data and improve their constants, rates, and generality.

Method: The authors derive a tight upper and lower law of the iterated logarithm for the empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$, allowing application to extremely general unbounded data.

Result: A theoretically sound result: precise characterizations of asymptotic fluctuations for empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$, overcoming limitations of existing nonasymptotic bounds.

Conclusion: Tight concentration and fluctuation bounds for empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ have been established, enabling improved design and analysis of bandit algorithms and sequential tests even with unbounded data.

Abstract: The population $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ is a fundamental quantity that appears in lower bounds for (asymptotically) optimal regret of pure-exploration stochastic bandit algorithms, and optimal stopping time of sequential tests. Motivated by this, an empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ statistic is frequently used in the design of (asymptotically) optimal bandit algorithms and sequential tests. While nonasymptotic concentration bounds for the empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ have been developed, their optimality in terms of constants and rates is questionable, and their generality is limited (usually to bounded observations). The fundamental limits of nonasymptotic concentration are often described by the asymptotic fluctuations of the statistics. With that motivation, this paper presents a tight (upper and lower) law of the iterated logarithm for empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ applying to extremely general (unbounded) data.

### [531] [Asymptotically optimal sequential change detection for bounded means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05272)
*Ashwin Ram,Aaditya Ramdas*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses quickest changepoint detection under complexity where pre- and post-change distributions lie in composite families, deriving sharp universal lower and upper bounds for detection delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of detecting changepoints under composite family distributions, where traditional methods fail due to dependency of pre-change law on unknown post-change law.

Method: The authors establish a universal sharp lower bound for detection delay and tight matching upper bounds in specific settings, ensuring their results hold universally and are robust.

Result: They achieved sharp bounds for detection delay under low type-I error and verified achievability for bounded and separated mean scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings advance the understanding and tools for changepoint detection under challenging statistical setups, offering precise and practical solutions for these complex scenarios.

Abstract: We consider the problem of quickest changepoint detection under the Average Run Length (ARL) constraint where the pre-change and post-change laws lie in composite families $\mathscr{P}$ and $\mathscr{Q}$ respectively. In such a problem, a massive challenge is characterizing the best possible detection delay when the "hardest" pre-change law in $\mathscr{P}$ depends on the unknown post-change law $Q\in\mathscr{Q}$. And typical simple-hypothesis likelihood-ratio arguments for Page-CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts do not at all apply here. To that end, we derive a universal sharp lower bound in full generality for any ARL-calibrated changepoint detector in the low type-I error ($γ\to\infty$ regime) of the order $\log(γ)/\mathrm{KL}_{\mathrm{inf}}(Q,\mathscr{P})$. We show achievability of this universal lower bound by proving a tight matching upper bound (with the same sharp $\logγ$ constant) in the important bounded mean detection setting. In addition, for separated mean shifts, we also we derive a uniform minimax guarantee of this achievability over the alternatives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore Sparse Autoencoders as tools for understanding neural representations in audio, an area currently underexplored.

Method: Sparse Autoencoders are trained on encoder layers of Whisper and HuBERT, followed by evaluations for consistency, interpretability, and real-world applications.

Result: More than 50% of features are consistent across random seeds, capturing acoustic/semantic information. SAEs effectively disentangle features, reduce false detections, and align with human EEG activity, preserving reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: SAEs are practical tools for audio feature interpretation and manipulation, supported by their stability, real-world utility, and correlation with human neural activity.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are powerful tools for interpreting neural representations, yet their use in audio remains underexplored. We train SAEs across all encoder layers of Whisper and HuBERT, provide an extensive evaluation of their stability, interpretability, and show their practical utility. Over 50% of the features remain consistent across random seeds, and reconstruction quality is preserved. SAE features capture general acoustic and semantic information as well as specific events, including environmental noises and paralinguistic sounds (e.g. laughter, whispering) and disentangle them effectively, requiring removal of only 19-27% of features to erase a concept. Feature steering reduces Whisper's false speech detections by 70% with negligible WER increase, demonstrating real-world applicability. Finally, we find SAE features correlated with human EEG activity during speech perception, indicating alignment with human neural processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing audio deepfake detection methods, which mainly focus on local features and pairwise relations while overlooking the importance of high-order interactions that can be crucial for understanding discriminative patterns.

Method: The authors propose HyperPotter, a hypergraph-based methodology that uses clustering-based hyperedges and class-aware prototype initialization to effectively capture and utilize high-order interactions for detecting audio deepfakes.

Result: HyperPotter shows significant performance improvement over baseline methods by 22.15% on average across 11 datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 13.96% on cross-domain datasets, proving its superior generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: HyperPotter effectively models high-order interactions, making it a robust and generalized solution for audio deepfake detection, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Advances in AIGC technologies have enabled the synthesis of highly realistic audio deepfakes capable of deceiving human auditory perception. Although numerous audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been developed, most rely on local temporal/spectral features or pairwise relations, overlooking high-order interactions (HOIs). HOIs capture discriminative patterns that emerge from multiple feature components beyond their individual contributions. We propose HyperPotter, a hypergraph-based framework that explicitly models these synergistic HOIs through clustering-based hyperedges with class-aware prototype initialization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperPotter surpasses its baseline by an average relative gain of 22.15% across 11 datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 13.96% on 4 challenging cross-domain datasets, demonstrating superior generalization to diverse attacks and speakers.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper extends the universal approximation theorem to the signatures of rough paths, accounting for non-weakly geometric paths, time extensions, and quadratic variation terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a rigorous universal approximation framework for signatures of rough paths, including those with quadratic variation in stochastic and probabilistic contexts.

Method: By extending paths with additional terms such as time and quadratic variations, and utilizing Föllmer and stochastic integration approaches (e.g., Itô), the authors prove approximation results for continuous functionals.

Result: The paper demonstrates that linear functionals of extended path signatures can approximate continuous functionals uniformly, even for semimartingales or rough paths with extended terms, with applications in finance.

Conclusion: The extended signature method improves universal approximations and has practical implications, especially for stochastic processes in model calibration and option pricing.

Abstract: We establish a universal approximation theorem for signatures of rough paths that are not necessarily weakly geometric. By extending the path with time and its rough path bracket terms, we prove that linear functionals of the signature of the resulting rough paths approximate continuous functionals on rough path spaces uniformly on compact sets. Moreover, we construct the signature of a path extended by its pathwise quadratic variation terms based on general pathwise stochastic integration à la Föllmer, in particular, allowing for pathwise Itô, Stratonovich, and backward Itô integration. In a probabilistic setting, we obtain a universal approximation result for linear functionals of the signature of continuous semimartingales extended by the quadratic variation terms, defined via stochastic Itô integration. Numerical examples illustrate the use of signatures when the path is extended by time and quadratic variation in the context of model calibration and option pricing in mathematical finance.

### [536] [A Data Driven Structural Decomposition of Dynamic Games via Best Response Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05324)
*Mahdis Rabbani,Navid Mojahed,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper innovates a data-driven way to compute Nash and generalized Nash equilibria in dynamic games by embedding a best-response map offline, simplifying computation while maintaining or approximating equilibrium consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving Nash equilibria in dynamic games face challenges such as tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization problems, and poor numerical conditioning. Current solvers either require full modeling of agent objectives or rely on approximations, which lead to equilibrium inaccuracies.

Method: The paper proposes a reformulation of Nash equilibrium computation using a structural reduction strategy. This involves embedding a pre-computed best-response map as a feasibility constraint, avoiding tightly nested optimization and derivative coupling.

Result: The new approach achieves comparable or better solution quality with lower computational cost and improved constraint satisfaction in a two-player dynamic game inspired by autonomous racing, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven structural reduction method offers an efficient and approximately consistent solution for dynamic games, supported by theoretical proofs and experimental validation.

Abstract: Dynamic games are powerful tools to model multi-agent decision-making, yet computing Nash (generalized Nash) equilibria remains a central challenge in such settings. Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction.

### [537] [Metric Hedonic Games on the Line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05888)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper extends modified fractional hedonic games by introducing a novel model for agents forming coalitions based on value differences, exploring coalition stability and quality with various cost definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of intractability in hedonic games by proposing a succinct utility model and investigating types of coalition stability in natural scenarios.

Method: The study defines agents' costs using distance thresholds or value differences (maximum or average) in coalitions. Stability structures and quality metrics like price of anarchy/stability are analyzed, including limitations on coalition sizes.

Result: Stable coalition structures exist universally in this model, but their characteristics and quality metrics vary significantly based on the specific settings.

Conclusion: The paper uncovers a complex and diverse landscape in coalition formation, showcasing counter-intuitive behaviors and suggesting that metric distances offer valuable insights into coalition stability dynamics.

Abstract: Hedonic games are fundamental models for investigating the formation of coalitions among a set of strategic agents, where every agent has a certain utility for every possible coalition of agents it can be part of. To avoid the intractability of defining exponentially many utilities for all possible coalitions, many variants with succinct representations of the agents' utility functions have been devised and analyzed, e.g., modified fractional hedonic games by Monaco et al. [JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.
  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely.

*Aryan Mikaeili,Or Patashnik,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Daniel Cohen-Or,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in generative models and finds that its frequency components dominate attention, causing issues in multimodal settings. A new method modulates these frequencies, enhancing style transfer without content reference copying.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of positional encodings, specifically RoPE, in multimodal generative models and address unintended reference copying in shared-attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors analyze the frequency characteristics of RoPE to identify its impact on attention mechanisms and propose a method to selectively modulate RoPE frequency bands to balance semantic similarity and positional alignment.

Result: The modulation of RoPE frequencies restores effective shared-attention functionality, enabling proper style transfer with reduced reference content copying in transformer-based diffusion models.

Conclusion: This study resolves unintended copying in generative models by modifying RoPE behavior, achieving controlled style transfer while maintaining meaningful attention interactions.

Abstract: Positional encodings are essential to transformer-based generative models, yet their behavior in multimodal and attention-sharing settings is not fully understood. In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gabor Fields, a method for enhancing Gaussian-based volume rendering through selective frequency filtering and stochastic sampling, offering benefits in rendering performance, ray traversal, and procedural cloud design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-based volume representations are memory-efficient but face challenges in hierarchical construction and smooth transitions between detail levels, limiting their utility.

Method: The authors propose Gabor Fields, leveraging orientation-selective Gabor kernels for continuous frequency filtering and stochastic sampling, alongside its application for procedural cloud rendering.

Result: Gabor Fields enable improved rendering performance by reducing frequency content through primitive pruning and accelerate ray traversal time in single and multiple scattering setups.

Conclusion: The method addresses key limitations of Gaussian-based representations, enhancing scalability, rendering efficiency, and enabling novel applications such as procedural cloud rendering.

Abstract: Gaussian-based representations have enabled efficient physically-based volume rendering at a fraction of the memory cost of regular, discrete, voxel-based distributions. However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings. Furthermore, inspired by procedural volumes, we present an application for efficient design and rendering of procedural clouds as Gabor-noise-modulated Gaussians.

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) on atmospheric blocking events using deep-learning weather models and finds significant SST influence on blocking variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on atmospheric blocking events amidst chaotic internal atmospheric variability is challenging.

Method: The study uses century-long large-ensemble simulations and deep-learning general circulation models to filter atmospheric noise and study SST-forced effects.

Result: The models skillfully replicate blocking climatology and reveal significant SST-driven teleconnections and trends in blocking frequency over Greenland and Europe.

Conclusion: SST variability has a notable impact on blocking frequency, and deep-learning large-ensemble models are effective tools for disentangling forced SST signals from internal atmospheric variability.

Abstract: Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Niño-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.

Main category: hep-ex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to improve the accuracy of PMT waveform reconstruction, crucial for enhancing spatial and energy resolution in physics experiments, while addressing the lack of labeled data for supervised learning methods.

Method: The authors employ a weakly supervised bidirectional conditional diffusion network framework. First, a PE-conditioned diffusion model simulates realistic waveforms from PE sequences to learn overlapping waveform features. These simulated waveforms train a waveform-conditioned diffusion model to refine PE sequence reconstruction.

Result: The method achieved 99% normalized PE-number resolution for 1-5 p.e. and 80% timing resolution of fully supervised models, demonstrating significant efficiency in reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised approach is effective for PMT waveform reconstruction, overcoming the challenges of overlapping signals and label scarcity while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely employed in particle and nuclear physics experiments. The accuracy of PMT waveform reconstruction directly impacts the detector's spatial and energy resolution. A key challenge arises when multiple photons arrive within a few nanoseconds, making it difficult to resolve individual photoelectrons (PEs). Although supervised deep learning methods have surpassed traditional methods in performance, their practical applicability is limited by the lack of ground-truth PE labels in real data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative weakly supervised waveform simulation and reconstruction approach based on a bidirectional conditional diffusion network framework. The method is fully data-driven and requires only raw waveforms and coarse estimates of PE information as input. It first employs a PE-conditioned diffusion model to simulate realistic waveforms from PE sequences, thereby learning the features of overlapping waveforms. Subsequently, these simulated waveforms are used to train a waveform-conditioned diffusion model to reconstruct the PE sequences from waveforms, reinforcing the learning of features of overlapping waveforms. Through iterative refinement between the two conditional diffusion processes, the model progressively improves reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 99% of the normalized PE-number resolution averaged over 1-5 p.e. and 80% of the timing resolution attained by fully supervised learning.

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of integrating ground-robot fleets and AI into public safety urban search operations. It conducted studies with police officers, highlighting challenges and proposing design requirements for effective adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the operational burdens faced by public safety professionals during urban searches and assess how ground-robot fleets and AI technologies can be effectively integrated into their practices.

Method: Focus-group sessions were conducted with eight police officers from five departments in Virginia to gather insights on current challenges and perceptions of ground-robot technology.

Result: Ground robots were identified as tools to alleviate cognitive and physical burdens in areas like workforce partitioning, situational awareness, route planning, and fatigue management. Four design requirements for integrating robots into operations were also outlined.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for deployable, human-centered systems that integrate robot fleets and AI into public safety operations, aiming to enhance efficiency, trust, and operational accountability.

Abstract: Urban searches demand rapid, defensible decisions and sustained physical effort under high cognitive and situational load. Incident commanders must plan, coordinate, and document time-critical operations, while field searchers execute evolving tasks in uncertain environments. With recent advances in technology, ground-robot fleets paired with computer-vision-based situational awareness and LLM-powered interfaces offer the potential to ease these operational burdens. However, no dedicated studies have examined how public safety professionals perceive such technologies or envision their integration into existing practices, risking building technically sophisticated yet impractical solutions. To address this gap, we conducted focus-group sessions with eight police officers across five local departments in Virginia. Our findings show that ground robots could reduce professionals' reliance on paper references, mental calculations, and ad-hoc coordination, alleviating cognitive and physical strain in four key challenge areas: (1) partitioning the workforce across multiple search hypotheses, (2) retaining group awareness and situational awareness, (3) building route planning that fits the lost-person profile, and (4) managing cognitive and physical fatigue under uncertainty. We further identify four design opportunities and requirements for future ground-robot fleet integration in public-safety operations: (1) scalable multi-robot planning and control interfaces, (2) agency-specific route optimization, (3) real-time replanning informed by debrief updates, and (4) vision-assisted cueing that preserves operational trust while reducing cognitive workload. We conclude with design implications for deployable, accountable, and human-centered urban-search support systems

*Alastair Howcroft,Amber Bennett-Weston,Ahmad Khan,Joseff Griffiths,Simon Gay,Jeremy Howick*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study compares AI chatbots with human healthcare professionals on empathy measures, finding AI often rated higher in text-based scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI-based chatbots, particularly using large language models, can outperform human healthcare professionals in empathic responses.

Method: A meta-analysis was performed on 15 studies comparing text-based empathy ratings between AI chatbots using models like ChatGPT-3.5/4 and human healthcare professionals.

Result: Meta-analysis revealed AI chatbots scored significantly higher on empathy, with a standardized mean difference of 0.87 favoring AI.

Conclusion: In text-based interactions, AI chatbots show superior empathy compared to human healthcare professionals, but future research should incorporate direct patient evaluations and explore voice-enabled AI systems.

Abstract: Background: Empathy is widely recognized for improving patient outcomes, including reduced pain and anxiety and improved satisfaction, and its absence can cause harm. Meanwhile, use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots in healthcare is rapidly expanding, with one in five general practitioners using generative AI to assist with tasks such as writing letters. Some studies suggest AI chatbots can outperform human healthcare professionals (HCPs) in empathy, though findings are mixed and lack synthesis.
  Sources of data: We searched multiple databases for studies comparing AI chatbots using large language models with human HCPs on empathy measures. We assessed risk of bias with ROBINS-I and synthesized findings using random-effects meta-analysis where feasible, whilst avoiding double counting.
  Areas of agreement: We identified 15 studies (2023-2024). Thirteen studies reported statistically significantly higher empathy ratings for AI, with only two studies situated in dermatology favouring human responses. Of the 15 studies, 13 provided extractable data and were suitable for pooling. Meta-analysis of those 13 studies, all utilising ChatGPT-3.5/4, showed a standardized mean difference of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.54-1.20) favouring AI (P < .00001), roughly equivalent to a two-point increase on a 10-point scale.
  Areas of controversy: Studies relied on text-based assessments that overlook non-verbal cues and evaluated empathy through proxy raters.
  Growing points: Our findings indicate that, in text-only scenarios, AI chatbots are frequently perceived as more empathic than human HCPs.
  Areas timely for developing research: Future research should validate these findings with direct patient evaluations and assess whether emerging voice-enabled AI systems can deliver similar empathic advantages.

*Eryue Xu,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores privacy-management challenges users face across applications and contexts, proposing AI agent-driven solutions to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digital footprint spread over multiple platforms requires privacy management that is currently overwhelming and manual, prompting the need for comprehensive AI-driven solutions.

Method: 12 semi-structured interviews to identify privacy challenges and a speed-dating survey with 116 participants to evaluate AI agent concepts.

Result: Nine privacy challenges identified; survey highlighted users' preference for AI agents in post-sharing management due to trust in AI's accuracy.

Conclusion: AI agents provide promising tools for enhancing privacy management through automated, comprehensive solutions, especially for post-sharing digital footprint remediation.

Abstract: Managing one's digital footprint is overwhelming, as it spans multiple platforms and involves countless context-dependent decisions. Recent advances in agentic AI offer ways forward by enabling holistic, contextual privacy-enhancing solutions. Building on this potential, we adopted a ''human-as-the-unit'' perspective and investigated users' cross-context privacy challenges through 12 semi-structured interviews. Results reveal that people rely on ad hoc manual strategies while lacking comprehensive privacy controls, highlighting nine privacy-management challenges across applications, temporal contexts, and relationships. To explore solutions, we generated nine AI agent concepts and evaluated them via a speed-dating survey with 116 US participants. The three highest-ranked concepts were all post-sharing management tools with half or full agent autonomy, with users expressing greater trust in AI accuracy than in their own efforts. Our findings highlight a promising design space where users see AI agents bridging the fragments in privacy management, particularly through automated, comprehensive post-sharing remediation of users' digital footprints.

### [545] [Exploring AI-Augmented Sensemaking of Patient-Generated Health Data: A Mixed-Method Study with Healthcare Professionals in Cardiac Risk Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05687)
*Pavithren V S Pakianathan,Rania Islambouli,Diogo Branco,Albrecht Schmidt,Tiago Guerreiro,Jan David Smeddinck*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) to analyze patient-generated health data (PGHD), focusing on enhancing healthcare professionals' (HCPs) understanding through AI-driven summaries and conversational interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenge of integrating vast and diverse patient health data into clinical workflows, while addressing limitations like healthcare professionals' time constraints and data literacy.

Method: A mixed-methods study was conducted using a prototype tool that combined typical data visualization charts, LLM-generated summaries, and an AI conversational interface, within the context of cardiovascular disease risk management.

Result: AI-generated summaries helped HCPs quickly grasp patient data and facilitated in-depth exploration via conversational tools. However, concerns about transparency, privacy, and dependence on AI tools were noted.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that LLM-driven summarization and conversation tools can aid healthcare workflows by improving data accessibility and comprehension, but careful design is needed to address trust and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly generating substantial personal health and lifestyle data, e.g. through wearables and smartphones. While such data could transform preventative care, its integration into clinical practice is hindered by its scale, heterogeneity and the time pressure and data literacy of healthcare professionals (HCPs). We explore how large language models (LLMs) can support sensemaking of patient-generated health data (PGHD) with automated summaries and natural language data exploration. Using cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction as a use case, 16 HCPs reviewed multimodal PGHD in a mixed-methods study with a prototype that integrated common charts, LLM-generated summaries, and a conversational interface. Findings show that AI summaries provided quick overviews that anchored exploration, while conversational interaction supported flexible analysis and bridged data-literacy gaps. However, HCPs raised concerns about transparency, privacy, and overreliance. We contribute empirical insights and sociotechnical design implications for integrating AI-driven summarization and conversation into clinical workflows to support PGHD sensemaking.

### [546] [From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05179)
*Jingyi Zhao,Linxin Yang,Haohua Zhang,Tian Ding*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-based framework that addresses the computational bottleneck of solving large-scale, combinatorial second-stage problems in stochastic programming using a novel parallelization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the difficulty of addressing the computational cost in stochastic programming when second-stage problems involve NP-hard combinatorial models, which has traditionally led to oversimplification.

Method: The authors propose a hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU framework that enables parallel execution of dynamic programming layers and Bellman updates across over 1,000,000 scenarios, optimizing second-stage computations.

Result: The approach achieves nearly linear scaling with scenarios, yielding one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, enabling evaluation of larger scenario sets and producing better stochastic programming solutions.

Conclusion: Full-fidelity integer second-stage models are feasible for large-scale stochastic programming, allowing more realistic optimization and stronger first-stage decision-making.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.

*Kevin Kurian Thomas Vaidyan,Michael P. Friedlander,Ahmet Alacaoglu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The study focuses on analyzing two classical optimization algorithms for convex problems and proves optimal convergence rates under relaxed assumptions, particularly for applications in graph-guided regularizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the restrictive bounded variance assumption in optimization algorithms to enable their application to additively composite convex problems, including those arising in multi-task and federated learning.

Method: The authors analyze the proximal stochastic gradient method and the randomized incremental proximal method while relaxing the bounded variance assumption. They investigate convergence rates under componentwise convexity and smoothness assumptions.

Result: The results demonstrate a convergence rate of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ for both algorithms' last iterate, which is optimal up to logarithmic terms.

Conclusion: The proposed analysis contributes to optimization theory by extending convergence guarantees for more practical use cases, including graph-guided regularizers in advanced machine learning contexts.

Abstract: We analyze two classical algorithms for solving additively composite convex optimization problems where the objective is the sum of a smooth term and a nonsmooth regularizer: proximal stochastic gradient method for a single regularizer; and the randomized incremental proximal method, which uses the proximal operator of a randomly selected function when the regularizer is given as the sum of many nonsmooth functions. We focus on relaxing the bounded variance assumption that is common, yet stringent, for getting last iterate convergence rates. We prove the $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate of convergence for the last iterate of both algorithms under componentwise convexity and smoothness, which is optimal up to log terms. Our results apply directly to graph-guided regularizers that arise in multi-task and federated learning, where the regularizer decomposes as a sum over edges of a collaboration graph.

### [548] [Solving Stochastic Variational Inequalities without the Bounded Variance Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05531)
*Ahmet Alacaoglu,Jun-Hyun Kim*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes algorithms for solving stochastic variational inequalities (VIs) without requiring bounded variance or domain constraints, targeting min-max optimization problems, and achieves state-of-the-art oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for variational inequalities often rely on bounded variance or bounded domain assumptions, which limits their applicability to certain optimization problems, such as bilinear min-max optimization with unbounded constraints.

Method: The authors study monotone VIs and structured nonmonotone VIs solvable via the weak Minty VI, enabling progress in structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems. They achieve results using stochastic oracles even where variance grows with the square of the norm.

Result: The oracle complexity is $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$

Conclusion: This work extends the theoretical capabilities of solving variational inequalities, removing restrictive assumptions such as bounded variance and bounded domains, while maintaining state-of-the-art computational efficiency.

Abstract: We analyze algorithms for solving stochastic variational inequalities (VI) without the bounded variance or bounded domain assumptions, where our main focus is min-max optimization with possibly unbounded constraint sets. We focus on two classes of problems: monotone VIs; and structured nonmonotone VIs that admit a solution to the weak Minty VI. The latter assumption allows us to solve structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems. For both classes of VIs, to make the expected residual norm less than $\varepsilon$, we show an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$, which is the best-known for constrained VIs. In our setting, this complexity had been obtained with the bounded variance assumption in the literature, which is not even satisfied for bilinear min-max problems with an unbounded domain. We obtain this complexity for stochastic oracles whose variance can grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable.

### [549] [Non-Stationary Inventory Control with Lead Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05799)
*Nele H. Amiri,Sean R. Sinclair,Maximiliano Udenio*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses adaptive inventory control for unknown and time-changing demand distributions, proposing algorithms with dynamic regret performance guarantees and highlighting challenges in different inventory models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing inventory control under uncertain, non-stationary demands while bridging the gap in understanding different inventory models' adaptability. The research aims to establish algorithms ensuring robust performance.

Method: The study develops adaptive online algorithms based on base-stock policies, evaluates their performance using dynamic regret, and utilizes theoretical analysis and simulations to validate the algorithms' efficiency across various inventory models.

Result: The study demonstrates a sharp separation in adaptability across inventory models. Backlogging systems and lost-sales models with zero lead time adapt without loss in stationary environments, but positive lead times impose weaker performance guarantees. Simulations confirm the algorithms outperform existing approaches.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust analytical framework and adaptive algorithms for inventory control under non-stationary demand, addressing varying challenges across systems, though limitations persist with lead time.

Abstract: We study non-stationary single-item, periodic-review inventory control problems in which the demand distribution is unknown and may change over time. We analyze how demand non-stationarity affects learning performance across inventory models, including systems with demand backlogging or lost-sales, both with and without lead times. For each setting, we propose an adaptive online algorithm that optimizes over the class of base-stock policies and establish performance guarantees in terms of dynamic regret relative to the optimal base-stock policy at each time step. Our results reveal a sharp separation across inventory models. In backlogging systems and lost-sales models with zero lead time, we show that it is possible to adapt to demand changes without incurring additional performance loss in stationary environments, even without prior knowledge of the demand distributions or the number of demand shifts. In contrast, for lost-sales systems with positive lead times, we establish weaker guarantees that reflect fundamental limitations imposed by delayed replenishment in combination with censored feedback. Our algorithms leverage the convexity and one-sided feedback structure of inventory costs to enable counterfactual policy evaluation despite demand censoring. We complement the theoretical analysis with simulation results showing that our methods significantly outperform existing benchmarks.

*Chin Pang Ho,Marek Petrik,Wolfram Wiesemann*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimized solution for robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $s$-rectangular ambiguity sets, improving speed significantly over existing solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure robustness in MDPs against poor performance due to ambiguities in the transition kernels while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Developed a unified algorithmic framework designed to solve $s$-rectangular robust MDPs by efficiently handling ambiguity sets, including $1$-norm, $2$-norm, and $φ$-divergence types.

Result: The proposed approach solves robust MDPs several orders of magnitude faster than leading commercial solvers and with scaling close to classical MDPs.

Conclusion: The methods provide an efficient and scalable solution for robust MDPs, making them more applicable to real-world problems with uncertainty.

Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) have attracted significant interest due to their ability to protect MDPs from poor out-of-sample performance in the presence of ambiguity. In contrast to classical MDPs, which account for stochasticity by modeling the dynamics through a stochastic process with a known transition kernel, a robust MDP additionally accounts for ambiguity by optimizing against the most adverse transition kernel from an ambiguity set constructed via historical data. In this paper, we develop a unified solution framework for a broad class of robust MDPs with $s$-rectangular ambiguity sets, where the most adverse transition probabilities are considered independently for each state. Using our algorithms, we show that $s$-rectangular robust MDPs with $1$- and $2$-norm as well as $φ$-divergence ambiguity sets can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art commercial solvers, and often only a logarithmic factor slower than classical MDPs. We demonstrate the favorable scaling properties of our algorithms on a range of synthetically generated as well as standard benchmark instances.

*Arnau Vilella,Jasin Machkour,Michael Muma,Daniel P. Palomar*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper enhances false discovery rate (FDR) control using a learning-augmented T-Rex framework, improving accuracy and statistical power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between error control and statistical power in high-dimensional variable selection, where existing FDR control methods are too conservative.

Method: Replace the analytical false discovery proportion (FDP) estimator in T-Rex with a neural network trained on synthetic datasets for tighter approximate control of FDP.

Result: The enhanced method operates closer to the desired FDR level, yielding higher statistical power. Simulations and synthetic GWAS studies show improved detection of true variables compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: A neural-network-augmented T-Rex framework provides better balance of FDR control and power, enabling more accurate and powerful variable selection.

Abstract: Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in high-dimensional variable selection requires balancing rigorous error control with statistical power. Existing methods with provable guarantees are often overly conservative, creating a persistent gap between the realized false discovery proportion (FDP) and the target FDR level. We introduce a learning-augmented enhancement of the T-Rex Selector framework that narrows this gap. Our approach replaces the analytical FDP estimator with a neural network trained solely on diverse synthetic datasets, enabling a substantially tighter and more accurate approximation of the FDP. This refinement allows the procedure to operate much closer to the desired FDR level, thereby increasing discovery power while maintaining effective approximate control. Through extensive simulations and a challenging synthetic genome-wide association study (GWAS), we demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection of true variables compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for PDMP samplers that uses surrogate models for efficient Bayesian inference in complex problems. Demonstrations with elasticity problems show higher efficiency compared to conventional sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian inference for non-linear inverse problems often involves expensive likelihood computations. A framework is needed to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: A surrogate-assisted thinning scheme dynamically adjusts an offset to enforce an upper bound on true event rates, integrating flexible surrogate models with PDMP samplers such as Zig-Zag and Bouncy particle samplers.

Result: Surrogate-assisted PDMP samplers, especially with GP-based methods, achieve better sampling efficiency and accuracy compared to Random Walk Metropolis and No-U-Turn samplers.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of PDMP samplers integrated with surrogates, making them useful for complex Bayesian inference tasks.

Abstract: We develop a general framework for piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) samplers that enables efficient Bayesian inference in non-linear inverse problems with expensive likelihoods. The key ingredient is a surrogate-assisted thinning scheme in which a surrogate model provides a proposal event rate and a robust correction mechanism enforces an upper bound on the true rate by dynamically adjusting an additive offset whenever violations are detected. This construction is agnostic to the choice of surrogate and PDMP, and we demonstrate it for the Zig-Zag sampler and the Bouncy particle sampler with constant, Laplace, and Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, including gradient-informed and adaptively refined GP variants. As a representative application, we consider Bayesian inference of a spatially varying Young's modulus in a one-dimensional linear elasticity problem. Across dimensions, PDMP samplers equipped with GP-based surrogates achieve substantially higher accuracy and effective sample size per forward model evaluation than Random Walk Metropolis algorithm and the No-U-Turn sampler. The Bouncy particle sampler exhibits the most favorable overall efficiency and scaling, illustrating the potential of the proposed PDMP framework beyond this particular setting.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the security threat of backdoor attacks on neural network controllers in robotics and develops a Trojan network capable of compromising robot behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many robotic systems rely heavily on neural network controllers, but they are vulnerable to backdoor (Trojan) attacks due to untrusted training sources.

Method: The authors design a Trojan network embedded in the robot's controller that activates under specific trigger conditions to compromise behaviors in a differential-drive mobile robot.

Result: The proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that the Trojan network effectively compromises neural controllers during targeted scenarios in simulations.

Conclusion: Robotic systems using neural network controllers are at risk from critical security threats, necessitating robust defensive measures.

Abstract: Neural network controllers are increasingly deployed in robotic systems for tasks such as trajectory tracking and pose stabilization. However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.

Result: The improved model shows faster convergence, up to $+40$ higher rewards than standard DQN, and achieves efficiency in grid navigation environments.

Conclusion: Enhancements to NoisyNet structure, exploration control, and stability lead to better efficiency and reliability in deep Q-learning for UAVs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network (Noisy DQN) to enhance the exploration and stability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when applying deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments. This method enhances the exploration ability by combining the residual NoisyLinear layer with an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism, while improving training stability through smooth loss and soft target network updates. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves faster convergence and up to $+40$ higher rewards compared to standard DQN and quickly reach to the minimum number of steps required for the task 28 in the 15 * 15 grid navigation environment set up.

Motivation: Inventory management, a critical aspect of supply chain management, faces challenges with traditional methods. LLM-based MASs offer promise but have uncertainties regarding effectiveness.

Method: The study tests LLM-based MASs with a fixed-ordering strategy prompt and analyzes their adaptability. It introduces AIM-RM, an agent leveraging historical experiences through similarity matching.

Result: Empirical results reveal LLM-based MASs can determine optimal ordering in limited scenarios. AIM-RM shows superior performance across various supply chain scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-based MASs show potential in inventory management, with AIM-RM improving robustness and adaptability, addressing key supply chain challenges.

Abstract: This study investigates large language model (LLM) -based multi-agent systems (MASs) as a promising approach to inventory management, which is a key component of supply chain management. Although these systems have gained considerable attention for their potential to address the challenges associated with typical inventory management methods, key uncertainties regarding their effectiveness persist. Specifically, it is unclear whether LLM-based MASs can consistently derive optimal ordering policies and adapt to diverse supply chain scenarios. To address these questions, we examine an LLM-based MAS with a fixed-ordering strategy prompt that encodes the stepwise processes of the problem setting and a safe-stock strategy commonly used in inventory management. Our empirical results demonstrate that, even without detailed prompt adjustments, an LLM-based MAS can determine optimal ordering decisions in a restricted scenario. To enhance adaptability, we propose a novel agent called AIM-RM, which leverages similar historical experiences through similarity matching. Our results show that AIM-RM outperforms benchmark methods across various supply chain scenarios, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

*Joseph Fioresi,Parth Parag Kulkarni,Ashmal Vayani,Song Wang,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Learning to Share (LTS), a shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic systems, which reduces redundant computation while maintaining or enhancing task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parallel agentic systems have computational inefficiencies due to redundant work when solving similar sub-problems, leading to a need for a mechanism to improve efficiency.

Method: LTS uses a global memory bank, accessible across agent teams, managed by a lightweight controller trained with reinforcement learning to selectively add or omit information, avoiding unnecessary memory growth.

Result: The proposed method, LTS, demonstrated substantial runtime reduction and matched or outperformed baselines in terms of task performance on benchmarks AssistantBench and GAIA.

Conclusion: LTS highlights that optimizing memory reuse via a trained controller significantly enhances computational efficiency in parallel agentic systems without compromising solution quality.

Abstract: Agentic systems solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents that iteratively reason, invoke tools, and exchange intermediate results. To improve robustness and solution quality, recent approaches deploy multiple agent teams running in parallel to explore diverse reasoning trajectories. However, parallel execution comes at a significant computational cost: when different teams independently reason about similar sub-problems or execute analogous steps, they repeatedly perform substantial overlapping computation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose Learning to Share (LTS), a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic frameworks that enables selective cross-team information reuse while controlling context growth. LTS introduces a global memory bank accessible to all teams and a lightweight controller that decides whether intermediate agent steps should be added to memory or not. The controller is trained using stepwise reinforcement learning with usage-aware credit assignment, allowing it to identify information that is globally useful across parallel executions. Experiments on the AssistantBench and GAIA benchmarks show that LTS significantly reduces overall runtime while matching or improving task performance compared to memory-free parallel baselines, demonstrating that learned memory admission is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysicsAgentABM, a hybrid modeling approach combining symbolic agents and neural transition models to address challenges in scalable and calibrated simulation in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to overcome limitations of current multi-agent systems: high expense and poor calibration in LLM-based systems, and lack of adaptability and expressiveness in classical ABMs.

Method: The method involves a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach: specialized symbolic agents for mechanistic priors, multimodal neural models for dynamics, and uncertainty-aware fusion for calibrated transitions, enhanced by an LLM-based clustering strategy named ANCHOR.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in event-time accuracy and calibration across domains like public health, finance, and social sciences, with reduced computational costs by cutting LLM calls 6-8 times.

Conclusion: PhysicsAgentABM offers a scalable and robust paradigm for agent-based modeling, balancing interpretability, cost-effectiveness, and accuracy by integrating population-level inference and neuro-symbolic methods.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.

*Ning Wang,Kuanyan Zhu,Daniel Yuehwoon Yee,Yitang Gao,Shiying Huang,Zirun Xu,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces AutoPrunedRetriever, a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that significantly improves efficiency and reasoning accuracy by incrementally building on earlier reasoning graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems treat every query as independent, requiring repetitive re-retrieval and reasoning, which results in high token usage, latency, and cost. There is a need for a more efficient, scalable system for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: The authors propose a compact graph-based approach called AutoPrunedRetriever, where entities, relations, and questions are represented as edge sequences. The system applies consolidation policies and pruning to maintain efficiency. Two front ends are implemented: one using the REBEL triplet parser and the other using an LLM extractor.

Result: AutoPrunedRetriever achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy on several benchmarks, improving performance by 9-11 points compared to the previous best system while drastically reducing token usage. It performs exceptionally well on complex reasoning and harder benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoPrunedRetriever is both highly accurate and efficient, suitable for evolving corpora, long-running tasks, and multi-agent contexts. It provides a significant advancement in RAG systems by reducing costs and improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is now standard for knowledge-intensive LLM tasks, but most systems still treat every query as fresh, repeatedly re-retrieving long passages and re-reasoning from scratch, inflating tokens, latency, and cost. We present AutoPrunedRetriever, a graph-style RAG system that persists the minimal reasoning subgraph built for earlier questions and incrementally extends it for later ones. AutoPrunedRetriever stores entities and relations in a compact, ID-indexed codebook and represents questions, facts, and answers as edge sequences, enabling retrieval and prompting over symbolic structure instead of raw text. To keep the graph compact, we apply a two-layer consolidation policy (fast ANN/KNN alias detection plus selective $k$-means once a memory threshold is reached) and prune low-value structure, while prompts retain only overlap representatives and genuinely new evidence. We instantiate two front ends: AutoPrunedRetriever-REBEL, which uses REBEL as a triplet parser, and AutoPrunedRetriever-llm, which swaps in an LLM extractor. On GraphRAG-Benchmark (Medical and Novel), both variants achieve state-of-the-art complex reasoning accuracy, improving over HippoRAG2 by roughly 9--11 points, and remain competitive on contextual summarize and generation. On our harder STEM and TV benchmarks, AutoPrunedRetriever again ranks first, while using up to two orders of magnitude fewer tokens than graph-heavy baselines, making it a practical substrate for long-running sessions, evolving corpora, and multi-agent pipelines.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical insights into how configuration parameters can manage the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, enabling scalable RAG systems for entity matching and data integration.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLM reasoning in knowledge-intensive tasks, but existing RAG pipelines incur substantial retrieval and generation overhead when applied to large-scale entity matching. To address this limitation, we introduce CE-RAG4EM, a cost-efficient RAG architecture that reduces computation through blocking-based batch retrieval and generation. We also present a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating RAG systems for entity matching, focusing on blocking-aware optimizations and retrieval granularity. Extensive experiments suggest that CE-RAG4EM can achieve comparable or improved matching quality while substantially reducing end-to-end runtime relative to strong baselines. Our analysis further reveals that key configuration parameters introduce an inherent trade-off between performance and overhead, offering practical guidance for designing efficient and scalable RAG systems for entity matching and data integration.

*Rulla Al-Haideri,Bilal Farooq*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes pedestrian interactions with autonomous vehicles using behavioral data and machine learning models to identify key influence factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety in mixed traffic environments by understanding pedestrian movement adjustments during encounters with autonomous vehicles.

Method: Used the NuScenes dataset to study pedestrian behaviors with a hybrid method combining the Residual Logit model and machine learning to analyze temporal, spatial, kinematic, and perceptual factors.

Result: Identified significant directional asymmetries in risk perception and other movement adjustment factors like relative speed, visual looming, remaining distance, and collision risk proximity.

Conclusion: Pedestrian behavior reflects tendencies influenced by risk perception and efficiency, but predictive performance needs improvement for practical usage.

Abstract: Understanding how pedestrians adjust their movement when interacting with autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for improving safety in mixed traffic. This study examines micro-level pedestrian behaviour during midblock encounters in the NuScenes dataset using a hybrid discrete choice-machine learning framework based on the Residual Logit (ResLogit) model. The model incorporates temporal, spatial, kinematic, and perceptual indicators. These include relative speed, visual looming, remaining distance, and directional collision risk proximity (CRP) measures. Results suggest that some of these variables may meaningfully influence movement adjustments, although predictive performance remains moderate. Marginal effects and elasticities indicate strong directional asymmetries in risk perception, with frontal and rear CRP showing opposite influences. The remaining distance exhibits a possible mid-crossing threshold. Relative speed cues appear to have a comparatively less effect. These patterns may reflect multiple behavioural tendencies driven by both risk perception and movement efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI is becoming a dominant workload category, requiring scalable and resource-efficient infrastructure for inference tasks, which Kubernetes can potentially provide.

Method: The authors implemented a two-part use case utilizing Kubernetes tools: batch inference with Kueue and DAS, and online inference using llm-d, GAIE, and Gateway API Inference Extension for routing.

Result: Kueue improved makespan by 15%, DAS decreased job completion time by 36%, and GAIE optimized Time to First Token by 82%, demonstrating enhanced performance for GenAI workloads.

Conclusion: Kubernetes-native solutions form a high-performance, cohesive platform to support demanding AI workflows, showing promising scalability and efficiency in inference tasks.

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI), particularly inference, rapidly emerges as a dominant workload category, the Kubernetes ecosystem is proactively evolving to natively support its unique demands. This industry paper demonstrates how emerging Kubernetes-native projects can be combined to deliver the benefits of container orchestration, such as scalability and resource efficiency, to complex AI workflows. We implement and evaluate an illustrative, multi-stage use case consisting of automatic speech recognition and summarization. First, we address batch inference by using Kueue to manage jobs that transcribe audio files with Whisper models and Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) to increase parallel job execution. Second, we address a discrete online inference scenario by feeding the transcripts to a Large Language Model for summarization hosted using llm-d, a novel solution utilizing the recent developments around the Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE) for optimized routing of inference requests. Our findings illustrate that these complementary components (Kueue, DAS, and GAIE) form a cohesive, high-performance platform, proving Kubernetes' capability to serve as a unified foundation for demanding GenAI workloads: Kueue reduced total makespan by up to 15%; DAS shortened mean job completion time by 36%; and GAIE improved Time to First Token by 82\%.

Motivation: Current large language models excel in protein representation but struggle with understanding and designing antibodies directly using natural language.

Method: The authors developed AFD-Instruction, a large-scale instruction dataset comprising two parts: understanding functional attributes of antibodies from sequences and generating antibody sequences constrained by functional requirements.

Result: AFD-Instruction significantly improves the ability of general-purpose large language models to perform diverse antibody-related tasks through instruction-tuning experiments.

Conclusion: AFD-Instruction provides a crucial link between antibody sequences and functional language descriptions, laying a foundation for better antibody modeling and faster therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced protein representation learning. However, their capacity to interpret and design antibodies through natural language remains limited. To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes XEmoGPT, a framework for explainable multimodal emotion recognition, addressing challenges in cue-level emotional reasoning and perception by introducing specialized modules and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal emotion recognition systems struggle with fine-grained emotional cues due to limitations in pretrained modality encoders and dataset quality, coupled with inadequate evaluation metrics.

Method: XEmoGPT uses Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB) for enhanced cue perception, employs the EmoCue dataset for multimodal reasoning, and introduces EmoCue-360 and EmoCue-Eval for better evaluation.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that XEmoGPT excels in perceiving and reasoning emotional cues, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: XEmoGPT effectively addresses limitations in multimodal emotion recognition with its novel framework, enabling advancements in emotional reasoning and perception.

Abstract: Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition plays a crucial role in applications such as human-computer interaction and social media analytics. However, current approaches struggle with cue-level perception and reasoning due to two main challenges: 1) general-purpose modality encoders are pretrained to capture global structures and general semantics rather than fine-grained emotional cues, resulting in limited sensitivity to emotional signals; and 2) available datasets usually involve a trade-off between annotation quality and scale, which leads to insufficient supervision for emotional cues and ultimately limits cue-level reasoning. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are inadequate for assessing cue-level reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose eXplainable Emotion GPT (XEmoGPT), a novel EMER framework capable of both perceiving and reasoning over emotional cues. It incorporates two specialized modules: the Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and the Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB), which enhance the video and audio encoders through carefully designed tasks for fine-grained emotional cue perception. To further support cue-level reasoning, we construct a large-scale dataset, EmoCue, designed to teach XEmoGPT how to reason over multimodal emotional cues. In addition, we introduce EmoCue-360, an automated metric that extracts and matches emotional cues using semantic similarity, and release EmoCue-Eval, a benchmark of 400 expert-annotated samples covering diverse emotional scenarios. Experimental results show that XEmoGPT achieves strong performance in both emotional cue perception and reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a universal quantum computing model that incorporates memory and temporal sequencing, advancing towards a quantum von Neumann architecture.

Method: QSCs leverage symmetry-protected topological junctions, Choi states via channel-state duality, and ebits for feedback loops; a departure from traditional qubit-based approaches.

Result: Defined QSC as a new paradigm that integrates memory and temporal features in quantum circuits, complementing current combinational quantum models.

Conclusion: QSCs could significantly enhance large-scale quantum information processors, paving the way for modular and hybrid designs aligned with a quantum von Neumann architecture.

Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes quantum sequential circuits (QSCs) as a hardware-oriented paradigm for quantum computing, built upon a novel foundational element termed the quantum transistor. Unlike conventional qubit-based architectures, QSCs employ symmetry-protected topological junctions where quantum gates are encoded as Choi states via channel-state duality and activated through bulk measurements, utilizing ebits to realize the functional analog of feedback loops in classical sequential circuits. This framework establishes a universal model for quantum computation that inherently incorporates memory and temporal sequencing, complementing existing combinational quantum circuit model. Our work advances the conceptual bridge towards a quantum von Neumann architecture, underscoring the potential of hybrid and modular design principles for the development of large-scale, integrated quantum information processors.

TL;DR: The paper investigates Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) for distributed quantum computing and compares global and local optimization approaches in mitigating communication-induced noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of errors in distributed quantum computing environments, particularly those introduced by noisy communication networks.

Method: The study compares Global ZNE (applied before partitioning) and Local ZNE (applied to sub-circuits independently) across varying numbers of quantum processing units. It integrates noisy teleportation-based communication primitives to simulate distributed implementation.

Result: Global ZNE proves to be superior in scalability, achieving up to 48% error reduction across six QPUs. Unexpected behavior is observed where increasing QPUs enhances mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication noise.

Conclusion: The findings suggest critical trade-offs and open questions on circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network-induced noise in distributed quantum error mitigation.

Abstract: Errors are the primary bottleneck preventing practical quantum computing. This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise.

### [567] [The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801)
*Peter Robinson,Ming Ming Tan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses the distributed wake-up problem with advice in quantum routing models, presenting new bounds on message complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve efficiency in waking up all sleeping nodes in a network by using advice and quantum models, overcoming limitations of classical routing.

Method: The authors propose a quantum advising scheme with $\alpha$ bits of advice per node and analyze its message complexity, offering upper bounds in efficient wake-up algorithms. They also develop lower bounds using single-bit descriptor problem results.

Result: The advising scheme achieves a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max{\lfloor (\alpha-1)/2 \rfloor},0}}}\cdot\log n )$. A lower bound of $Ω(n^{3/2})$ is established for quantum algorithms in the absence of advice.

Conclusion: Quantum models can break classical message complexity barriers for distributed wake-up problems given sufficient advice. Lower bounds highlight efficiency limits, providing insights for other graph problems.

Abstract: We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $α$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (α-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $Ω( \frac{n^2}{2^α} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $Ω( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuantumGS, integrating Variational Quantum Circuits into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline for improved rendering of complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work seeks to address the limitations of standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in capturing high-frequency view-dependent effects like sharp reflections and transparency, aiming for better expressivity and generalization.

Method: The authors proposed QuantumGS, which integrates Variational Quantum Circuits into the 3DGS pipeline. They developed an encoding strategy mapping viewing directions onto the Bloch sphere and replaced classical networks with quantum circuits enhanced by hypernetworks or conditioning mechanisms.

Result: QuantumGS achieves higher expressivity and better generalization compared to classical methods, with improved representation of high-frequency effects.

Conclusion: The integration of quantum circuits into neural rendering demonstrates a promising path for overcoming limitations in expressivity, opening possibilities for further advancements in complex scene rendering.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

### [569] [Instance-optimal high-precision shadow tomography with few-copy measurements: A metrological approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04952)
*Senrui Chen,Weiyuan Gong,Sisi Zhou*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the sample complexity for shadow tomography with high-precision measurements. It provides an instance-optimal sample complexity characterization as $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$, which is significant progress over prior special-case results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance understanding and efficiency in quantum state tomography, specifically in the high-precision regime, while considering realistic measurement constraints. The study aims to unify quantum learning and metrology.

Method: The paper introduces an optimal sample complexity bound based on $Γ_p$, representing quantum Fisher information. It proposes a two-step estimation algorithm and analyzes oblivious and adaptive measurement scenarios.

Result: The study establishes that $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$ is both necessary and sufficient for accurate shadow tomography. Additionally, allowing $c$-copy measurements only marginally improves sample efficiency by $Ω(1/c)$.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between quantum metrology and learning, providing exact sample complexity bounds and a unified perspective for quantum tomography.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $ρ$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_iρ)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $ε$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $ρ$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $ε$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.
  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$, where $Γ_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m α_i O_i$ with $\|α\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $Θ(Γ^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/ε^2)$. We then show $\tildeΘ(Γ_p/ε^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $Γ^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = Γ_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $Ω(1/c)$.
  Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.

### [570] [Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05058)
*Aria Christensen,Andrew Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces improved algorithms for learning fermionic linear optics (FLO) with better query efficiency, minimal ancillary modes, and experimentally friendly operations, reducing the previous computational complexities significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop efficient learning protocols for FLO that adhere to physical constraints (superselection rules), reduce ancillary mode requirements, and improve query efficiency.

Method: Authors propose learning algorithms for FLO that minimize resource usage: obeying superselection rules, using a maximum of one ancillary mode, and reducing required queries to $	ilde{O}(n^4/\varepsilon)$ for general FLOs and $	ilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ for passive FLOs.

Result: The paper achieves improved query complexity for learning FLO algorithms: $	ilde{O}(n^4/\varepsilon)$ for active FLOs and $	ilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ for passive FLOs. Additionally, improved copy complexity for state tomography is demonstrated.

Conclusion: This research establishes the first FLO learning protocol achieving Heisenberg scaling in precision, meeting experimental feasibility, and enhancing query efficiency. It also introduces advancements in state tomography for specific quantum states.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n η^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $η$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental classical computing operation whose efficiency becomes a major challenge at scale, especially for machine learning applications. Quantum computing, with its inherent parallelism and exponential storage capacity, offers a potential solution to these limitations. This work presents a quantum kernel-based matrix multiplication algorithm (QKMM) that achieves an asymptotically optimal computational complexity of $ O(N^2 \log_2 N) $, outperforming the classical optimal complexity of $ O(N^{2.371552}) $, where $N$ denotes the matrix dimension. Through noiseless and noisy quantum simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits superior theoretical efficiency but also shows practical advantages in runtime performance and stability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces scBIG, a framework that predicts transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations by explicitly modeling gene program coordination, showcasing improvements over existing methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of existing methods that do not model coordinated, program-level transcriptional changes and rely on static biological priors.

Method: Propose scBIG, which uses Gene-Relation Clustering, a Gene-Cluster-Aware Encoder, structure-aware alignment objectives, and conditional flow matching for perturbation predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show scBIG outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.7%, especially for unseen and combinatorial perturbations.

Conclusion: scBIG effectively models gene program coordination and offers enhanced and generalizable predictions for transcriptional responses in functional genomics.

Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations is a central problem in functional genomics. In practice, perturbation responses are rarely gene-independent but instead manifest as coordinated, program-level transcriptional changes among functionally related genes. However, most existing methods do not explicitly model such coordination, due to gene-wise modeling paradigms and reliance on static biological priors that cannot capture dynamic program reorganization. To address these limitations, we propose scBIG, a module-inductive perturbation prediction framework that explicitly models coordinated gene programs. scBIG induces coherent gene programs from data via Gene-Relation Clustering, captures inter-program interactions through a Gene-Cluster-Aware Encoder, and preserves modular coordination using structure-aware alignment objectives. These structured representations are then modeled using conditional flow matching to enable flexible and generalizable perturbation prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple single-cell perturbation benchmarks show that scBIG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly on unseen and combinatorial perturbation settings, achieving an average improvement of 6.7% over the strongest baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, called scale-aware interpretability, that uses tools from renormalisation in physics to interpret neural networks, focusing on hierarchical and multi-scale structures in data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to interpret neural networks often ignore the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of data and fail to handle fine-grained irrelevant information effectively.

Method: The authors introduce a proposed unifying agenda based on the renormalisation framework in physics, aiming to synthesize matured research from adjacent fields to create theory-informed and practical interpretability tools.

Result: The study combines advancements in interpretability techniques and proposes to develop novel tools emphasizing robustness and faithfulness to neural network hierarchies.

Conclusion: Renormalisation-based methods can provide a robust foundation for scale-aware interpretability, opening pathways for enhanced understanding and safety in AI systems.

Abstract: Neural networks organize information according to the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of natural data. Methods to interpret model internals should be similarly scale-aware, explicitly tracking how features compose across resolutions and guaranteeing bounds on the influence of fine-grained structure that is discarded as irrelevant noise. We posit that the renormalisation framework from physics can meet this need by offering technical tools that can overcome limitations of current methods. Moreover, relevant work from adjacent fields has now matured to a point where scattered research threads can be synthesized into practical, theory-informed tools. To combine these threads in an AI safety context, we propose a unifying research agenda -- \emph{scale-aware interpretability} -- to develop formal machinery and interpretability tools that have robustness and faithfulness properties supported by statistical physics.

Conclusion: Effective citation verification processes, including mandatory automated tools, are needed to prevent normalizing false references in scientific work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in academic writing workflows, yet they frequently hallucinate by generating citations to sources that do not exist. This study analyzes 100 AI-generated hallucinated citations that appeared in papers accepted by the 2025 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), one of the world's most prestigious AI conferences. Despite review by 3-5 expert researchers per paper, these fabricated citations evaded detection, appearing in 53 published papers (approx. 1% of all accepted papers). We develop a five-category taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by their failure mode: Total Fabrication (66%), Partial Attribute Corruption (27%), Identifier Hijacking (4%), Placeholder Hallucination (2%), and Semantic Hallucination (1%). Our analysis reveals a critical finding: every hallucination (100%) exhibited compound failure modes. The distribution of secondary characteristics was dominated by Semantic Hallucination (63%) and Identifier Hijacking (29%), which often appeared alongside Total Fabrication to create a veneer of plausibility and false verifiability. These compound structures exploit multiple verification heuristics simultaneously, explaining why peer review fails to detect them. The distribution exhibits a bimodal pattern: 92% of contaminated papers contain 1-2 hallucinations (minimal AI use) while 8% contain 4-13 hallucinations (heavy reliance). These findings demonstrate that current peer review processes do not include effective citation verification and that the problem extends beyond NeurIPS to other major conferences, government reports, and professional consulting. We propose mandatory automated citation verification at submission as an implementable solution to prevent fabricated citations from becoming normalized in scientific literature.

Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive dataset for machine learning applications in geophysics by offering a geographically diverse and standardized seismic dataset.

Method: Data was collected, filtered, and standardized from NAMSS, covering 2588 sections from 122 survey areas geographically balanced and split into non-overlapping macro-regions for robust experimentation.

Result: Quantitative and embedding-space analyses showed the dataset’s variability and coherence. Comparisons revealed broader seismic appearance coverage compared to other interpretation datasets, proving strong usability for machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: Unicamp-NAMSS provides a robust resource for various machine learning tasks in geophysics, including pretraining, transfer learning, benchmarking, and domain adaptation.

Abstract: We introduce the Unicamp-NAMSS dataset, a large, diverse, and geographically distributed collection of migrated 2D seismic sections designed to support modern machine learning research in geophysics. We constructed the dataset from the National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS), which contains decades of publicly available marine seismic data acquired across multiple regions, acquisition conditions, and geological settings. After a comprehensive collection and filtering process, we obtained 2588 cleaned and standardized seismic sections from 122 survey areas, covering a wide range of vertical and horizontal sampling characteristics. To ensure reliable experimentation, we balanced the dataset so that no survey dominates the distribution, and partitioned it into non-overlapping macro-regions for training, validation, and testing. This region-disjoint split allows robust evaluation of generalization to unseen geological and acquisition conditions.
  We validated the dataset through quantitative and embedding-space analyses using both convolutional and transformer-based models. These analyses showed that Unicamp-NAMSS exhibits substantial variability within and across regions, while maintaining coherent structure across acquisition macro-region and survey types. Comparisons with widely used interpretation datasets (Parihaka and F3 Block) further demonstrated that Unicamp-NAMSS covers a broader portion of the seismic appearance space, making it a strong candidate for machine learning model pretraining. The dataset, therefore, provides a valuable resource for machine learning tasks, including self-supervised representation learning, transfer learning, benchmarking supervised tasks such as super-resolution or attribute prediction, and studying domain adaptation in seismic interpretation.
