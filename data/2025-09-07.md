### [1] [PG-Agent: An Agent Powered by Page Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03536)
*Weizhi Chen,Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Sheng Zhou,Xiaoxuan Tang,Jiajun Bu,Yong Li,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for transforming sequential GUI usage into page graphs, utilizing them to enhance the generalization capability of GUI agents through a specialized multi-agent framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in enabling GUI agents to better perceive GUI environments and generalize to new scenarios, addressing the limitation of using sequential episodes that miss complex inter-page transitions.

Method: The authors propose transforming sequential episodes into page graphs using an automated pipeline and utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for effective information retrieval. They also introduce a multi-agent framework (PG-Agent) with a task decomposition strategy.

Result: Experiments on various benchmarks validate PG-Agent's effectiveness in improving GUI agents' generalizability even with limited data for constructing page graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables GUI agents to better understand and generalize complex GUI environments, showcasing a practical and effective solution.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

### [2] [Multilinear and Linear Programs for Partially Identifiable Queries in Quasi-Markovian Structural Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03548)
*João P. Arroyo,João G. Rodrigues,Daniel Lawand,Denis D. Mauá,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Alex Gray,Eduardo R. Laurentino,Fabio G. Cozman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new algorithm for computing bounds on partially identifiable causal queries within quasi-Markovian causal models using linear integer programming and column generation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of computing tight bounds on probabilities in causal models when endogenous variables are observed but exogenous variables are incompletely specified, a scenario where current methods are either inefficient or overly complex.

Method: They propose an algorithm that uses column generation, which iteratively solves auxiliary linear integer programs to simplify and improve computational efficiency in constructing multilinear or linear programming frameworks for causal models.

Result: Their approach reduces the complexity of causal query computation with a polynomial representation for exogenous variables and demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods in experimental setups.

Conclusion: The study presents an improved and computationally efficient method for deriving tight probability bounds in quasi-Markovian causal models, advancing the understanding and application of causal inference.

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [3] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-AC, a novel conflict resolution framework using diffusion probabilistic models for autonomous air traffic management, demonstrating robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and outperforming traditional DRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising global air traffic necessitates efficient and safe Conflict Detection and Resolution, where existing deep reinforcement learning methods struggle with decision-making flexibility under complex constraints.

Method: The authors propose Diffusion-AC, which models policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, paired with a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum for gradual training from sparse to dense traffic scenarios.

Result: Simulation experiments show Diffusion-AC achieving a high success rate of 94.1% in high-density traffic and reducing Near Mid-Air Collisions by 59% compared to other methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC's multimodal decision-making significantly improves conflict resolution flexibility and safety in high-density air traffic scenarios, making it a promising step forward in automated air traffic management.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

### [4] [Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581)
*Davide Paglieri,Bartłomiej Cupiał,Jonathan Cook,Ulyana Piterbarg,Jens Tuyls,Edward Grefenstette,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Jack Parker-Holder,Tim Rocktäschel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic planning method for training large language model (LLM) agents to allocate computational resources efficiently during decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the limitations of existing reinforcement learning techniques for reasoning in LLMs, noting that always or never planning can hinder performance or efficiency in long-horizon tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on synthetic data to enable dynamic planning and reinforcement learning to refine this capability in long-horizon environments.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed dynamic planning approach achieves higher sample efficiency, completes more complex objectives, and can leverage human-written plans effectively.

Conclusion: This study is the first to formalize dynamic planning for LLM agents, offering a foundation for more adaptive and efficient agentic systems in sequential decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

### [5] [Explainable Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) with KG-SMILE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03626)
*Zahra Zehtabi Sabeti Moghaddam,Zeinab Dehghani,Maneeha Rani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Rameez Raja Kureshi,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KG-SMILE, a method for improving the transparency and interpretability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, making them more reliable, especially in sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Generative AI, such as hallucinations and unverifiable claims, and to make RAG systems less opaque and more reliable in critical domains like healthcare.

Method: A perturbation-based, method-agnostic framework named KG-SMILE is used to identify influential graph entities and relations in RAG systems by applying controlled perturbations, computing similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates.

Result: Evaluation with metrics like fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy indicates that KG-SMILE provides human-aligned explanations and enhances transparency and trust in machine learning outputs.

Conclusion: KG-SMILE effectively balances model effectiveness with interpretability, fostering enhanced trust and transparency in machine learning technologies, particularly in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

### [6] [CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636)
*Jacqueline Maasch,John Kalantari,Kia Khezeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalARC, a testbed for assessing AI reasoning in scenarios with limited data and distribution shifts, utilizing causal world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of equipping AI systems with reasoning abilities in low-data and out-of-distribution settings, crucial for robust problem-solving.

Method: CausalARC leverages structural causal models and principled data augmentations, providing observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback for few-shot, in-context learning.

Result: CausalARC is demonstrated through four evaluation scenarios for language models: abstract reasoning, counterfactual reasoning, program synthesis, and causal discovery.

Conclusion: The study establishes CausalARC as a valuable framework for exploring AI reasoning mechanisms under constrained data and distributional shifts.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

### [7] [Towards a Neurosymbolic Reasoning System Grounded in Schematic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03644)
*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Embodied-LM, a neurosymbolic approach that enhances logical reasoning in LLMs by incorporating cognitive structures based on image schemas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of LLMs in performing robust logical reasoning and to provide a system that mimics human-like comprehension using cognitive structures.

Method: Embodied-LM incorporates schematic image-based representations grounded in sensorimotor experiences and spatial reasoning implemented through Answer Set Programming (ASP).

Result: The evaluation shows that Embodied-LM improves logical reasoning and interpretability in LLMs by leveraging embodied cognitive structures.

Conclusion: Embodied-LM demonstrates a viable approach for integrating human cognitive structures into LLMs and serves as a basis for future extensions with more complex representations.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

### [8] [Emergent Hierarchical Reasoning in LLMs through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03646)
*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs) and introduces a new hierarchy-aware algorithm to improve training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RL has shown success in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, the mechanisms behind this success are not well understood. The researchers aim to uncover these mechanisms and address inefficiencies in existing algorithms.

Method: The authors analyze emergent reasoning dynamics in RL-enhanced LLMs, characterize an emergent reasoning hierarchy, and develop the Hierarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA) algorithm to focus optimization on high-impact strategic tokens.

Result: HICRA outperforms strong RL baselines by targeting the strategic reasoning bottleneck, and semantic entropy is validated as a more effective metric for strategic exploration than token-level entropy.

Conclusion: Strategically focusing RL optimization on high-impact tokens enables more advanced reasoning in LLMs, paving the way for more efficient and effective algorithms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

### [9] [The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730)
*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting inconsistencies between self-reported traits and behavioral expressions, while emphasizing the need for deeper evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore whether LLMs exhibit personality-like traits and observe how these traits emerge, predict behavior, and respond to interventions like persona injection.

Method: Researchers used a systematic approach to examine LLM traits during training, evaluated self-reported traits' behavioral validity, and tested interventions like persona injection.

Result: Instructional alignment stabilized trait expression and mirrored human data but showed that self-reported traits were unreliable predictors of behavior. Persona injection influenced self-reports but had little effect on behavior.

Conclusion: The study challenges the assumption that LLMs' personality traits are consistent between expression and behavior, stressing the importance of robust evaluations in alignment and interpretability research.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

### [10] [An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649)
*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of SHAP for long time series by exploring segmentation techniques and proposes a normalization method to improve explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to make complex TSC models interpretable and computationally feasible using SHAP methodology for time series data.

Method: Investigated eight segmentation methods and introduced a novel segment-length weighting normalization to evaluate XAI attribution quality.

Result: Equal-length segmentation outperformed other methods, and the proposed normalization technique consistently enhanced attribution accuracy.

Conclusion: Segmentation length plays a larger role than segmentation method, and normalization significantly improves results for both MTS and UTS models.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

### [11] [PersonaTeaming: Exploring How Introducing Personas Can Improve Automated AI Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03728)
*Wesley Hanwen Deng,Sunnie S. Y. Kim,Akshita Jha,Ken Holstein,Motahhare Eslami,Lauren Wilcox,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaTeaming, a novel automated red-teaming method that incorporates personas in adversarial prompt generation to uncover a broader range of AI risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gaps in current automated red-teaming methods, which do not take into account the identities and backgrounds influencing red-teaming strategies, thus limiting the types of risks uncovered.

Method: The authors propose PersonaTeaming by mutating prompts with "red-teaming expert" or "regular AI user" personas, developing a dynamic persona-generating algorithm and introducing metrics for measuring mutation distance to evaluate diversity and effectiveness.

Result: PersonaTeaming achieved up to 144.1% improvement in attack success rates while maintaining prompt diversity, outperforming a state-of-the-art method called RainbowPlus.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of incorporating identity-driven personas in automated red-teaming to complement human methods, while pointing out areas for future research, such as understanding various persona impacts and mutation strategies.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

*Connor Walker,Koorosh Aslansefat,Mohammad Naveed Akram,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAGuard, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, to improve both technical accuracy and safety coverage in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLMs struggle with specialized or unexpected scenarios in OSW maintenance, necessitating a framework that ensures both technical accuracy and safety.

Method: The paper presents RAGuard, a RAG framework that integrates safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals by issuing queries across separate retrieval indices for technical and safety information. Additionally, the SafetyClamp extension fetches a larger candidate pool to ensure safety slot guarantees.

Result: RAGuard achieved a notable improvement in Safety Recall@K (from 0% in standard RAG to over 50%) while maintaining Technical Recall above 60%.

Conclusion: RAGuard and its SafetyClamp extension show significant promise for improving safety assurance in LLM-based decision support for critical OSW maintenance tasks.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

### [13] [Are LLM Agents Behaviorally Coherent? Latent Profiles for Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736)
*James Mooney,Josef Woldense,Zheng Robert Jia,Shirley Anugrah Hayati,My Ha Nguyen,Vipul Raheja,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can maintain behavioral consistency across different experimental settings, finding significant inconsistencies that challenge their use as substitutes for human participants in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers are exploring whether LLMs can replace human participants in social science studies, focusing on behavioral consistency, rather than just alignment with human data.

Method: The study investigates LLMs' internal state and dialogue behavior by testing if their revealed internal state aligns with conversation behavior in varied experimental conditions.

Result: Significant internal inconsistencies were found across LLM model families and sizes, indicating they struggle to consistently reflect their internal state in behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs may align superficially with human data but fail to consistently represent internal states, limiting their ability to replace real participants in human-subject research.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF) and SoftRankPO to improve multi-agent reasoning in large language models, yielding 4-5% higher accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks for LLMs rely on fixed collaboration protocols and lack meta-cognitive capabilities, limiting the adaptability and effectiveness of these systems.

Method: The authors propose MPDF, where agents adopt decentralized policies for high-level meta-cognitive actions (Persist, Refine, Concede), and develop SoftRankPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that stabilizes training by ranking rewards using smooth quantiles.

Result: MPDF with SoftRankPO outperformed six state-of-the-art algorithms by 4-5% in accuracy across five reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work underscores the value of adaptive meta-cognitive strategies in multi-agent systems for achieving more effective collaboration and reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper assesses the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in crafting homelessness alleviation policies across four global geographies and evaluates their alignment with domain experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of homelessness affecting over 150 million people globally, the paper explores if LLMs can provide valuable alternative policy insights through their capabilities.

Method: The study designs a benchmark based on decision scenarios rooted in the Capability Approach framework, connects it to an agent-based model, and evaluates policy impacts via simulated scenarios.

Result: It finds promising potential for LLMs in social policymaking, especially if combined with guardrails and collaboration with domain experts.

Conclusion: LLMs, with proper calibration and safeguards, could assist humans by generating scalable alternative policies in complex social domains like homelessness alleviation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

### [17] [An Agentic Model Context Protocol Framework for Medical Concept Standardization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03828)
*Jaerong Ahn,Andrew Wen,Nan Wang,Heling Jia,Zhiyi Yue,Sunyang Fu,Hongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-training mapping system integrated with large language models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of converting medical terms to standardized concepts within the OMOP common data model (CDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of mapping medical terms to standardized concepts in OMOP CDM is time-consuming, prone to errors, and resource-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) can help streamline this process but tend to hallucinate, making them unreliable without safeguards.

Method: The authors introduced a mapping system based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which prevents hallucinations by allowing LLMs to interact with external tools and resources. This framework facilitates explainable mappings and integrates with vocabulary lookup and structured reasoning.

Result: The proposed system significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of mapping processes while reducing expert validation efforts. It offers real-time capabilities that are applicable in both exploratory and production settings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the developed MCP-based system provides a secure, efficient, and accurate solution to medical term standardization for OMOP CDM, improving usability without the need for extensive training or expert intervention.

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-driven framework to analyze tourist perceptions using social media data, applied in analyzing Shanghai's historic urban quarters' aesthetics and sentiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand tourists’ perceptions of historic urban quarters for sustainable and human-centered urban planning.

Method: An AI-powered framework analyzes multimodal social media data, including a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model for photos, clustering for dominant colors, and hybrid sentiment analysis combining rule-based methods with a multi-task BERT model.

Result: The study identifies aesthetic preferences, spatial variations, and gaps between tourists' visual expectations versus the environment, while assessing satisfaction across key dimensions like activities, built environment, services, and business formats.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of integrating multimodal data to decode tourist perceptions, aiding informed decisions in tourism, heritage conservation, and public space design.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to evaluate the reliability of Generative AI models using deterministic and AI-generated knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of reliability in Generative AI models, including biases, hallucinations, and lack of transparency in evaluations.

Method: The research constructs and compares deterministic knowledge graphs and dynamically generated knowledge graphs using structured metrics and real-world data streams to measure discrepancies.

Result: The framework can continuously detect semantic anomalies and hallucinations by monitoring structural and semantic deviations through automated methods.

Conclusion: The proposed metric-driven evaluation framework offers a scalable and transparent solution to monitor and enhance the reliability of Generative AI models.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

*Sina Khajehabdollahi,Gautier Hamon,Marko Cvjetko,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Clément Moulin-Frier,Cédric Colas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid exploration method that enhances finding diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata through linguistic goal generation and novelty-driven strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of exploring the vast and redundant behavioral space in continuous cellular automata, where traditional methods like Novelty Search fail to uncover distant, unexplored regions.

Method: E&E alternates between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions, leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic descriptions of hypothetical patterns, guiding exploration in human-perceivable semantic spaces.

Result: E&E outperforms existing exploration methods in discovering diverse solutions when tested on Flow Lenia. Goals originating from expeditions significantly influence long-term exploration by uncovering new behavioral niches.

Conclusion: E&E breaks through local novelty limitations, aligns exploration with human-perceptible semantics, and serves as a promising method for open-ended exploration in artificial life and related domains.

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

TL;DR: This paper presents Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), an AI-powered conversational interface designed to simplify interactions on e-commerce platforms, achieving high success rates and faster task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent complexity of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce platforms creates inefficiencies for users, prompting the need for simpler interaction models.

Method: FaMA leverages Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agentic capabilities to serve as a conversational entry point to the marketplace, automating workflows and enabling intuitive natural language commands.

Result: The proposed assistant, FaMA, achieves a 98% success rate in solving complex tasks and enables users to interact up to 2x faster compared to traditional GUIs.

Conclusion: The integration of an agentic assistant like FaMA into e-commerce platforms demonstrates a promising shift to intuitive, efficient, and accessible user interactions, reducing reliance on complex GUIs.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1, a new medical foundation model, offers interpretability for chest X-ray analysis through a multi-step training process, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models lack interpretability and transparent reasoning, which has hindered their clinical adoption.

Method: DeepMedix-R1 employs a three-stage sequential training pipeline: fine-tuning on CXR-specific datasets, training with synthetic reasoning samples, and refining via online reinforcement learning.

Result: The model showed substantial gains in report generation and visual question answering tasks compared to existing models, including LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma.

Conclusion: DeepMedix-R1 enhances clinical interpretability and reasoning, moving towards practical, transparent AI solutions for chest X-ray interpretation.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel search algorithm for automated planning that explicitly treats numeric control parameters as decision points for more efficient problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing planning approaches treat numeric control parameters as constraints rather than decision points, limiting exploration capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a best-first heuristic search algorithm that uses delayed partial expansion to handle infinite decision spaces defined by numeric control parameters.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, showing its effectiveness in solving planning problems.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers an innovative and efficient alternative for handling control parameters in automated planning, with proven completeness under certain conditions.

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI faces challenges in adapting to novel domains without extensive data collection or retraining.

Method: WorMI integrates reasoning from large language models with domain-specific world models through test-time composition, using prototype-based retrieval and world-wise compound attention to align and apply knowledge.

Result: WorMI achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performance on VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, outperforming other LLM-based methods in unseen domains.

Conclusion: WorMI demonstrates scalable and efficient adaptation for embodied agents in real-world scenarios without requiring significant data or retraining.

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR), a framework that improves language model agents by consolidating reflections into a reusable memory, enhancing their adaptability, safety, and accuracy across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents experience repeated failures, inefficiencies in exploration, and struggles with adapting across tasks despite strong single-task performance. Existing reflective and RL-based methods have limitations in reusability, computational demands, or adaptability.

Method: The approach introduces a Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) structure to store reusable corrective knowledge. It employs soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks (HAC) during inference. Algorithms for the memory's update and application are designed within an AlfWorld-based experimental environment.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that MPR achieves superior execution accuracy and robustness compared to Reflexion baselines. Additionally, rule admissibility enhances the stability of the agents.

Conclusion: MPR externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without altering model weights, reduces unsafe or invalid actions, and enhances adaptability. It outperforms Reflexion systems and introduces avenues for scalability and multimodal/multi-agent research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

*Jinyuan Li,Yi Chu,Yiwen Sun,Mengchuan Zou,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPBO, a novel framework leveraging large language models to automate the optimization of local search solvers for pseudo-Boolean optimization, and shows its significant performance improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual tuning and expert effort needed to design efficient local search solvers in PBO pose limitations, motivating the use of large language models to automate this aspect.

Method: The authors integrate large language models into the framework called AutoPBO to automate the heuristic enhancement of local search solvers for PBO. They conduct experiments across diverse benchmarks alongside comparisons with six state-of-the-art solvers.

Result: AutoPBO significantly improves the performance of traditional local search PBO solvers while maintaining competitive performance against other top-performing approaches.

Conclusion: AutoPBO is a promising method for automating the enhancement of PBO solver design, yielding efficiency gains and reducing the need for expert-driven manual optimization.

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Space, a framework that optimizes reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing multi-step thought processes more effectively than traditional token-level Reinforcement Learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional token-level RL frameworks are misaligned with the reasoning-level, multi-step nature of tasks performed by LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Method: CoT-Space reforms LLM reasoning into a continuous optimization process in a semantic space, analyzed through a noise and risk perspective to achieve balance between underfitting and overfitting.

Result: The framework confirms its validity via extensive experiments, showing natural convergence to an optimal CoT length and explaining phenomena like overthinking.

Conclusion: CoT-Space not only bridges theoretical gaps but also sets a foundation for developing more generalizable and effective reasoning agents for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oruga, a computational system based on Representational Systems Theory (RST), designed to study and execute transformations of representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To equip machines with the flexible representational abilities of humans, enabling diagram creation, representation changes, and cross-domain analogy-making.

Method: Developed Oruga, which includes core data structures based on RST concepts, a communication language, and a structure transfer engine for transformations.

Result: The paper provides an overview of Oruga's core components and demonstrates its functionality through an example transformation.

Conclusion: Oruga offers a computational implementation of RST, showcasing its potential to enable machines to perform representational transformations effectively.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

*Alexander Beiser,David Penz,Nysret Musliu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of formal language selection in enhancing Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning and compares various languages across datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLMs’ formal reasoning abilities and improve neuroscience-inspired reasoning capabilities by examining formal language choices.

Method: Evaluate four formal languages using three datasets and seven LLMs to assess the impact of language selection on reasoning.

Result: Choice of formal language significantly influences both syntactic and semantic reasoning, with variations observed across LLMs.

Conclusion: Selecting an appropriate formal language is critical for optimizing Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning and its application to varied reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

### [30] [Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100)
*Alberto Luise,Michele Lombardi,Florent Teichteil Koenigsbuch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) with search-based path planning to optimize airliner flight paths, achieving faster computation while maintaining near-optimal fuel efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fast route re-calculations during airliner emergencies, combining RL and traditional solvers minimizes computational time.

Method: An RL Agent pre-computes near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data, constraining the search space of traditional path planning solvers.

Result: Empirical analysis shows up to 50% faster computations with fuel consumption deviations within 1% compared to unconstrained optimization.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances computation speed while maintaining near-optimal fuel efficiency, demonstrating its practical application in airliner route optimization.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

### [31] [Analysis of Bluffing by DQN and CFR in Leduc Hold'em Poker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04125)
*Tarik Zaciragic,Aske Plaat,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines bluffing behaviors in computer poker algorithms, DQN and CFR, in Leduc Hold'em, revealing that bluffing is a fundamental aspect of poker regardless of the algorithm used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore bluffing behavior in computer poker algorithms, an often-overlooked aspect in research focused on performance metrics.

Method: The authors design an experiment where DQN and CFR agents play against each other in simplified poker, logging their actions to analyze bluffing tendencies.

Result: Both algorithms exhibit bluffing, with differing rates but similar success percentages in fooling opponents.

Conclusion: Bluffing appears to be an intrinsic part of poker itself, emphasizing the need for further research into bluff styles and the complete poker game.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

### [32] [The human biological advantage over AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04130)
*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper argues that artificial general intelligence (AGI) might surpass human capabilities but lacks a central nervous system (CNS), making it inferior to humans in leadership due to the inability to fully experience emotions and develop sustainable ethical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether AGI, as a 'digital species,' could or should surpass humans in societal and universal leadership.

Method: This is a conceptual analysis comparing AGI's potential future abilities with the distinct capabilities provided by the human CNS.

Result: The paper highlights that AI's lack of a CNS and inability to experience emotion impairs its ability to fully understand ethical consequences or lead effectively.

Conclusion: AI might achieve technical superiority, but humans' DNA and CNS provide unparalleled qualities essential for sustainable leadership in the universe.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure.
Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the
DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and

### [34] [Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192)
*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limit behaviors of probability distributions defined by Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) as the domain size becomes infinite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the asymptotic behaviors and properties of probability distributions defined by MLNs, especially how these behaviors differ under various constraints.

Method: The authors analyze three distinct examples of MLNs, focusing on quantifier-free MLNs, MLNs favoring fewer cliques in graphs, and MLNs favoring lower-degree vertices, while studying their asymptotic limit behaviors.

Result: The analysis reveals varied limit behaviors depending on the constraints used, as well as incomparability between quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks in certain cases.

Conclusion: MLNs exhibit diverse and non-uniform limit behaviors, with certain weight configurations being either influential or negligible. Additionally, MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks differ in representing sequences of probability distributions and diverge significantly from uniform distributions in large domains.

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

### [36] [EvoEmo: Towards Evolved Emotional Policies for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04310)
*Yunbo Long,Liming Xu,Lukas Beckenbauer,Yuhan Liu,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo is a framework designed to improve performance in negotiations by optimizing emotional expression through evolutionary reinforcement learning. It outperforms traditional strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models in negotiation overlook the strategic role of emotions, resulting in vulnerabilities to exploitation.

Method: EvoEmo uses evolutionary reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust emotional expressions, modeled as a Markov Decision Process, optimized through genetic algorithms across different scenarios.

Result: EvoEmo consistently surpasses baseline strategies in negotiation success rates, efficiency, and savings for buyers.

Conclusion: Adaptive emotional responses improve the effectiveness of LLM agents in multi-turn negotiations, showcasing their potential for enhanced interaction.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

### [37] [Improving Robustness of AlphaZero Algorithms to Test-Time Environment Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04317)
*Isidoro Tamassia,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves AlphaZero to handle changes in test environments effectively, even with limited planning resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero assumes a fixed test environment, restricting its applicability when environments change.

Method: The authors propose modifications to the AlphaZero framework for improved adaptability in altered test environments.

Result: Improved AlphaZero performance in variable environments, even with low planning budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances AlphaZero's practicality, and the code is made publicly available.

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for improving Large Language Model agents using personality-based conditioning, demonstrating its application and effectiveness in tasks like communication and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance LLM agents by incorporating psychological theories to create more interpretable and specialized behaviors.

Method: Researchers use MBTI personality archetypes via prompt engineering to prime LLM agents while automating verification through the 16Personalities test.

Result: The framework demonstrates personality-specific behavioral biases and improved task performance (e.g., narrative generation by expressive agents and stable strategies by analytical agents).

Conclusion: The integration of psychological frameworks like MBTI and others help create AI agents with controlled and enhanced behavior, without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

### [39] [ArcMemo: Abstract Reasoning Composition with Lifelong LLM Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04439)
*Matthew Ho,Chen Si,Zhaoxiang Feng,Fangxu Yu,Zhijian Liu,Zhiting Hu,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a memory system for Large Language Models (LLMs) that stores modular and reusable knowledge abstractions instead of instance-based memory. This enables test-time continual learning without needing weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lose valuable insights and patterns generated during inference when the context window resets. To make information retention broad and scalable, the authors sought to create reusable, concept-level memory instead of rigid and instance-based memory.

Method: The authors designed a mechanism to abstract knowledge from reasoning rollouts into modular concepts stored in natural language. For new queries, selective retrieval integrates relevant concepts into the prompt without changing the LLM weights. They also introduced methods for dynamically updating memory during test-time.

Result: On the ARC-AGI benchmark, the method achieved a 7.5% relative increase in performance over the baseline, with results scaling well with increased computational inference. Abstract concepts demonstrated as the most consistent memory framework, and dynamic updates further improved memory utility.

Conclusion: Using abstract, concept-level memory significantly improves reasoning-intensive tasks. Furthermore, allowing test-time updates creates a cycle of self-improvement by solving more problems and continuously enriching the memory.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning inference mapping framework optimizing computation and communication, leading to high hardware efficiency and minimal off-chip memory use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce dependence on I/O, off-chip memory, and host control in deep learning inference, while improving hardware efficiency.

Method: The framework uses predictive planning for computation and communication and employs fine-grained message passing in a programmable, message-based compute architecture, leveraging techniques like stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.

Result: High utilization (88-92%) on VGG-19, with reduced off-chip communication (over 97% of messages generated internally, 89% of time for on-chip transfers), and computation throughput scaling beyond 1 TFLOP/s with significant traffic reduction.

Conclusion: The approach showcases the effectiveness of streaming-based computation and demonstrates how tightly coordinated data and instruction flow enhances hardware execution for deep learning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.

Result: A synthesis of design considerations, optimization strategies, and emerging trends for FPGA solutions tailored to multimodal model deployment.

Conclusion: FPGA solutions can support scalable, portable models, but challenges like benchmarks and runtime flexibility remain. The paper bridges multimodal AI and FPGA efficiency gaps.

Abstract: Transformers and vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as dominant
architectures in computer vision and multimodal AI, offering state-of-the-art
performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, visual

hardware platform for such workloads due to their reconfigurability,
fine-grained parallelism, and potential for energy-efficient acceleration. This
paper presents a comprehensive review of design trade-offs, optimization
strategies, and implementation challenges for FPGA-based inference of
transformers and VLMs. We examine critical factors such as device-class
selection, memory subsystem constraints, dataflow orchestration, quantization
strategies, sparsity exploitation, and toolchain choices, alongside
modality-specific issues unique to VLMs, including heterogeneous compute
balancing and cross-attention memory management. Additionally, we discuss
emerging trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, highlighting innovations in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for efficient object detection in autonomous vehicles, where real-time responses are critical for safety, and to explore the existing knowledge gaps between academic research and commercial implementations.

Method: The paper involves a review of object detection algorithms, specifically focusing on those used in autonomous vehicles, and delves into their hardware accelerators like GPUs and ASICs, showcasing their scalability and computational challenges.

Result: The study highlights that while hundreds of frames per second can be achieved, both algorithms and hardware platforms require further advancements to meet the demands of autonomous vehicles with multiple cameras.

Conclusion: The paper provides valuable insights bridging academic research and commercial applications, offering a reference point for developing future autonomous vehicle technologies with enhanced safety and efficiency.

Abstract: The efficiency of object detectors depends on factors like detection
accuracy, processing time, and computational resources. Processing time is
crucial for real-time applications, particularly for autonomous vehicles (AVs),
where instantaneous responses are vital for safety. This review paper provides
a concise yet comprehensive survey of real-time object detection (OD)
algorithms for autonomous cars delving into their hardware accelerators (HAs).
Non-neural network-based algorithms, which use statistical image processing,
have been entirely substituted by AI algorithms, such as different models of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their intrinsically parallel features led
them to be deployable into edge-based HAs of various types, where GPUs and, to
a lesser extent, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) remain the most
widely used. Throughputs of hundreds of frames/s (fps) could be reached;
however, handling object detection for all the cameras available in a typical
AV requires further hardware and algorithmic improvements. The intensive
competition between AV providers has limited the disclosure of algorithms,
firmware, and even hardware platform details. This remains a hurdle for
researchers, as commercial systems provide valuable insights while academics
undergo lengthy training and testing on restricted datasets and road scenarios.
Consequently, many AV research papers may not be reflected in end products,
being developed under limited conditions. This paper surveys state-of-the-art
OD algorithms and aims to bridge the gap with technologies in commercial AVs.
To our knowledge, this aspect has not been addressed in earlier surveys. Hence,
the paper serves as a tangible reference for researchers designing future
generations of vehicles, expected to be fully autonomous for comfort and
safety.

### [44] [Speech-Based Cognitive Screening: A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Adaptation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03525)
*Fatemeh Taherinezhad,Mohamad Javad Momeni Nezhad,Sepehr Karimi,Sina Rashidi,Ali Zolnour,Maryam Dadkhah,Yasaman Haghbin,Hossein AzadMaleki,Maryam Zolnoori*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares various large language model (LLM) adaptation strategies for detecting dementia using speech-based analysis from the DementiaBank corpus, finding that fine-tuned and structured approaches yield the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 50% of U.S. adults with Alzheimer’s and related dementias remain undiagnosed. Scalable methods, like speech-based screening, can address this gap.

Method: The paper evaluates nine text-only and three multimodal models on speech data, testing techniques such as in-context learning, reasoning prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration.

Result: Class-centroid demonstrations performed best in in-context learning. Reasoning enhancements benefited smaller models, while token-level fine-tuning generally achieved the highest scores. Multimodal models performed well but did not outperform the top text-only models when fine-tuned.

Conclusion: Carefully adapted open-weight language models, with strategies like demonstration selection, reasoning augmentation, and specific fine-tuning techniques, can match or outperform commercial systems in speech-based dementia detection.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [45] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA) framework to improve the performance of Speech-based Large Language Models (SpeechLMs) in instruction-following tasks and other speech-specific applications, using self-synthesized data and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SpeechLMs underperform in handling user speech requests and instruction-following tasks compared to text-based LLMs due to inter-modal discrepancies.

Method: The RBA framework generates high-quality alignment data using a teacher LLM via self-synthesis, then aligns the behaviors of SpeechLMs using reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: RBA achieves enhanced instruction-following capabilities for SpeechLMs, surpassing traditional distillation baselines and demonstrating state-of-the-art performances on benchmarks like spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation.

Conclusion: The self-synthesis and reinforcement learning approach in RBA expands the utility of SpeechLMs across various tasks and improves their linguistic capabilities without relying heavily on human annotations.

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

TL;DR: The paper develops and applies a fine-tuned Mistral 7B model with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for hierarchical cryptocurrency news analysis, utilizing both text and graph summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing cryptocurrency news data by leveraging advanced language model methods, mitigating hallucinations, and enhancing qualitative and quantitative insights.

Method: Hierarchical analytics combining fine-tuned Mistral 7B with RAG for multilevel summarization, using 4-bit quantization via PEFT/LoRA to generate text and graph summaries along with JSON representations.

Result: The approach generates complementary summaries in text and graph formats while successfully minimizing hallucinations, providing informative and consolidated analyses.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned Mistral 7B model proves effective for deep cryptocurrency news analytics, offering robust tools for both qualitative and quantitative insights into news content.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ProLiFIC, a structured event log of Italian lawmaking from 1987 to 2022, developed to integrate Process Mining (PM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal system analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process Mining has proven effective in industrial settings but shows limitations in the legal domain due to dataset quality and accessibility issues. The study aims to address this gap by creating a comprehensive event log specific to the Italian legislative process.

Method: The researchers structured unorganized data sourced from the Normattiva portal using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create ProLiFIC, an organized dataset that supports PM in legal contexts.

Result: They successfully structured decades of data into ProLiFIC, facilitating an initial analysis of Italian legislative procedures and opening pathways for further PM research in legal systems.

Conclusion: ProLiFIC stands as a significant benchmark resource for applying PM to legal systems, uniquely combining LLM structuring capabilities and PM for advancing research in the legal domain.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-modal framework that encodes earnings calls into hierarchical discourse trees, integrating text, audio, video, and metadata for enhanced semantic and structural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis systems fail to capture the layered discourse structure of earnings calls. This paper aims to address this gap by developing a method to model their complex interactions.

Method: The framework uses hierarchical discourse trees, with nodes enriched by emotional signals from text, audio, and video, as well as structural metadata. A two-stage transformer architecture is employed to encode and synthesize hierarchical embeddings.

Result: Experimental results show stable and semantically meaningful representations capturing emotional tone, logic, and theme, generalizable to domains like tele-medicine and political discourse.

Conclusion: This framework provides practical benefits for financial forecasting and discourse evaluation while offering a generalizable method for high-stakes communicative scenarios.

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [49] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model to predict suicidal ideation behaviors (SIB) in adolescents from their online forum activities before they explicitly express suicidal thoughts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adolescent suicide prediction is challenging due to undetected cases stemming from limited mental health contact. Social media presents an opportunity to detect such thoughts early.

Method: The authors developed Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that analyzes sequential user posts and their engagements on forums to predict future SIB without relying on explicit self-disclosure.

Result: The Early-SIB model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.73 in predicting SIB from Dutch youth forum data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of using machine learning tools like Early-SIB as a supplementary approach to traditional suicide detection methods.

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [50] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)
*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination detection in large language models using a scalable and cost-effective method for identifying hallucinated tokens in long responses, focusing on entity-level hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The critical need to prevent hallucinations in high-stakes applications like medical and legal fields motivated the development of a scalable and efficient hallucination detection method.

Method: The researchers annotated model responses with grounded labels to detect hallucinations at the entity level, used web search for this annotation, and trained hallucination classifiers, including linear probes.

Result: Their classifiers outperformed existing baselines, including more costly methods, achieving AUC scores of 0.90 compared to 0.71. Additionally, the classifiers generalized effectively to tasks like mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a viable, scalable methodology for detecting hallucinations, sharing datasets for reuse, and showing applicability across different models and tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [51] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UDIB, a novel algorithm for identifying topics in LLM prompts and responses using an information-theoretic approach to improve detection of hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to responses deviating from the provided context, a phenomenon termed intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations. Current detection methods lack an information-theoretic basis to effectively identify semantic inconsistencies.

Method: The paper develops UDIB, an algorithm grounded in the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB), replacing its computationally prohibitive KL divergence term with an efficient upper bound for practicality. This approach clusters LLM embeddings into maximally informative and coherent topics.

Result: The new approach leads to the creation of shared topic representations for LLM prompts and responses that enhance effectiveness in detecting inconsistencies within the Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM) framework.

Conclusion: The UDIB method provides a robust and entropy-regularized clustering approach, offering a theoretically sound and practical solution to improve the detection of hallucinations in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

TL;DR: This study develops a system for automatic question generation across multiple content formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tailored practice materials despite abundant educational resources.

Method: The paper introduces a system with four components: multi-modal input handling, question generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and an interactive interface.

Result: The project demonstrates the feasibility of an automated and intelligent question generation system.

Conclusion: The system offers a foundation for scalable, efficient, and user-friendly question generation.

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces AR$^2$, a framework utilizing reinforcement learning to improve large language models' abstraction skills, showing enhanced accuracy on complex programming tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of explicit training for abstraction abilities in coding-oriented large language models despite advancements in reinforcement learning for code generation.

Method: AR$^2$ uses a teacher model to convert kernel problems into more complex narrative formats while training a student model to extract and solve the inherent computational logic.

Result: Experimental evidence shows AR$^2$ significantly boosts the accuracy of models on complex, unseen programming challenges.

Conclusion: Cultivating abstraction skills in LLMs is pivotal for improving their generalization ability, which AR$^2$ achieves effectively through its novel training framework.

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [54] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for improving the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by dynamically constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often struggle with factual consistency due to limitations in their parametric memory. Current retrieval methods treat knowledge as unstructured text, limiting compositional reasoning and factual accuracy.

Method: The proposed method extracts a seed KG from the question using prompting, iteratively expands it with the LLM's latent knowledge, and refines it through external retrieval to enhance coverage and correct inaccuracies.

Result: Experiments on three diverse factual QA benchmarks show consistent improvements in factual accuracy, precision, and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Inference-time knowledge graph construction offers a structured, interpretable, and scalable approach for improving the factuality of LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system capable of extracting and aligning motivations, methods, and experimental results across related papers for reconstructing research development chains.

Method: ResearchPulse uses three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task decomposition, a Mmap-Agent for creating motivation-method maps, and a Lchart-Agent for synthesizing experimental line charts. It is supported by a benchmark dataset called ResearchPulse-Bench.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as GPT-4o, in semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual fidelity using 7B-scale agents.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse provides a structured, effective approach for scientific inference over paper clusters, aiding the analysis and visualization of research trends and developments.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

of large language models has accelerated the development of AI-assisted tools,
yet existing solutions often struggle with efficiency. We present NoteBar, an

and semantic richness for downstream tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that
NoteBar can be deployed in a practical and cost-effective manner, enabling
interactive use without reliance on heavy infrastructure. Together, NoteBar and
its accompanying dataset provide a scalable and extensible foundation for
advancing AI-assisted personal knowledge management.

*Aryan Gupta,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates state-of-the-art LVLMs and traditional OCR systems on multilingual and noisy datasets, finding Sprinklr-Edge-OCR to be the most efficient and cost-effective for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in OCR performance on real-world multilingual, noisy, and diverse images, especially in resource-constrained deployment environments.

Method: Conducted benchmarking of five LVLMs and two traditional OCR systems on multilingual images across metrics like accuracy, language coverage, efficiency, and deployment cost, including edge case CPU analysis.

Result: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR achieved the best F1 score (0.46), demonstrated high efficiency (35x faster processing), and was very low-cost (0.006 USD per 1,000 images). It surpassed LVLMs like Qwen in deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Traditional OCR systems like Sprinklr-Edge-OCR are better suited for edge deployment environments due to their superior efficiency, reduced computational demands, and affordability compared to LVLMs.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models exhibit bias favoring their own output, and steering vectors can mitigate unjustified bias, though limitations remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and reliability issues in LLM evaluation pipelines arising from self-preference bias.

Method: Developing a dataset to classify self-preference bias and deploying steering vectors using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and optimization methods.

Result: Steering vectors decreased unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97%, outperforming other approaches but showed instability on legitimate preference cases.

Conclusion: While steering vectors show promise in mitigating bias, their instability highlights the need for more robust solutions for use in LLM evaluation contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [59] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence and semantic similarity using the MIMIC-IV database, leveraging embeddings like ClinicalBERT and BioBERT. It shows weak correlation but complementary utility between these approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing unstructured clinical notes at scale and explore relationships between SNOMED CT concepts through co-occurrence and semantic similarity.

Method: The study uses NPMI to analyze co-occurrence patterns and pretrained embeddings (such as ClinicalBERT and BioBERT) to determine semantic similarity. It explores patterns temporally, across specialties, and for suggesting missing concepts.

Result: The study finds weak correlation between co-occurrence patterns and semantic similarity. However, embeddings reveal meaningful clinical associations, suggest missing content, and cluster concepts into coherent clinical themes, linking to patient outcomes like mortality and readmission.

Conclusion: The complementary use of co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings can enhance clinical documentation, uncover latent relationships, and inform decision-making and phenotyping.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

*Parush Gera,Tempestt Neal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel approach called MLSD improves stance detection across domains and targets using metric learning with triplet loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective stance detection across domains and targets, which is challenging due to semantic variations.

Method: MLSD employs metric learning with triplet loss to create a discriminative embedding space for enhancing stance detection via domain adaptation.

Result: Statistical improvement in stance detection across six models and multiple datasets.

Conclusion: MLSD demonstrates effective cross-domain and cross-target stance detection, leveraging semantic similarity through metric learning.

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

### [61] [SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiLVERScore, a novel metric to robustly and semantically evaluate sign language generation, addressing the limitations of existing methods reliant on back-translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sign language evaluation methods rely on back-translation, which fails to integrate multimodal features and introduces ambiguity regarding error sources.

Method: The researchers proposed SiLVERScore, a semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that operates in a joint embedding space to evaluate sign language generation.

Result: SiLVERScore demonstrated near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs, achieving high metrics like ROC AUC = 0.99 and outperforming traditional evaluation methods on datasets like PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily.

Conclusion: SiLVERScore successfully addresses evaluation flaws by offering robust and semantically-aware assessments for sign language generation, providing improved accuracy and generalization insights.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [62] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a four-metric suite to evaluate large vision language models (VLMs) in interactive grounding settings, comparing performance to human dyads in referential games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of VLMs focus on single-turn or question-answering settings, missing the interactive nature of grounding in communication.

Method: Developed and deployed a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, human-likeness) on 150 self-play sessions of referential games between three VLMs, comparing results to human dyads.

Result: All VLMs tested deviated from human performance in at least three metrics, with GPT4o-mini performing closest to humans.

Conclusion: Task success scores and image-utterance alignment alone are insufficient for measuring grounding; the introduced metric suite provides a systematic framework for analyzing VLM grounding performance in interactive settings.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

*Jiaxin Guo,Daimeng Wei,Yuanchang Luo,Xiaoyu Chen,Zhanglin Wu,Huan Yang,Hengchao Shang,Zongyao Li,Zhiqiang Rao,Jinlong Yang,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework, 'Align-then-Slide,' for document-level machine translation (doc-mt) generated by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods are inadequate for assessing whole-document outputs of new-era document-level machine translation generated by LLMs.

Method: The proposed method involves two stages: (1) Align - reconstruct target documents to resolve sentence correspondence issues, and (2) n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate - perform multi-granularity evaluation using averaged metric scores.

Result: The method achieves high Pearson correlation with expert MQM rankings (0.929) and aligns closely with human judgments on a curated real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Align-then-Slide is validated as an accurate, robust, and effective evaluation tool, and its output enables improved model training and reward mechanisms for doc-mt.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

### [64] [NE-PADD: Leveraging Named Entity Knowledge for Robust Partial Audio Deepfake Detection via Attention Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03829)
*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces NE-PADD, a novel method for frame-level Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that uses named entity semantics to locate fake speech segments in audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial Audio Deepfake Detection is more challenging than sentence-level detection, as it requires identifying specific fake speech frames. Leveraging semantic information like named entities in audio remains underexplored.

Method: The authors propose NE-PADD, a dual-branch system integrating SpeechNER and PADD, using Attention Fusion (AF) and Attention Transfer (AT) to combine and guide attention mechanisms. They use auxiliary loss to incorporate named entity knowledge into the detection process.

Result: Their approach, tested on the PartialSpoof-NER dataset, demonstrates better performance compared to existing baselines, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Integrating named entity semantics significantly enhances frame-level Partial Audio Deepfake Detection. The proposed NE-PADD method is a promising step in improving detection accuracy, offering new insights into this challenging area.

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

### [65] [Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03867)
*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Drivelology, a synthetic linguistic phenomenon encoding implicit meanings, challenges existing large language models (LLMs), showing their limitations in pragmatic understanding. A benchmark dataset of over 1,200 curated examples is introduced for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the need to understand and challenge the capabilities of LLMs in grasping 'nonsense with depth,' where syntactically coherent utterances encode pragmatic, emotional, or moral layers beyond surface-level fluency.

Method: The authors created a benchmark dataset containing 1,200 curated examples in six languages, conducting thorough annotation processes involving multiple rounds of expert review. They evaluated LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning within Drivelological contexts.

Result: The findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs, which fail to recognize Drivelological text as distinct from shallow nonsense, produce inadequate justifications, and misunderstand implied rhetorical functions.

Conclusion: LLMs lack in-depth pragmatic understanding despite their linguistic fluency. The research underscores the importance of developing models that go beyond statistical patterns to achieve cognitive comprehension. The study’s dataset and code are shared for the community to drive further innovation.

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

### [66] [A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthiness in Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03871)
*Yanbo Wang,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys the trustworthiness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models, analyzing five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how CoT reasoning impacts the trustworthiness of language models.

Method: The authors provide chronological overviews and detailed analyses of recent research on CoT models and methodologies.

Result: The study finds that while reasoning techniques improve trustworthiness, they can introduce or exacerbate vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy.

Conclusion: This survey highlights both the promise and risks of CoT reasoning, aiming to guide future work in enhancing trustworthy AI reasoning practices.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

*Cheng Wang,Zeming Wei,Qin Liu,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critically reassesses probing-based safety detection in LLMs, revealing its reliance on superficial cues rather than true semantic understanding, which leads to poor reliability in identifying harmful instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns posed by LLMs complying with malicious instructions, and evaluate the efficacy of existing safety probing methods.

Method: Conduct controlled experiments comparing probing methods with n-gram approaches, create semantically cleaned datasets, and analyze pattern dependencies to assess the authenticity of learned harmfulness detection.

Result: Probing methods learn superficial patterns like instructional cues and trigger words and fail to generalize across different datasets, casting doubt on their reliability.

Conclusion: Current probing-based approaches give a deceptive sense of security; the paper advocates redesigning models and evaluation protocols for more responsible harm detection and provides guidelines for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG is a framework designed to address limitations in current LLM-based mobile agents by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), improving task accuracy and efficiency in mobile environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mobile agents have issues such as errors from misoperations, inability to interact with external environments, and lack memory capabilities.

Method: The MobileRAG framework combines InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG to utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation for better parsing, task execution, and memory capabilities. Additionally, MobileRAG-Eval benchmark assesses its performance in complex, real-world tasks requiring external knowledge.

Result: MobileRAG achieved a 10.3% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods on MobileRAG-Eval benchmark, with fewer operational steps.

Conclusion: MobileRAG effectively handles real-world mobile tasks, demonstrating its potential as an improved LLM-based mobile agent framework.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Matrix of Thought (MoT) and its QA framework (MTQA) to improve reasoning in LLMs for complex questions, outperforming existing methods while being efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show degraded performance in complex and abstract question answering tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities.

Method: The Matrix of Thought (MoT) uses a column-cell communication mechanism for structured thinking, paired with a fact-correction mechanism using knowledge units from graphs and text sources.

Result: Their QA framework (MTQA) surpasses state-of-the-art methods with higher F1 and exact match (EM) scores across four datasets, while maintaining reasoning time to only 14.4% of baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances LLM reasoning, reduces redundancy, improves accuracy, and delivers efficiency in complex QA tasks.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

*Iro Lim,Haein Ji,Byungjun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KPoEM, a new dataset for emotion analysis in Korean poetry, and fine-tunes a language model that outperforms previous ones in emotional interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited computational exploration of emotions in Korean poetry due to challenges like figurative language and cultural specificity.

Method: The authors created a multi-label dataset of 7,662 annotated entries from Korean poetry, encompassing 44 fine-grained emotion categories, and fine-tuned a state-of-the-art Korean language model on this dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed previous models by achieving 0.60 F1-micro, compared to 0.34 from general corpus-trained models. It also excelled at temporal and cultural emotional identification in Korean poetry.

Conclusion: The study advances computational literary analysis by developing a method to quantitatively explore and preserve emotional and cultural nuances in Korean poetry through structured datasets.

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SelfAug, a strategy aimed at mitigating catastrophic forgetting in large language models during fine-tuning by aligning input sequence logits to preserve semantic distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for catastrophic forgetting either rely on general instruction data, leading to distribution mismatches, or fail to adequately preserve original model capabilities. Addressing this gap is critical for improving LLMs’ performance across downstream tasks without compromising their general capabilities.

Method: The proposed method, SelfAug, focuses on self-distribution alignment where input sequence logits are aligned to maintain the semantic distribution of the model during fine-tuning.

Result: SelfAug effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and enhances downstream task performance, as demonstrated by extensive empirical experiments. It establishes a correlation between distribution shifts and catastrophic forgetting severity in Retrieval-Augmented Generation scenarios.

Conclusion: SelfAug represents a significant step forward in combating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs, offering both practical solutions and insights into fine-tuning scenarios. By preserving semantic distributions, it ensures a balance between learned task performance and general capability retention.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

### [72] [SPFT-SQL: Enhancing Large Language Model for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Self-Play Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03937)
*Yuhao Zhang,Shaoming Duan,Jinhang Su,Chuanyi Liu,Peiyi Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN) for the Text-to-SQL task by introducing a novel method, SPFT-SQL, which involves verification-based iterative fine-tuning and error-driven loss adjustment to improve SQL generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN struggles in Text-to-SQL tasks due to the lack of novel information generation and the overwhelming number of correct SQL queries from the opponent model reducing the main model's accuracy.

Method: The authors propose SPFT-SQL, featuring a verification-based iterative fine-tuning process to synthesize high-quality data, build competency across models, and employ error-driven loss during self-play to distinguish and learn from incorrect SQL outputs.

Result: Experiments conducted on six open-source LLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that SPFT-SQL achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL significantly enhances the ability of large language models to generate accurate SQL queries, addressing the limitations of traditional SPIN approaches.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to

*Weihao Wu,Liang Cao,Xinyu Wu,Zhiwei Lin,Rui Niu,Jingbei Li,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops 'VoxRole,' a benchmark for evaluating speech-based Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) by incorporating critical speech features and character consistency metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of evaluation benchmarks and the absence of paralinguistic feature integration (intonation, prosody, rhythm) in existing RPCA research hinders the development of models capable of maintaining persona consistency.

Method: The authors propose VoxRole, created through a two-stage pipeline that aligns movie audio with scripts and uses LLMs to systematically generate detailed character profiles. This benchmark contains 13335 dialogues extracted from 261 movies.

Result: Using VoxRole, a multi-dimensional evaluation of current spoken dialogue models is conducted, uncovering strengths and weaknesses, particularly in persona consistency maintenance.

Conclusion: VoxRole is a significant advancement in setting standards for evaluating speech-based RPCAs and enhancing their persona consistency by integrating paralinguistic features into performance assessment.

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

*Ruiling Guo,Xinwei Yang,Chen Huang,Tong Zhang,Yong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents CANDY, a benchmark to assess large language models (LLMs) for fact-checking Chinese misinformation, showcasing their limitations yet potential in aiding humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation, given their growing applications.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of ~20k annotated instances and analyzed LLM fact-checking performance, including enhancements like chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. They also developed a taxonomy to identify common failures such as factual fabrication.

Result: Current LLMs face challenges in accurate fact-checking, with the most prevalent failure being factual fabrication. Nonetheless, they exhibit promise as tools to support human performance.

Conclusion: LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking but hold considerable potential when used as assistive tools. The dataset and analysis provide a foundation for further research in this area.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper creates synthetic NLP datasets for Ladin, a low-resource language, using Italian data and shows improvements in translation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets and resources for extremely low-resource languages like Ladin, hindering their NLP development.

Method: Utilized a small set of parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs to generate synthetic data for sentiment analysis and MCQA via translation, backed by filtering and back-translation.

Result: Incorporating synthetic datasets significantly improved Italian-Ladin translation baselines compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The first sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin are made available, providing vital foundational resources for further NLP work in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

*Zhaoyan Gong,Juan Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA is a new framework for temporal knowledge graph question answering that enhances reasoning without requiring training, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TKGQA methods face limitations in handling complex temporal queries, reasoning abilities, and error propagation, motivating the need for a novel approach.

Method: RTQA uses recursive thinking to break down questions into sub-problems solved bottom-up with LLMs and TKG knowledge, featuring a Temporal Question Decomposer, Recursive Solver, and Answer Aggregator.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements in Hits@1 performance on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks for complex question categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RTQA offers a training-free solution for enhanced TKG reasoning, presenting a reliable method with improved fault tolerance and impactful advancements in TKGQA domains.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Riccardo Lunardi,Vincenzo Della Mea,Stefano Mizzaro,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how linguistic variability affects Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance by using paraphrased benchmark questions, observing notable declines in effectiveness while highlighting limitations of current benchmark evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether LLMs can maintain effectiveness across paraphrased questions and whether benchmark-based evaluations reliably capture model robustness in real-world applications.

Method: Systematically generate paraphrases for questions across six benchmarks and evaluate 34 state-of-the-art LLMs for changes in effectiveness and stability of rankings.

Result: While LLM rankings remain stable, absolute effectiveness scores drop significantly under paraphrased inputs, revealing challenges with linguistic variability and limitations in benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant performance declines with paraphrased inputs, raising concerns about their generalization and emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmark evaluations to better reflect real-world use cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper investigates model output consistency across languages using the model similarity metric $\,kappa_p$, revealing that larger models show increased cross-lingual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the consistency of outputs generated by models across multiple languages, especially as the model's size and capabilities scale.

Method: The study uses the model similarity metric $\,kappa_p$ on 20 languages and 47 subjects from GlobalMMLU to measure cross-lingual output consistency.

Result: Findings indicate that larger, more capable models become increasingly consistent across languages. Additionally, models are more internally consistent cross-lingually than they are consistent with other models in the same language.

Conclusion: The $\,kappa_p$ metric serves as a valuable tool to assess multilingual reliability and could steer the creation of more consistent multilingual models.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

*Han Xiaohui,Zhang Yunlong,Guo Yuxi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an automatic annotation model for Chinese functional syntax based on RoBERTa, achieving an F1 score of 0.852 and demonstrating strong performance in core syntactic element recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of an automatic annotation system for Chinese texts that applies Systemic Functional Grammar, hindering its application in relevant linguistic studies.

Method: The researchers annotated 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus using functional syntax theory to create a training dataset. They fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model for named entity recognition.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.852 on the test set, outperforming other models, especially in identifying elements like Subject, Main Verb, and Complement, despite challenges with imbalanced label samples.

Conclusion: The study pioneers the integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, offering a novel automated method for analyzing Chinese functional syntax and setting a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory, providing benchmarks and training data for evaluating and improving Large Language Models (LLMs) in sheet music interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks evaluation benchmarks and training data for teaching LLMs and MLLMs to reason with sheet music, which is a barrier to developing AI musicians.

Method: The authors developed a data synthesis framework generating verifiable sheet music questions in textual and visual modalities, creating SSMR-Bench and a training dataset.

Result: Evaluation shows that reasoning abilities are crucial for sheet music interpretation. Improved performance is observed in trained models using synthetic data, surpassing GPT-4 in some benchmarks. Enhanced reasoning supports both sheet music understanding and music composition.

Conclusion: Synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory is an effective strategy, enabling advancements in AI models' capabilities for sheet music reasoning and facilitating new possibilities in AI-driven music creation.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the current state of Arabic chatbots in education, especially given their limited application compared to English counterparts.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive survey analyzing existing Arabic educational chatbots for approaches, language specifics, and performance metrics.

Result: The paper finds research gaps in modern technique adoption for Arabic educational chatbots despite the success seen in English chatbots.

Conclusion: While Arabic chatbots in education show potential, more research and adoption of advanced techniques are needed for significant progress.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19

to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enhances bias detection in narratives using fine-tuned models for classification and explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with subtle language and hidden messaging in narratives and biases.

Method: Fine-tuning BERT for multi-label classification and using GPT-4o for prediction consistency; ReACT framework for narrative explanations.

Result: Improved classification accuracy and justification reliability by integrating auxiliary knowledge and semantic prompting.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance factual accuracy and relevance in narrative analysis, applicable in media and intelligence.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

TL;DR: This study focuses on constructing personalized lexical profiles to enable lexical alignment in conversational agents, analyzing profile stability and performance using limited transcribed speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lexical alignment contributes to successful communication, but its application to conversational agents, especially those using large language models (LLMs), is underexplored.

Method: Profiles were created using transcribed speech data, varying amounts of data and lexical items per part-of-speech category. Profile performance was evaluated using metrics like recall, coverage, and cosine similarity.

Result: Compact profiles based on 10 minutes of speech with specific item allocations across POS categories (e.g., 5 adjectives, 10 nouns) demonstrated optimal balance in data efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidelines for creating stable, personalized lexical profiles, serving as a step towards implementing lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods for coherence assessment by jointly modeling entities and discourse relations, showing improved results when combining both features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance coherence modeling in linguistics by overcoming the limitation of existing models which typically focus on either entities or discourse relations but not both.

Method: The study proposes and evaluates two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations for assessing coherence.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that integrating entity and discourse relation features significantly improves the performance of coherence models.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling both entities and discourse relations is more effective for coherence evaluation, thus emphasizing the importance of combining these features.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT introduces a multi-agent framework for creating synthetic psychological counseling sessions, outperforming single-agent models and improving LLM capabilities in therapeutic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scalable psychological counseling solutions using high-quality synthetic data to enhance open-source LLMs, given the scarcity of privacy-compliant real-world data.

Method: MAGneT leverages multiple specialized LLM agents to generate counselor responses based on various psychological techniques. A new unified evaluation framework with nine aspects of assessment further improves the evaluation robustness.

Result: MAGneT-generated counseling sessions outperformed baseline methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment. Experts preferred MAGneT sessions in 77.2% of cases, and models fine-tuned using MAGneT data showed significant skill improvements.

Conclusion: MAGneT advances synthetic psychological counseling data generation, enabling better fine-tuned models and enhancing the therapeutic alignment of LLMs. Public release of code and data ensures broader adoption.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SED-Aug, a dual augmentation framework combining text-based and feature-space augmentations to enhance social event detection performance on Twitter datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved social event detection arises from the costly and labor-intensive process of manually annotating social media data.

Method: The paper presents a dual augmentation approach, including explicit text augmentation using large language models and implicit feature-space augmentation with five novel perturbation techniques.

Result: SED-Aug improves the average F1 score by 17.67% on the Twitter2012 dataset and 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset compared to the best baseline model.

Conclusion: The proposed SED-Aug framework significantly enhances data diversity, model robustness, and performance in social event detection tasks.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Inverse IFEval, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to adapt to adversarial and unconventional instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with cognitive inertia, where they fail to adapt to instructions that conflict with their standardized training patterns. This paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark comprising eight types of cognitive challenges and 1012 high-quality questions in English and Chinese. The evaluation leverages optimized LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and employs human-in-the-loop methodologies.

Result: Experiments show that existing LLMs underperform on this benchmark, proving the need for Inverse IFEval and demonstrating the limitations in current LLM adaptability.

Conclusion: Future efforts should focus on reducing cognitive inertia and enhancing LLM adaptability to unconventional instructions, using tools such as Inverse IFEval to diagnose and improve instruction-following reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

*Juraj Vladika,Mahdi Dhaini,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) may rely on outdated medical data, risking inaccurate recommendations. Two new QA datasets—MedRevQA and MedChangeQA—assess this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks posed by LLMs using obsolete medical knowledge and improve their reliability in evolving clinical scenarios.

Method: Developed two QA datasets: MedRevQA (general biomedical knowledge) and MedChangeQA (knowledge reflecting changes in medical consensus), then evaluated eight LLMs for reliance on outdated data.

Result: All tested LLMs exhibited dependence on outdated medical knowledge; analysis showed pre-training data and strategies as key factors.

Conclusion: It’s critical to mitigate outdated knowledge reliance in LLMs to build more adaptable and trustworthy medical AI systems.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO enhances contextual ASR performance with phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, and hierarchical filtering, achieving impressive error reduction in multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of ASR systems with domain-specific named entities and inherent limitations in phoneme diversity and entity independence.

Method: Proposes PARCO, a framework combining phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive disambiguation, entity supervision, and filtering techniques.

Result: PARCO achieved significant improvements in error metrics (CER and WER) and demonstrated robust performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: PARCO effectively improves recognition of domain-specific entities in ASR systems and showcases robustness against distractors and in varying domains.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [92] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gender bias in LLMs varies significantly depending on prompt conditions and metrics used for evaluation, highlighting challenges in consistent bias measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender bias in socially impactful applications of LLMs raises concerns, necessitating reliable methods to measure and mitigate such bias.

Method: The paper evaluated LLMs under various prompt designs, examining sensitivity to testing context and gender-focused content across different task formats and metrics.

Result: Minor changes in prompt design significantly affected measured gender bias, with discrete-choice metrics amplifying bias compared to probabilistic measures.

Conclusion: LLM gender bias evaluations are highly sensitive to testing designs, raising questions about ecological validity and the potential for ‘testing mode’ performance in benchmarks.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

*Mutsumi Sasaki,Go Kamoda,Ryosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Sato,Kentaro Inui,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates language models (LMs) on their handling of the Japanese calendar, revealing significant struggles in reasoning and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in evaluating language models’ capabilities in handling culturally specific non-Gregorian calendar systems.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates language models using datasets designed for four tasks requiring temporal knowledge and reasoning in the Japanese calendar.

Result: Language models show mixed performance; some handle calendar conversion well, but most struggle with arithmetic and consistency in the Japanese calendar.

Conclusion: There is a need for improved language models that can better understand culture-specific calendar systems like the Japanese calendar.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GFP, a novel framework for skeleton-based action recognition using high-level feature prediction instead of low-level reconstruction, increasing efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address computational inefficiencies and limited semantic representation in skeleton-based action recognition methods, which traditionally focus on reconstructing low-level features like raw joint coordinates.

Method: The paper introduces a General Feature Prediction (GFP) framework using a lightweight target generation network that dynamically produces supervision signals at different spatial-temporal levels. This avoids reliance on pre-computed features and uses constrained optimization for feature diversity.

Result: The proposed GFP method achieves 6.2x faster training than standard methods and sets state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets in action recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The GFP framework not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the semantic representation quality, making it a superior approach for masked skeleton action recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Susan Done,Dimitrios Androutsos,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of mitotic figure detection and classification using AI, proposing a unified framework with robust performance across domain shifts and class imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists face difficulty in counting mitotic figures due to time constraints and inter-observer variability. AI solutions promise consistent decision-making but suffer from domain shifts and data imbalance in the detection of mitoses.

Method: The paper uses a teacher-student UNet segmentation model augmented by contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training to address domain shift challenges. A multi-task learning paradigm employs a multi-scale CNN classifier leveraging feature maps from segmentation for both detection and classification tasks.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection and a balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification on a preliminary test set.

Conclusion: Integrating segmentation and classification into a unified framework with domain generalization improves robustness and effectiveness in mitosis detection and classification.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [96] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a framework addressing overlapping biases in visual recognition tasks, improving robustness and fairness of vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models struggle with overlapping biases in real-world images, hampering robustness and fairness. Mitigating biases individually worsens the issue by intensifying others.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage process: Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) to force models to learn biases deliberately, followed by Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning to prune bias-related gradients. Additionally, Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) is proposed as a metric to disentangle model-induced bias from distributional shifts.

Result: Experiments on FB-CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO show improvements in worst-group accuracy, reduction of bias amplification, and robust performance under complex biases and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GMBM is a practical, scalable solution for mitigating multi-attribute biases in visual recognition, setting new benchmarks in bias reduction while handling challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a lightweight U-Net model for real-time, accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography, achieving comparable performance to nnU-Net but with significantly reduced size and faster processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying a faster and smaller model for left ventricle segmentation in echocardiography, as current models like nnU-Net are too large for real-time use.

Method: The authors conducted an ablation study on nnU-Net, varying parameters like data augmentation, architecture, loss functions, and post-processing, then used findings to construct a lightweight U-Net model with optimized components.

Result: The lightweight U-Net achieved comparable performance to nnU-Net on the CAMUS dataset with improved efficiency, being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster in processing. This was further validated on a separate dataset.

Conclusion: Simple modifications like affine augmentations and deep supervision are sufficient for effective segmentation, enabling development of a lightweight, efficient U-Net model for real-time applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revises the treeX algorithm for efficient and unsupervised tree instance segmentation from 3D laser scanning data, outperforming deep learning alternatives in runtime and accuracy in specific datasets and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional laser scanning methods require costly resources and large annotated datasets for tree segmentation. The authors aim to develop a resource-efficient alternative.

Method: The authors enhanced the treeX algorithm by implementing clustering-based stem detection and region growing for crown delineation. They also provided parameter presets for different scanning techniques and evaluated its performance across six public datasets.

Result: The revised treeX algorithm exhibited significant improvements in runtime and accuracy compared to the original version and other methods. F$_1$ scores increased by +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based scanning, and the updated algorithm successfully segmented tree instances in UAV-borne datasets where the original failed.

Conclusion: This revised algorithm serves as an efficient alternative to deep learning methods in specific data scenarios, also aiding in the semi-automatic generation of labels for deep learning models, and is provided as an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reg3D, a geometry-supervised framework for improving 3D scene understanding in multimodal models by enforcing explicit reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing 3D scene understanding capabilities within Large Multimodal Models, addressing the limitations of text-only supervision.

Method: Incorporates geometry-aware supervision into the training via dual-supervision (object-level & frame-level tasks) within a dual-encoder architecture.

Result: Reg3D significantly improves performance in benchmark tasks like ScanQA and ScanRefer, showing its efficacy for spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a novel training paradigm for multimodal models, offering robust 3D spatial representation by enforcing geometric consistency.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past V2X systems emphasize accuracy but overlook practicality, efficiency, and deployability in resource-constrained settings.

Method: QuantV2X employs an end-to-end quantization strategy for neural network models and message representations to reduce computational and transmission costs.

Result: QuantV2X achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision systems while reducing latency by 3.2× and increasing mAP30 by +9.5.

Conclusion: QuantV2X proves the viability of quantized multi-agent systems for real-world applications and will be publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of utilizing deep learning models for plant species classification based on leaf venation, a key morphological feature.

Method: The Swedish Leaf Dataset (1,125 images from 15 species) was used to train and test ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0. Performance metrics like accuracy and F1 score were recorded.

Result: EfficientNetB0 achieved the highest testing accuracy (94.67%) and F1 score (>94.6%), outperforming ResNet50 (88.45% test accuracy, 87.82% F1) and MobileNetV2 (93.34% test accuracy, 93.23% F1).

Conclusion: EfficientNetB0 demonstrates superior performance and robust generalization, making it the most suitable model for automated plant taxonomy based on leaf venation patterns.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using

*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LayoutGKN, an efficient method for graph-based floor plan comparison that improves speed while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency in graph-based floor plan comparison caused by costly node-level cross-graph interactions in existing methods like graph matching networks.

Method: LayoutGKN delays cross-graph node-level interactions until the end by leveraging a differentiable graph kernel as the distance function on the final learned embeddings.

Result: LayoutGKN achieves similar or superior similarity computation compared to graph matching networks, while offering significantly faster inference times.

Conclusion: LayoutGKN offers an innovative and efficient solution for floor plan graph comparison, making it suitable for faster and accurate applications like search and clustering.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that

### [103] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD is proposed as a parameter-efficient adaptation technique for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP using singular value decomposition, modifying only 0.04% of the model's total parameters to deliver state-of-the-art fine-tuned performance on natural and biomedical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained domains is challenging due to reliance on prompt engineering and the cost and complexity of full model fine-tuning, potentially undermining their pretraining knowledge.

Method: CLIP-SVD employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to fine-tune only the singular values of CLIP's parameter matrices, avoiding additional modules to preserve the pretrained model's knowledge while enabling domain adaptation.

Result: CLIP-SVD delivers state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization on 21 datasets, including natural and biomedical domains, achieving parameter efficiency with only 0.04% of the model's parameters being updated.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD effectively adapts CLIP to new domains with minimal parameter modifications while maintaining the generalization ability, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STA-Net, optimized for edge devices, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in diagnosing plant diseases using novel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying high-precision deep learning models for plant disease diagnosis on edge devices, while improving attention mechanisms for subtle pathological features.

Method: DeepMAD is used to design an efficient backbone, coupled with the Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM), which splits attention into shape-awareness (via deformable convolutions) and texture-awareness (via Gabor filters).

Result: STA-Net achieves 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96% on the CCMT plant disease dataset, with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs.

Conclusion: Decoupled attention incorporating domain knowledge significantly enhances edge-deployed precision agriculture AI, validated by experimental results and ablation studies.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

### [105] [SLENet: A Guidance-Enhanced Network for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03786)
*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, SLENet, for detecting underwater camouflaged objects using a new benchmark dataset, DeepCamo, to overcome challenges like optical distortions and complex marine traits. It shows superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical yet underexplored task of detecting underwater camouflaged objects that are hard to identify due to environmental challenges, which is vital for marine ecology.

Method: The authors propose Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet) with unique modules, including Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) and Localization Guidance Branch (LGB), to improve multi-scale feature representation and object localization.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that SLENet achieves superior detection performance on the proposed DeepCamo dataset and other benchmark camouflaged object detection datasets.

Conclusion: SLENet is a robust and high-performing framework that improves underwater camouflaged object detection, showcasing general applicability to broader camouflaged object tasks.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [106] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new training strategy leveraging temporal inductive bias in videos for diffusion models, resulting in faster convergence and better generative diversity without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static images used in diffusion model training lack temporal information, leading to slower training, limited coverage, and reduced generalization.

Method: The authors propose training diffusion models using continuous video frames to incorporate temporal inductive bias while retaining standard model architecture.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates more than 2x faster convergence, improved distributional coverage (lower FID), and enhanced generative diversity.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal coherence in video frames during training improves diffusion model performance in terms of efficiency, generalization, and diversity.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D is a novel framework for 3D CT scan analysis addressing diagnostic errors by aligning fine-grained representations and improving semantic consistency in reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address radiologic diagnostic errors caused by under-reading, inattentional blindness, and communication issues, which are worsened by 3D imaging complexity.

Method: The paper introduces MedVista3D, which combines multi-scale semantic vision-language pretraining, local-global image-text alignment, and a Semantic Matching Bank for enhanced text alignment.

Result: MedVista3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like zero-shot classification, report retrieval, VQA, and transfers well to segmentation and prognosis tasks.

Conclusion: MedVista3D successfully addresses existing challenges in 3D medical imaging by enabling precise detection, contextual reasoning, and semantic accuracy in reporting.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [108] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CaPL, a text prompt learning method for CLIP aiming to improve fine-grained recognition by utilizing visual granulation and causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods struggle with fine-grained datasets, necessitating an improved approach for capturing subtle class differences.

Method: The proposed CaPL method incorporates two main modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module using Brownian Bridge Diffusion to separate individualized and non-individualized visual attributes; (2) A granule learning module that applies causal inference to create visual granules and enhance discriminative text prompts.

Result: The CaPL method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art prompt learning techniques across 15 datasets, particularly excelling in fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: CaPL effectively tackles the challenge of fine-grained recognition for CLIP by leveraging visual granulation and causal inference, setting a new benchmark in prompt learning performance.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event-camera-based framework for turbulence mitigation, significantly outperforming existing methods in efficiency and restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high computational/storage demand of current deep-learning turbulence mitigation techniques and leverage the high temporal resolution of event cameras.

Method: Introduce the 'event-lucky insight' to link turbulence distortions with event streams, propose the EGTM framework for better turbulence-free fusion, and develop the first real-world event-driven turbulence mitigation dataset.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in model size (710x smaller), inference latency (214x faster), and complexity (224x lower), while also improving restoration quality (+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM).

Conclusion: Integrating event cameras into turbulence mitigation tasks provides drastic improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, marking a new direction for further research and applications.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba proposes adaptive feature sparsification and fusion techniques for RGB-Event detection to improve performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods uniformly process low-information regions in RGB and event data, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal performance.

Method: FocusMamba introduces Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) for adaptive token selection and Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) for integrating complementary features.

Result: FocusMamba achieves better accuracy and efficiency than existing methods on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive sparsification and effective multimodal feature fusion can enhance accuracy and computational efficiency in RGB-Event detection systems.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR) to address the challenges in recognizing unseen food categories. They propose "SalientFusion," leveraging two components (SalientFormer and DebiasAT) to handle redundant background, role confusion, and semantic bias, achieving strong results on new and standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to recognize unseen food categories due to the rapid emergence of new dishes, aligning with Zero-Shot Food Learning.

Method: They propose "SalientFusion," which combines SalientFormer to address background redundancy and role confusion, and DebiasAT to mitigate semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features.

Result: Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the introduced benchmarks (CZSFood-90, CZSFood-164) and standard CZSL datasets.

Conclusion: "SalientFusion" effectively addresses key challenges in CZSFR, advancing zero-shot and compositional learning tasks for food recognition.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing OccTENS, a generative model for long-term 3D occupancy sequence generation, addressing inefficiency, temporal degradation, and controllability issues using a novel temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in generating fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution in occupancy world models, which current autoregressive methods fail to handle efficiently and effectively in long-term scenarios.

Method: Reformulate the problem as a temporal next-scale prediction task, using TensFormer for scalable temporal and spatial sequence modeling, combined with a holistic pose aggregation strategy to unify occupancy and ego-motion modeling.

Result: OccTENS delivers superior occupancy quality and faster inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: OccTENS provides a scalable, efficient, and controllable solution for long-term 3D occupancy generation through novel decomposition and pose handling strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to predict dense functional correspondences across image pairs by leveraging vision-language models and dense contrastive learning, improving performance in multi-view image settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of establishing dense correspondences across image pairs, especially in matching objects across different categories, by using object function knowledge to guide the process.

Method: A weakly-supervised learning framework leverages pseudo-labeling from vision-language models to identify functional parts and integrates dense contrastive learning for both functional and spatial knowledge extraction.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates advantages over existing solutions, validated through synthetic and real benchmark datasets, in predicting dense functional correspondences.

Conclusion: By integrating vision-language models and dense contrastive learning, the proposed method effectively establishes dense functional correspondences, outperforming baseline techniques.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: Improve few-shot learning capabilities in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP without overfitting or computationally expensive fine-tuning.

Method: Introduced Attn-Adapter with Memory Attn-Adapter (refines category embeddings) and Local-Global Attn-Adapter (integrates local and global features) for dynamic online adaptation using a few labeled examples.

Result: Attn-Adapter exhibits superior performance in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization while providing efficient inference and scalability across CLIP models.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter successfully tackles few-shot learning challenges, enabling better generalization and efficient scaling without retraining the base model.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliable defect detection in wind power plants, which requires high-resolution data and processing of multispectral imagery.

Method: The paper proposes an ensemble approach combining a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model, leveraging a bounding box fusion algorithm to integrate predictions from both models.

Result: The ensemble model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming the standalone YOLOv8’s mAP@.5 of 0.91.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble model demonstrates that fusing multispectral data and YOLO architectures enhances defect detection accuracy, offering a more reliable solution for wind power plant monitoring.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Method: SPECS modifies the CLIP model to emphasize specificity by rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones in image captioning evaluations.

Result: SPECS achieves comparable performance to LLM-based metrics in human judgment correlation while being significantly more efficient.

Conclusion: SPECS provides a practical and efficient alternative to costly LLM-based metrics for iterative evaluation in image captioning model development.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Conclusion: Generative models like ChexGen improve data efficiency, fairness, and performance in medical AI systems, showing transformative potential for the field.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for multiview video compression that significantly outperforms the MV-HEVC standard in compression efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the storage and transmission challenges posed by the large data volume of multiview videos, which are essential for immersive 3D scene reconstruction.

Method: The authors propose an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework which uses feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction and a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module to exploit motion and content correlations between views.

Result: The LMVC framework shows a significant improvement in compression efficiency compared to the traditional MV-HEVC standard, achieving better results while maintaining random access and backward compatibility.

Conclusion: The proposed LMVC framework establishes a strong baseline for future research in multiview video coding, addressing the challenges of storage and transmission while enhancing compression performance.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for accurate 3D reconstruction of tubular anatomical structures, addressing limitations in topology correction of existing methods with improvements in geometry and topology metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing methods for 3D tubular structure reconstruction, which fail to ensure global topological correctness and geometric accuracy, impacting applications like bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial assessments.

Method: TopoSculpt introduces a holistic framework with a whole-region modeling strategy, a Topological Integrity Betti constraint ensuring Betti number priors and global integrity, and a curriculum refinement scheme utilizing persistent homology for progressive error correction.

Result: Experiments on pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets showed significant reductions in topological errors (e.g., β0 errors reduced) and marked improvements in branch detection and geometry metrics by approximately 10%.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively enhances the high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomical structures, addressing global topological correctness and advancing medical imaging accuracy.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep-learning model for pneumothorax detection using a U-Net with EfficientNet-B4 encoder, achieving strong segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumothorax is life-threatening and challenging to detect on chest X-rays, especially in subtle cases, necessitating better automated tools.

Method: A U-Net with EfficientNet-B4 encoder was developed, trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation, and used a hybrid loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Dice loss.

Result: The model demonstrated an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.7008 and a Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset.

Conclusion: The deep-learning pipeline can accurately localize pneumothorax regions and serves as a significant aid for radiologists.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

### [122] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve OOD detection by generating accurate negative labels and balancing detection for near-OOD and far-OOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods struggle with accurately constructing negative spaces and suffer from false negatives, particularly in near-OOD scenarios. Enhancing OOD detection remains a critical challenge.

Method: ANTS utilizes MLLMs to generate descriptive negative sentences from negative images, improves near-OOD detection by tailoring negative labels to visually similar subsets, and balances detection tasks with an adaptive weighted scoring system.

Result: On the ImageNet benchmark, the proposed method significantly improves performance, reducing FPR95 by 4.2% and establishing state-of-the-art results in OOD detection.

Conclusion: ANTS enhances OOD detection by addressing key challenges with a training-free and zero-shot framework, offering high scalability and adaptability across various open-environment tasks.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMChange, a method for multimodal remote sensing change detection (RSCD) that combines image and text modalities for improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RSCD methods primarily rely on image modalities, which limits their ability to generalize and effectively represent features under illumination and noise disturbances.

Method: MMChange integrates image and text modalities using modules like Image Feature Refinement (IFR), Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE), and Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) for improved multimodal analysis.

Result: MMChange outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments conducted on benchmark datasets like LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach enhances RSCD by leveraging textual and visual data for better feature representation and change detection, proving its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL), a method for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, achieving state-of-the-art results with efficient processing and better spatial encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve WSI classification by addressing issues like sequence length extrapolation and spatial relationships in current methods.

Method: SAC-MIL integrates a positional encoding module for spatial relationships and a SAC block (MLP-based) for instance correlations, ensuring computational efficiency.

Result: SAC-MIL outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL offers an efficient and effective solution for WSI classification, with better handling of spatial data and simpler deployment compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Daniel Sobotka,Alexander Herold,Matthias Perkonigg,Lucian Beer,Nina Bastati,Alina Sablatnig,Ahmed Ba-Ssalamah,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to segment liver vessels in MRI data without contrast by leveraging auxiliary contrast-enhanced MRI during training, showing improved accuracy even with minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation in non-contrast MRI is challenging and clinically valuable for analyzing vascular remodeling in liver diseases. Current solutions rely on contrast-enhanced imaging, which is not always available.

Method: A multi-task learning framework is developed to use auxiliary contrast-enhanced MRI data (available only during training) paired with native MRI data to improve vessel segmentation without requiring extensive annotations.

Result: The approach significantly improves vessel segmentation accuracy, particularly when training data is limited. It generalizes well, as shown by experiments in brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: Auxiliary imaging modalities, even when available only during training, can effectively enhance model performance across domains by reducing reliance on expert annotations.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores prompt sensitivity in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and introduces the framework 'Promptception' for systematic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt phrasing significantly impacts the accuracy of LMMs in MCQA tasks, making evaluation inconsistent and challenging.

Method: The authors developed 'Promptception,' a framework with 61 prompt types covering various categories to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs across three MCQA benchmarks.

Result: Findings reveal that proprietary LMMs are more sensitive to prompt phrasing, whereas open-source models are steadier but struggle with complex prompts.

Conclusion: The authors proposed tailored prompting principles for proprietary and open-source LMMs to ensure more consistent and fair evaluations.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework (SliceSemOcc) for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that leverages vertical slices and adaptive attention mechanisms to address limitations in modeling height-wise information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by addressing the limitations of existing methods, such as neglecting height-axis information and inefficient attention mechanisms that restrict resolution along the vertical axis.

Method: The proposed method, SliceSemOcc, employs vertical slice-based voxel feature extraction (global and local components), a global-local fusion module for better spatial and contextual integration, and a SEAttention3D module for dynamic height-wise attention.

Result: SliceSemOcc achieves significant performance improvements in mean IoU, especially for small-object categories, based on evaluations on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the importance of vertical-slice-based techniques and dynamic attention for height-aware 3D scene modeling, offering a notable advancement in accuracy and reliability for 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting spurious correlations in vision transformers using a novel method, validated on large-scale ImageNet experiments and real-world applications like breast mass classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of spurious correlations in neural network-based computer vision models that can undermine model reliability and generalizability.

Method: The authors developed a novel method for detecting spurious correlations in vision transformers, leveraging both supervised and self-supervised training approaches.

Result: The method successfully identified spurious correlations in the ImageNet dataset, highlighting the impact of training methodologies on these patterns and specific dataset artifacts.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of addressing spurious correlations for trustworthy AI and provides datasets, insights, and a real-world case study to guide future work.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diverse real-world applications like pathology image segmentation and sentiment analysis, where majority class labels can efficiently guide instance classification.

Method: The authors propose a Counting Network to determine majority labels by counting class instances, and an MPEM to enhance learning by removing minority instances.

Result: The approach outperformed traditional MIL methods across four datasets. Ablation studies validated the contribution of each module.

Conclusion: The proposed LML framework and methods offer a significant advancement in multi-class MIL problems, demonstrating strong practical and experimental results.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Motivation: Traditional video surveillance systems fail to meet real-time requirements in complex environments due to delays caused by inefficiencies in automatic recognition algorithms and computing architectures.

Method: The study developed a heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon accelerator cards. It also integrated a lightweight YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm for UAV monitoring.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated a processing delay of 50-100 ms for 1920*1080 video streams and achieved a multi-scale target recognition accuracy exceeding 98.5%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully reduces processing delays and improves precision in UAV tracking, offering a valuable application for domestic chip technology in surveillance systems.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video

Method: The proposed method aggregates multi-view features using a K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) algorithm. This involves selecting K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner and exploring weight strategies for effective aggregation.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Market1501, MSMT17, and Occluded-DukeMTMC demonstrate significant improvements: 9.8%/22.0% increase in Rank@1, and enhanced mAP scores, along with improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces view bias using multi-view features, boosts retrieval accuracy, requires no model fine-tuning or extra annotations, and is efficient for handling large-scale datasets.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

*Yaru Chen,Faegheh Sardari,Peiliang Zhang,Ruohao Guo,Yang Xiang,Zhenbo Li,Wenwu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved method for the Audio-Visual Video Parsing task by combining Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) modules to mitigate noise amplification and improve temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issues of error amplification caused by treating noisy pseudo labels as reliable data or indiscriminate attention spread in current methods for Audio-Visual Video Parsing.

Method: Introduce the BiT module for semantic injection and dynamic calibration of audio-visual features and the CATS module for semantic propagation and precise semantic dissemination over time.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple key indicators across the LLP and UnAV-100 benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: By integrating strengths from previous research, the method overcomes initial pseudo-label errors and enhances semantic modeling, significantly advancing AVVP task performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Motivation: ADAS requires efficient, real-time perception models to ensure safety and effectiveness. Current solutions often struggle to balance computational cost and performance.

Method: The TriLiteNet model leverages a lightweight architecture optimized for multi-task driving perception, focusing on low parameter count and minimal GFLOPs.

Conclusion: TriLiteNet offers a scalable, efficient solution for ADAS applications, combining competitive task performance with low computational demand, making it deployable on embedded devices.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the advantages of event cameras, such as low latency and motion robustness, for pedestrian safety and intention prediction, especially in variable natural and adverse environmental conditions.

Method: DVS-PedX combines synthetic data from CARLA simulator and real-world JAAD video-to-event data, providing labeled RGB frames, DVS frames, and spiking neural network baselines to facilitate research.

Result: Baseline experiments reveal a sim-to-real gap in data and showcase the potential challenges in domain adaptation and multimodal fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

### [135] [TaleDiffusion: Multi-Character Story Generation with Dialogue Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04123)
*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion is a framework for creating consistent and accurate multi-character story visualizations using iterative processing, character consistency, and improved dialogue rendering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of inconsistent character representation and inaccurate dialogue rendering in text-to-story visualization, which disrupts storytelling coherency.

Method: TaleDiffusion employs a pre-trained LLM to generate story elements, followed by a bounded attention mask for controlling character interactions, identity-consistent self-attention for maintaining character consistency, and region-aware attention for precise object placement. Dialogue rendering uses CLIPSeg for accurate bubble assignment.

Result: Experiments show that TaleDiffusion excels in character consistency, minimal artifacts, precise dialogue placement, and storytelling compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion is a significant improvement over current approaches, offering a robust solution for creating cohesive and artifact-free multi-character visual narratives.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEPG, a framework integrating spatial-semantic models and large language models for generating complex text-to-image results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle with complex prompts and lack stylistic diversity.

Method: The MEPG framework consists of two components: (1) a PSA module using supervised fine-tuned LLMs to establish spatial and style semantics, and (2) a MED module leveraging dynamic expert routing for cross-region image generation.

Result: Experiments show MEPG improves image quality and style diversity significantly compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: MEPG effectively addresses limitations in text-to-image generation, providing a scalable solution for complex layouts and diverse styles.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

*Orlando Castaneda,Kevin So-Tang,Kshitij Gurung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits an existing deepfake detection method and shows that tuning hyperparameters can greatly boost its accuracy, achieving competitive performance compared to commercial detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to validate and improve upon existing methods for deepfake detection on challenging real-world benchmarks, as deepfake technology continues to proliferate.

Method: The paper revisits a baseline approach by Ojha et al., leveraging pretrained vision backbones and fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance its generalizability and performance on 'in-the-wild' benchmarks.

Result: By fine-tuning hyperparameters, the adapted model achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, an 18% improvement over its previously reported performance and close to commercial deepfake detectors.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of simple methodological tweaks to rival commercial solutions in deepfake detection, while discussing practical considerations like computational costs and real-world deployment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisioFirm, an AI-assisted web tool that automates and simplifies image labeling, significantly reducing manual annotation efforts while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation for AI models is a laborious task, limiting scalability for large datasets, necessitating better tools to ease human effort and improve efficiency.

Method: The study proposed VisioFirm, a web application integrating foundation models like CLIP and Grounding DINO, with features like low-confidence thresholding, model pre-caching, and interactive tools for editing annotations. It employs AI-based prediction and filtering for annotation tasks.

Result: VisioFirm reduced manual annotation workload by up to 90% while maintaining high accuracy through benchmarks on various datasets.

Conclusion: VisioFirm provides a hybrid approach to scalable image annotation with effective AI-driven automation and accessible offline usability, potentially revolutionizing annotation workflows.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

*Ruohong Yang,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUDE, a method for unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) that disentangles object features from domain-specific styles to improve semantic image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UCIR methods face challenges with domain gaps because object features crucial for retrieval are entangled with domain-specific styles, making retrieval inefficient.

Method: DUDE utilizes a text-to-image generative model to isolate object features from domain-specific styles and aligns mutual neighbors progressively across and within domains for better feature alignment.

Result: DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets across 13 domains, showcasing its effectiveness in cross-domain retrieval.

Conclusion: Feature disentanglement with DUDE is a promising approach to improving UCIR by addressing domain gaps, and experimental results validate the method's superiority. Its code will be made available to the public.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LASER, a framework that enhances Vision Language Models (VLMs) for better visual reasoning and GUI grounding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is enabling Vision Language Models to reason effectively over specific image regions, especially for high-resolution inputs and multi-element visual interactions.

Method: The proposed method, LASER, integrates Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region evaluation to guide models to relevant image regions while adapting reasoning steps based on complexity.

Result: LASER demonstrates consistent performance enhancements in benchmarks like ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 and achieves a state-of-the-art score of 55.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro, outperforming other 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: The study validates LASER as a successful approach to improve interaction with high-resolution GUI, optimizing reasoning capabilities in Vision Language Models.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

*David Huangal,J. Alex Hurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating differential morphological profiles (DMP) into semantic segmentation networks to address challenges in remote sensing imagery, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid DMP architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve semantic segmentation for overhead remote sensing imagery by addressing unique challenges such as extreme scale variation, imbalance issues, and large image sizes.

Method: Integrate DMP features into state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer segmentation networks through direct input and hybrid architecture approaches, and evaluate using the iSAID dataset.

Result: Hybrid DMP architectures outperform direct-input variants and surpass non-DMP models in metrics like mIoU, F1 score, and Recall.

Conclusion: Incorporating DMP features, particularly through hybrid architectures, enhances semantic segmentation performance for remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method to synthesize 3D tau PET images using a text-guided 3D diffusion model, leveraging structural MRI and plasma biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high cost and limited availability of tau PET for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease by leveraging non-invasive and accessible alternatives like MRI and plasma biomarkers.

Method: A text-guided 3D diffusion model was used for synthetic tau PET image generation, integrating textual prompts (plasma p-tau217 measurements) and structural MRI constraints.

Result: The model produced realistic 3D tau PET images across various Alzheimer's disease stages, demonstrating clinical relevance and utility in simulating disease progression.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel, cost-effective, non-invasive tool for tau pathology analysis and disease modeling, benefiting diagnostic and research applications.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

*Junying Meng,Gangxuan Zhou,Jun Liu,Weihong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that incorporates spatial regularization methods and volume priors to enhance segmentation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in feature extraction and the use of prior information in existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation networks.

Method: The framework integrates explicit volume priors at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization into a segmentation network. It incorporates an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint through a regression network and a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function to match volume distributions between labeled and unlabeled datasets.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated superior performance in experimental evaluations on the 2017 ACDC, PROMISE12, and thigh muscle MR image datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit volume priors and spatial regularization methods improves segmentation results and addresses challenges in utilizing unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

*Jianning Deng,Kartic Subr,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for learning 3D representations of articulated objects using minimal views and without camera pose supervision, leveraging self-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods relying heavily on dense views and ground-truth camera poses for reconstructing articulated objects, and achieve this goal with weaker input assumptions.

Method: The approach reconstructs each articulation using sparse-view 3D techniques, learns a deformation field for dense pose correspondences, disentangles static/moving parts for cleaner motion data, and optimizes geometry/appearance/kinematics using self-supervised consistency loss.

Result: The method achieves accurate and detailed representations of articulated objects even with sparse-view, unposed images, and compares favorably on benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: This novel framework demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing articulated objects using significantly weaker input assumptions while maintaining high accuracy and detail in the representations.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic noise, caused by mislabeled images due to visual similarity in datasets, poses challenges to traditional supervised learning methods.

Method: The method uses synthetic images with reliable labels as reference points to correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets, improving classification accuracy. It can operate in conjunction with existing noise-robust learning techniques.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements were achieved: 30% on CIFAR-10, 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise.

Conclusion: Synthetic images, despite domain gaps, offer a promising strategy to enhance classification accuracy in noisy datasets when combined with noise-robust learning.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

*Silvio Chito,Paolo Rabino,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a DINO-based model for efficient odd-one-out anomaly detection, achieving reduced parameters and training time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of the odd-one-out anomaly detection task in an efficient manner, acknowledging the need for spatial and relational reasoning.

Method: The method involves designing a DINO-based model with one-third fewer parameters and three times faster training compared to the state-of-the-art.

Result: The model maintains competitive anomaly detection performance while improving efficiency. A Multimodal Large Language Model baseline was also evaluated for insights into its limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed DINO-based model proves efficient and effective for anomaly detection, setting a foundation for further exploration in structured visual reasoning.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

### [147] [GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-language Models on WorldWide Image Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04334)
*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoArena, an open platform for evaluating global image geolocalization systems, addressing data leakage and existing metric limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geolocalization evaluation methods face challenges such as data leakage from pretrained models and reliance on exact geographic metrics that may overlook reasoning processes and compromise privacy.

Method: GeoArena uses in-the-wild image uploads for diverse data evaluation and incorporates pairwise human judgments to benchmark LVLMs on geolocalization tasks.

Result: GeoArena has collected thousands of evaluations, enabling a comprehensive leaderboard of LVLMs on the geolocalization task and providing insights into model performance.

Conclusion: GeoArena offers significant advancements in fair and human-centered geolocalization model evaluation, prioritizing diversity and usability.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

### [148] [From Editor to Dense Geometry Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04338)
*JiYuan Wang,Chunyu Lin,Lei Sun,Rongying Liu,Lang Nie,Mingxing Li,Kang Liao,Xiangxiang Chu,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of image editing models for dense geometry estimation, introducing a new framework, FE2E, based on Diffusion Transformer architecture which achieves superior results compared to generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to determine whether image editing models, due to their inherent structural priors, can surpass pre-trained text-to-image generative models in dense prediction tasks like geometry estimation.

Method: The authors systematically analyzed fine-tuning behaviors of editing versus generative models and introduced FE2E, leveraging the Diffusion Transformer editor with a redefined training objective, logarithmic quantization, and global attention for joint depth and normal estimation.

Result: FE2E delivers substantial performance improvements, including over 35% gains on the ETH3D dataset, outperforming models that use 100 times more training data.

Conclusion: Image editing models are more effective for dense prediction tasks when properly adapted, as demonstrated by the FE2E framework, which showcases state-of-the-art performance without requiring vast training datasets.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Zhen Lin,Xinlong Rao,Anyang Tong,Shiyao Li,Fei Wang,Changlin Chen,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework (MICACL) to improve dynamic facial expression recognition by addressing challenges like spatio-temporal modeling and long-tailed data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle challenges in DFER, such as model induction bias caused by complex spatio-temporal dependencies and imbalanced data distributions.

Method: The paper proposes MICACL framework, comprising GEIIM for spatio-temporal feature relationships, WIAN for weighted feature aggregation, and MCCL for long-tailed category balancing.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets (DFEW, FERV39k) show MICACL outperforms existing methods with higher accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: MICACL represents a significant advancement in DFER by optimizing both spatial-temporal dependency modeling and the handling of long-tailed distributions, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

*Dor Cohen,Inga Efrosman,Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to create panoramic summaries from body-camera footage for quicker situational awareness and efficient decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to quickly review and interpret body-camera footage for situational awareness and decision-making in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The pipeline uses monocular SLAM to map the camera trajectory and environment layout, clusters viewpoints along the trajectory to identify representative frames, and stitches these into panoramic images.

Result: The produced panoramas offer concise and spatially coherent visual summaries of incident scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances the ability to rapidly understand and review complex incident environments using body-camera footage.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

### [151] [AnomalyLMM: Bridging Generative Knowledge and Discriminative Retrieval for Text-Based Person Anomaly Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04376)
*Hao Ju,Hu Zhang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnomalyLMM, a framework utilizing Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) for text-based person anomaly search, achieving improved performance on the PAB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to address public safety by enabling fine-grained text-based person anomaly search, tackling challenges like cross-modal alignment and sparse anomaly recognition in real-world samples.

Method: The authors propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline with masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking for anomaly detection, leveraging LMMs in a training-free adaptation approach.

Result: AnomalyLMM outperforms the baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 on the PAB dataset and exhibits interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of deploying LMMs for text-based anomaly search, providing a framework and qualitative insights, while paving the way for future research.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

*Yilin Tao,Jiashui Huang,Huaze Xu,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASE-MLLM, a framework incorporating image aesthetic saliency into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for aesthetic image captioning (AIC), achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIC methods leveraging MLLMs mainly focus on fine-tuning and fail to adapt or emphasize aesthetic-specific content, limiting their effectiveness in AIC tasks.

Method: The researchers developed ASE-MLLM, a framework that incorporates an Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract features of aesthetic saliency. These features are fused with original image features using a cross-attention mechanism in a new encoder named IAS-ViT.

Result: ASE-MLLM showed significant improvement and outperformed traditional methods and other MLLMs in AIC tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on current AIC benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating aesthetic saliency into MLLMs using ASE-MLLM presents a more effective method for aesthetic image captioning, demonstrating the utility and importance of domain-specific adaptations in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

### [153] [SSGaussian: Semantic-Aware and Structure-Preserving 3D Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04379)
*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a 3D style transfer pipeline that uses pretrained 2D diffusion models for improved artistic expression and instance-level consistency in 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle with extracting high-level style semantics and maintaining structural clarity in 3D representations.

Method: The proposed method leverages 2D diffusion models in two stages: stylizing key viewpoint renderings via diffusion priors and transferring the results onto 3D representations using cross-view style alignment and instance-level style transfer mechanisms.

Result: The proposed pipeline demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, achieving better style fidelity, structure, and artistic coherence across diverse 3D scenes.

Conclusion: This novel pipeline effectively integrates 2D diffusion priors into 3D style transfer, resolving existing challenges and elevating stylization quality in 3D environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

*Tingyou Li,Zixin Xu,Zirui Gao,Hanfei Yan,Xiaojing Huang,Jizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework for nanoscale imaging that simultaneously reconstructs the object and probe, yielding high-quality images even under low-signal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in conventional and deep learning methods for reconstructing nanoscale images in x-ray ptychography, particularly under low-signal conditions, which hampers technique fidelity and wider adoption.

Method: The method involves using a self-supervised framework called PtyINR to parameterize both the object and illuminating probe as continuous neural representations for end-to-end reconstruction from raw diffraction data.

Result: PtyINR demonstrates superior reconstruction performance in both simulated and experimental datasets, effectively handling noisy, low-signal scenarios and achieving better image quality than traditional approaches.

Conclusion: PtyINR not only improves reconstruction fidelity in x-ray ptychography but also offers a robust, physics-informed framework generalizable to other computational microscopy problems.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative approach to creating real-world multimodal safety (RMS) datasets using an image-oriented self-adaptive method, producing 35k image-text pairs and introducing a standardized evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk-oriented dataset construction methods are insufficient to handle the growing complexity of safety challenges in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and the lack of a unified evaluation metric limits the validation of their effectiveness.

Method: The researchers developed an image-oriented self-adaptive pipeline starting with images to construct paired text and guidance responses. A safety judge model was fine-tuned for standardized evaluation.

Result: The study generated an RMS dataset with 35k image-text pairs and guidance responses, proving scalability and effectiveness across various tasks and demonstrating the approach's capabilities through a safety judge model.

Conclusion: The image-oriented approach proves successful in constructing comprehensive RMS datasets and sets a benchmark for evaluating multimodal safety challenges in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MDT-dist, a framework for reducing the sampling steps in 3D flow generation tasks from dozens to one or two, achieving faster inference while maintaining high-quality output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of slow inference in flow-based 3D generation models and explore distillation methods like Consistency Models (CMs), which are under-studied in 3D tasks.

Method: The paper proposes MDT-dist, with two objectives—Velocity Matching (VM) for matching velocity fields and Velocity Distillation (VD) for density distillation—employed to optimize the distillation process.

Result: The method reduces sampling steps from 25 to 1-2 in the TRELLIS framework, improving speed by 9.0x and 6.5x while maintaining high fidelity in visual and geometric aspects.

Conclusion: MDT-dist significantly accelerates few-step 3D generation and outperforms existing CM distillation methods, offering both efficiency and superior results.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

*Hyunsoo Cha,Byungjun Kim,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Durian, a zero-shot portrait animation method capable of transferring facial attributes between images using dual reference networks with a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-fidelity and spatially consistent method for transferring and animating portrait attributes across frames and in diverse real-world conditions.

Method: The method employs dual reference networks in a diffusion model, using spatial features from both portrait and attribute images. Training uses self-reconstruction with same-video frame pairs, and a mask expansion strategy addresses varying attribute sizes.

Result: Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance in portrait animation and attribute transfer, with support for multi-attribute composition without extra training.

Conclusion: Durian effectively generalizes to various attribute transfers and reference combinations, leveraging innovative training strategies and novel dual-reference architecture.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

*Benjamin El-Zein,Dominik Eckert,Andreas Fieselmann,Christopher Syben,Ludwig Ritschl,Steffen Kappler,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep learning approach to detect collimation shadows in X-ray images by leveraging prior knowledge of polygonal geometry, resulting in refined segmentation with robust accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the detection of collimator shadows in X-ray imaging, which is critical for reducing radiation dose and accurately preprocessing images despite challenges posed by scattered radiation obscuring edges.

Method: The study proposes a deep learning-based segmentation method using a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect polygonal collimation borders and combine it with region-of-interest (ROI) center extraction.

Result: The approach achieved robust reconstruction of collimated regions with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm across diverse X-ray test image sets.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective solution for generating line-constrained segmentation masks, proving flexibility in handling shadow borders without being restricted to a specific number of edges.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

### [159] [The Telephone Game: Evaluating Semantic Drift in Unified Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04438)
*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework called Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM) to evaluate consistency in Unified Models (UMs) across cross-modal tasks. The authors identify that current evaluation metrics for I2T and T2I operate in isolation and lack an understanding of semantic preservation over cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitation of existing single-pass evaluations for unified models, which fail to assess whether a model's understanding and generation capabilities maintain semantic consistency across image-to-text and text-to-image pairs.

Method: The UCF-UM framework evaluates cyclic consistency by analyzing semantic drift across multiple I2T and T2I cycles using three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), and Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG). A new benchmark, ND400, was developed to evaluate generalization beyond commonly used datasets like COCO.

Result: Applying UCF-UM to seven recent models showcased significant variations in cross-modal consistency, with some models like BAGEL maintaining stronger semantic coherence over cycles, while others like Vila-u showed faster semantic drift despite strong single-pass scores.

Conclusion: The study concludes that cyclic consistency is a critical component for evaluating unified models and presents UCF-UM as a complementary protocol to standard I2T and T2I evaluations for robust assessment of cross-modal stability and shared representations.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews advancements in omnidirectional image (ODI) research with a focus on adapting perspective-based techniques to panorama-specific challenges. It covers techniques, tasks, challenges, and future directions in panoramic vision technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for spatial intelligence and complete scene perception across sectors like virtual reality and autonomous driving, but ODIs differ greatly from standard perspective images, which complicates direct application of traditional methods.

Method: The paper surveys over 300 research works to categorize panoramic vision into four domains: visual quality, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation. A structured analysis of domain adaptation challenges and solutions is presented.

Result: 20+ representative tasks and solutions in panoramic vision are reviewed. Challenges such as geometric distortions, non-uniform sampling, and boundary periodicity are discussed alongside cross-method and cross-task comparisons.

Conclusion: The survey provides a comprehensive overview of panoramic vision research, emphasizing adaptation strategies and outlining challenges. It aims to inspire future studies and advancements in panoramic imaging technologies.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing application of text-to-image diffusion models in real-world creative domains highlights a gap in providing flexible image modifications while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across frames.

Method: The proposed method, Plot'n Polish, is a zero-shot framework that enables both consistent story generation and fine-grained, multi-level control over visual story details.

Result: Plot'n Polish allows creators to achieve enhanced control and consistent imagery across story frames, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish addresses challenges in story visualization by making image refinement and narrative consistency more accessible, allowing for seamless creative workflows.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

*Zehong Yan,Peng Qi,Wynne Hsu,Mong Li Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TRUST-VL, a multimodal misinformation detection model leveraging joint training and novel mechanisms to tackle unseen textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the rise of multimodal misinformation enhanced by generative AI and overcoming the limitations of single-task-focused methods in generalizing to unseen distortion types.

Method: Development of TRUST-VL, a vision-language model with a Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module and training it using TRUST-Instruct, a dataset designed to align with human fact-checking reasoning for multimodal misinformation detection.

Result: TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalizability across in-domain and zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Joint training across multimodal distortions and a structured reasoning-based approach can enhance misinformation detection accuracy and interpretability, offering a solution scalable to diverse and unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VFR, a generative model for creating seamless, minute-scale virtual try-on videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of generating long virtual try-on videos that are both smooth locally and consistent globally, without requiring extensive computational resources or long input videos.

Method: The VFR framework uses an auto-regressive segment-by-segment generation process, incorporating a prefix video condition for smoothness and an anchor video for global temporal consistency.

Result: VFR successfully generates high-quality virtual try-on videos of arbitrary length, maintaining both local and global consistency under diverse motion scenarios.

Conclusion: The work is a pioneering step in the generation of long virtual try-on videos, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods in overcoming key challenges.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

*Siddharth Samsi,Dan Campbell,Emanuel Scoullos,Oded Green*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents an alternative approach to implementing the HPEC Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge using NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem, achieving significant speedups compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize computational workloads in HPC systems for tasks requiring complex graph analysis, moving beyond traditional benchmarks like LINPACK.

Method: The paper uses GraphBLAS formulations interpreted via data science concepts and implements the benchmark problem using NVIDIA’s RAPIDS ecosystem with tools like cuDF and cupy.

Result: The implementation achieves substantial acceleration, with speedups ranging from 147x to 2185x across different NVIDIA GPUs compared to CPU-based approaches using Pandas.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that off-the-shelf software and GPUs can efficiently handle complex HPC graph workloads, substantially improving performance without the need for specialized HPC code.

Abstract: The HPEC Graph Challenge is a collection of benchmarks representing complex
workloads that test the hardware and software components of HPC systems, which
traditional benchmarks, such as LINPACK, do not. The first benchmark, Subgraph
Isomorphism, focused on several compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. The
most recent of the challenges, the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,
represents a shift in direction, as it represents a longer end-to-end workload
that requires many more software components, including, but not limited to,
data I/O, data structures for representing graph data, and a wide range of
functions for data preparation and network analysis. A notable feature of this
new graph challenge is the use of GraphBLAS to represent the computational
aspects of the problem statement. In this paper, we show an alternative
interpretation of the GraphBLAS formulations using the language of data
science. With this formulation, we show that the new graph challenge can be
implemented using off-the-shelf ETL tools available in open-source, enterprise
software such as NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem. Using off-the-shelf software,
RAPIDS cuDF and cupy, we enable significant software acceleration without
requiring any specific HPC code and show speedups, over the same code running
with Pandas on the CPU, of 147x-509x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, 243x-1269X for an
NVIDIA H100 GPU, and 332X-2185X for an NVIDIA H200 GPU.

*John Augustine,Soumyottam Chatterjee,Valerie King,Manish Kumar,Shachar Meir,David Peleg*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper studies the Download problem in distributed systems where peers retrieve data stored externally. It focuses on designing efficient protocols for asynchronous networks under two fault models: crash and Byzantine failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to minimize query complexity for nonfaulty peers while ensuring resilience against a fraction of peer failures in distributed data retrieval systems.

Method: The authors extend the Study of distributed data retrieval to asynchronous networks, proposing deterministic solutions for crash faults and analyzing query complexity for both deterministic and randomized protocols under Byzantine faults.

Result: The study establishes lower bounds for randomized protocols in asynchronous networks with high Byzantine faults and devises near-optimal randomized protocols for cases with fewer Byzantine faults.

Conclusion: This research is the first to address the asynchronous Download problem, providing foundational insights into designing efficient and resilient data retrieval protocols.

Abstract: The distributedData Retrieval (DR) model consists of $k$ peers connected by a
complete peer-to-peer communication network, and a trusted external data source
that stores an array $\textbf{X}$ of $n$ bits ($n \gg k$). Up to $\beta k$ of
the peers might fail in any execution (for $\beta \in [0, 1)$). Peers can
obtain the information either by inexpensive messages passed among themselves
or through expensive queries to the source array $\textbf{X}$. In the DR model,
we focus on designing protocols that minimize the number of queries performed
by any nonfaulty peer (a measure referred to as query complexity) while
maximizing the resilience parameter $\beta$.
  The Download problem requires each nonfaulty peer to correctly learn the
entire array $\textbf{X}$. Earlier work on this problem focused on synchronous
communication networks and established several deterministic and randomized
upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to extend the study of
distributed data retrieval to asynchronous communication networks. We address
the Download problem under both the Byzantine and crash failure models. We
present query-optimal deterministic solutions in an asynchronous model that can
tolerate any fixed fraction $\beta<1$ of crash faults. In the Byzantine failure
model, it is known that deterministic protocols incur a query complexity of
$\Omega(n)$ per peer, even under synchrony. We extend this lower bound to
randomized protocols in the asynchronous model for $\beta \geq 1/2$, and
further show that for $\beta < 1/2$, a randomized protocol exists with
near-optimal query complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to address the Download problem in asynchronous communication networks.

*Avisek Sharma,Satakshi Ghosh,Buddhadeb Sau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an algorithm to solve the gathering problem for autonomous robots with limited visibility ($\pi$-visibility) and non-rigid movement under a fully asynchronous scheduler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robotic gathering in the $\pi$-visibility model, especially under non-rigid movement and a fully asynchronous scheduler, which has proven difficult in previous studies.

Method: The proposed algorithm employs robots with finite communication abilities ($\mathcal{FCOM}$), overcoming challenges posed by $\pi$-visibility and asynchronous operation.

Result: The research provides a solution for the gathering problem, extending feasibility in the case of non-rigid movement and $\mathcal{FCOM}$ capabilities under asynchronous operations.

Conclusion: This work extends the feasibility of robotic gathering in challenging scenarios, demonstrating that $\pi$-visibility gathering is possible with finite communication and non-rigid movement under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

Abstract: This work addresses the gathering problem for a set of autonomous, anonymous,
and homogeneous robots with limited visibility operating in a continuous
circle. The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a
rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise
direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots
on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna
\textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is
impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$
visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$
visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is
removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a
gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory
($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.
  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be
done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous
scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one
point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots
had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite
communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$). In this work the robot movement is
non-rigid and the robots work under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the computational inefficiencies in simulating what-if scenarios for systems influenced by burnout variables, such as online advertising with campaign budgets.

Method: The authors propose a novel algorithmic framework called uncertainty relaxation to enable efficient parallel computation for counterfactual analysis in systems with burnout variables.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves scalability for estimating counterfactuals in systems where burnout variables are present.

Conclusion: The study offers a practical, scalable solution to compute counterfactuals in complex systems, addressing limitations posed by burnout variables and enhancing the feasibility of large-scale simulations.

Abstract: We consider large-scale systems influenced by burnout variables - state
variables that start active, shape dynamics, and irreversibly deactivate once
certain conditions are met. Simulating what-if scenarios in such systems is
computationally demanding, as alternative trajectories often require sequential
processing, which does not scale very well. This challenge arises in settings
like online advertising, because of campaigns budgets, complicating
counterfactual analysis despite rich data availability. We introduce a new type
of algorithms based on what we refer to as uncertainty relaxation, that enables
efficient parallel computation, significantly improving scalability for
counterfactual estimation in systems with burnout variables.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LowDiff, a framework to optimize frequent checkpointing in distributed training, addressing cost and performance issues using compressed gradients and dynamic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Checkpointing is crucial for recovering from failures during large-scale distributed training but incurs high costs when done frequently, leading to degraded performance.

Method: LowDiff reuses compressed gradients for differential checkpointing, incorporates batched gradient write optimization, dynamically tunes checkpoint frequency and batching size, enhances layer-specific gradient reuse, and utilizes CPU-based asynchronous persistence strategies.

Result: Experiments showed LowDiff can achieve checkpointing per iteration with an overhead of less than 3.1% runtime, demonstrating its efficiency across various workloads.

Conclusion: LowDiff enables efficient frequent checkpointing, addressing cost and overhead challenges in distributed training without compromising system performance.

Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures,
so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies
focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it
generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading
training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to
reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application
to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework
that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints
to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write
optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also
dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to
maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient
reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence
strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression.
Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing
frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\% runtime overhead.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper revisits the OBLOT model in swarm robotics, presenting a resolution algorithm for synchronous robots on finite graphs, leveraging computational power to achieve task efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores how computational power impacts the performance of algorithms in the OBLOT model, which traditionally lacks focus on this aspect.

Method: The authors leverage the unlimited computational power of synchronous robots to design an algorithm that optimizes task completion in terms of moves and rounds.

Result: They demonstrate that computational power significantly affects algorithm performance, and their proposed algorithm resolves a wide class of problems with minimal resource use.

Conclusion: Computational power is vital for efficient algorithm design in the OBLOT robotics model, enabling optimized performance in terms of rounds and moves.

Abstract: The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics.
It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are
anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their
only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,
i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of
distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous
research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished
within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed
computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is
neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the
number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove
that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited
computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,
by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to
a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and
rounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel optimizers for neural networks, utilizing the Riemannian metric from loss landscape visualization, showing effectiveness in low dimensions and slight improvements over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimizers for neural networks face challenges in balancing efficient learning rates and handling high curvature regions in the loss landscape.

Method: The authors use the Riemannian metric from the loss landscape's geometric perspective to derive new optimizers and evaluate them against existing methods like SGD and Adam.

Result: The proposed optimizers perform well in low-dimensional tasks and show slight improvements over state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting theoretically beneficial properties.

Conclusion: These optimizers automatically adjust learning rates in high curvature areas and can integrate into existing preconditioning methods with computational efficiency comparable to Adam.

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT is a general-purpose AI foundation model designed for analyzing electronic health records by supporting feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current AI models for electronic health records, which are primarily single-purpose and lack generalizability in diverse real-world healthcare scenarios.

Method: CEHR-GPT incorporates a novel time-token-based learning framework to encode patient timelines effectively, enabling temporal reasoning in EHR analysis.

Result: CEHR-GPT demonstrated robust performance across feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation tasks, and effectively generalized to external datasets via vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT’s versatility provides a significant step forward in EHR analysis, enabling rapid model deployment, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without retraining for specific tasks.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

*E. Khalafyan,A. E. Allahverdyan,A. Hovhannisyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of the Common Cause (PCC). It utilizes this relationship to improve rank estimation and robustness in NMF and proposes applications in clustering and data denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to explore the connection between NMF and PCC and evaluate how their reciprocal relationship can address challenges, like nonidentifiability and noise sensitivity, in NMF implementations.

Method: The authors map gray-scale image datasets into probabilistic models and analyze how PCC can stabilize rank estimation in NMF. They also utilize NMF as a tool to test an approximate implementation of PCC, resulting in clustering and denoising applications.

Result: The paper demonstrates that PCC-based rank estimation for NMF is stable against weak noise. Moreover, the resulting NMF implementation resolves nonidentifiability issues and produces robust features. The paper also introduces an NMF-based clustering method and denoising technique.

Conclusion: The relationship between NMF and PCC provides insights that improve NMF's robustness to noise and nonidentifiability while offering additional functionalities like clustering and data denoising.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometry-aware deep learning framework to enhance adversarial robustness and balance training accuracy by sculpting the internal representations of neural networks for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing training accuracy and adversarial robustness has been a challenge in deep learning, necessitating the development of methods to address this tradeoff.

Method: A geometry-aware deep learning framework is proposed that employs layer-wise local training to create smooth and robust internal feature representations, defending against white and black box adversarial attacks.

Result: The approach results in improved manifold smoothness, stronger adversarial robustness, and the ability to integrate new information without disrupting existing knowledge structures.

Conclusion: The geometry-aware framework provides a pathway to align biological and artificial intelligence while enhancing robustness and adaptability in deep learning systems.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

*Yunkai Bao,Reza Safarzadeh,Xin Wang,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedDeCAB, a semi-decentralized client selection method for Federated Learning (FL), which addresses client availability and data heterogeneity while reducing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in Federated Learning (FL) caused by client availability issues, limited energy resources, and data heterogeneity in Internet of Things (IoT) environments.

Method: The authors propose FedDeCAB, a novel method that selects clients probabilistically and allows offline clients to exchange partial model parameters with nearby clients for joint optimization.

Result: Experiments using taxi and vessel trajectory datasets demonstrate that FedDeCAB performs well under heterogeneous data distributions, limited communication budgets, and the dynamic availability of clients.

Conclusion: FedDeCAB is a promising solution for improving FL performance in scenarios with constrained resources and dynamic client availability, as it enhances model convergence and reduces communication overhead.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SharedRep-RLHF, a new framework for reinforcement learning from human feedback that addresses the limitations of previous methods and achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-reward RLHF fails to account for diverse opinions across sub-populations, introducing bias towards dominant groups. MaxMin-RLHF attempts fairness by focusing on the group with minimum reward but struggles with minority group performance.

Method: SharedRep-RLHF focuses on learning shared traits in annotations across groups rather than separate reward models. It quantifies sample complexity and demonstrates the suboptimality of existing models in capturing shared traits.

Result: Experiments reveal a performance gain of up to 20% in win rate for SharedRep-RLHF across diverse natural language tasks when compared to MaxMin-RLHF.

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF effectively addresses fairness and minority group performance issues, outperforming existing methods by leveraging shared annotations and characteristics.

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address efficiency loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission issues in supply chains through advanced modeling and machine learning.

Method: A data-driven framework combining diverse economic theories with machine learning techniques like LSTM, XGBoost, random forests, and reinforcement learning, applied to real-world supply chain enterprises.

Result: 30% increase in inventory turnover, 18%-22% reduction in SME financing costs, >95% order fulfillment rate, and robust model performances such as ≤8% error in demand forecasting and ≥90% credit assessment accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly enhances supply chain efficiency, reduces financing burdens, and ensures sustainable development, validated through real-world applications.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Result: Their method stabilizes optimization, maintains or improves accuracy on challenging benchmarks like CIFAR-100 with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN.

Conclusion: Tracking gradient dynamics provides a direct approach to aligning theoretical expectations with empirical behaviors, benefiting practical optimization research.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework extending sparse autoencoders to lifted and infinite-dimensional spaces to enable interpretability of neural operators, emphasizing their utility in scientific computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are believed to converge on shared representations across architectures (Platonic Representation Hypothesis), yet the mechanics of neural operators remain underexplored despite their significance in scientific computing.

Method: The authors propose and investigate the performance of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators, focusing on their inference and training dynamics within different contexts.

Result: Lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, leading to faster recovery, improved learning of smooth concepts, and robust inference under different resolutions, which is unique to neural operators.

Conclusion: Lifted spaces and operator modules enhance the interpretability and representational power of neural operators, making their study increasingly relevant for dynamic and complex scientific tasks.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,

modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of Gaussian processes on graph data, especially when scaling to large graph sizes.

Method: Introduced and leveraged graph random features (GRFs) as stochastic estimators for graph node kernels, reducing computational cost.

Result: Achieved significant computational speed-ups, memory efficiency, and enabled Bayesian optimization on large-scale graphs (10^6+ nodes).

Conclusion: GRFs provide a scalable and efficient approach for Bayesian inference on graph data while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently

processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs
with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive

*Payam Abdisarabshali,Fardis Nadimi,Kasra Borazjani,Naji Khosravan,Minghui Liwang,Wei Ni,Dusit Niyato,Michael Langberg,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), an approach to extend multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models into federated learning frameworks for fog/edge networks, addressing challenges in modality and task heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing need for federated approaches to foundation models, especially multi-modal multi-task ones, in the context of leveraging geo-distributed data from wireless devices.

Method: HF-FMs are proposed by aligning M3T FM modular structures with hierarchical fog/edge infrastructures and integrating device-to-device communications for localized cooperative training.

Result: Prototyped the proposed framework in a wireless network setting and made the tools open-source to encourage research exploration.

Conclusion: HF-FMs provide unique capabilities to address challenges in modality and task heterogeneity for federated learning in fog/edge networks, signaling future innovative research directions.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR introduces a curvature-enhanced distance metric for Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE), tackling issues like cluster fragmentation and geometry preservation in high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address limitations of widely used SNE algorithms, such as UMAP and tSNE, which can fail in preserving data geometry and identifying clusters appropriately.

Method: EmbedOR incorporates discrete graph curvature into a distance metric to better capture the cluster structures and geometries, ensuring consistent embedding for broader datasets.

Result: EmbedOR shows improved performance in maintaining connection continuity and geometry preservation in synthetic and real datasets compared to UMAP and tSNE.

Conclusion: EmbedOR offers a robust alternative for visualizing high-dimensional data, minimizing fragmentation and enhancing understanding of data geometry.

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes solutions for the Online Testing Problem (OTP), where an algorithm selects optimal tests for subjects while considering costly and incomplete testing data. The authors provide theoretical bounds on regret and propose algorithms for different problem variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing efficient sequential testing policies when test outcomes are missing and costly, creating a need to balance exploration and exploitation.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the problem and propose two algorithms: an Explore-Then-Commit strategy for OTP and an iterative-elimination algorithm for a cost-sensitive variant of the problem. They provide regret bounds for both.

Result: The analysis shows that the minimax regret scales differently for OTP ($\Omega(T^{2/3})$) versus its variant ($\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$). Numerical results validate these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the complexity added by missing data, establishes theoretical regret bounds, and provides practical sequential testing approaches, advancing the study of exploration-exploitation trade-offs in online decision-making.

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy and validates its utility in both geometry and deep learning tasks through theoretical analysis and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between range-partition entropy, beneficial for algorithm design, and its accessibility/usefulness in deep learning.

Method: The paper proposes a differentiable range-partition entropy estimator, designs the EntropyNet module for low-entropy data restructuring, and extends entropy regularization to Transformer attention.

Result: The method achieves significant runtime speedup and negligible error in geometry, and improves accuracy while maintaining sparsity in deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: Differentiable entropy computation enhances efficiency and structured representation, making it a practical and theoretically sound approach for adaptive learning mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning failures in real-world, high-stakes, and socially sensitive scenarios hinder its adoption, especially in critical areas like medical diagnosis.

Method: The paper introduces causal and statistical structures contributing to machine learning failures and identifies two overlooked problems: no fair lunch and subgroup separability.

Result: It provides a critique of current fair representation learning methods, showing their limitations in solving the identified problems.

Conclusion: Future research should address the no fair lunch and subgroup separability problems to make machine learning methods more robust and fair.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of sparse labeled training data in satellite imagery machine learning (SatML) by introducing a new problem formulation for optimizing spatial training data under cost and budget constraints, along with novel methods to achieve this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite imagery machine learning faces challenges due to sparse and clustered labeled training data, limiting its practical applications in monitoring and prediction tasks. Addressing these limitations can enhance SatML's utility for various global tasks.

Method: The authors propose a new approach to optimize spatial training data while considering heterogeneous collection costs and budgetary constraints. They introduce simulation experiments across different settings to validate their strategies.

Result: The proposed methods achieve substantial performance gains in sample optimization across diverse tasks and regions. Specific settings where optimized sampling is particularly effective are identified.

Conclusion: The paper provides a generalizable framework for optimizing spatial training data in SatML applications and highlights its immediate utility in agricultural monitoring, particularly in places like Togo.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural

### [190] [Parking Availability Prediction via Fusing Multi-Source Data with A Self-Supervised Learning Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Inverted Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04362)
*Yin Huang,Yongqi Dong,Youhua Tang,Li Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces SST-iTransformer for parking availability prediction, showcasing superior performance through innovative techniques and spatio-temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in predicting parking availability due to spatio-temporal dependencies and multi-source data integration.

Method: The SST-iTransformer uses K-means clustering for parking zones, self-supervised learning, and dual-branch attention mechanisms to model dependencies.

Result: Experiments in Chengdu show SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline models with the lowest MSE, highlighting the importance of ride-hailing data and spatial correlations.

Conclusion: SST-iTransformer demonstrates its capability for accurate parking prediction, emphasizing spatial and multi-source data dependencies in urban planning.

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

*Alvaro Almeida Gomez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for approximating functions on manifolds using a data-driven approach based on Diffusion Maps, enhanced with dimensionality reduction and online updating mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of approximating real-valued functions on manifolds, particularly in high-dimensional settings, utilizing principles of geometric understanding such as the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

Method: The method exploits diffusion geometry and heat equation properties, applies SVD-based dimensionality reduction to tackle computational challenges, and introduces an online updating mechanism for scalability.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency in numerical experiments, outshining traditional neural networks and interpolation in tasks such as sparse CT reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully combines mathematical rigor with practical scalability, offering a robust alternative to classical techniques for function approximation on manifolds.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

### [192] [Learning an Adversarial World Model for Automated Curriculum Generation in MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel adversarial co-evolution framework where one agent (Attacker) generates challenging environments, and another team (Defenders) learns a policy to solve them, fostering complex behaviors and robust strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of hand-crafted training environments in creating generalizable and robust agents for embodied intelligence.

Method: The framework involves a generative Attacker agent designing challenging world states (enemy configurations) and a cooperative Defender team developing strategies to defeat them, driven by a goal-conditioned training process.

Result: Emergence of complex behaviors such as strategic formations and tactics like coordinated focus-fire and flanking from both Attacker and Defender agents.

Conclusion: Adversarial co-evolution effectively drives the development of instrumental world models and enhances strategic depth and robustness in agents.

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) to address efficient sparse-reward reinforcement learning by leveraging low-rank reward structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental properties of reward functions to enable efficient sparse-reward RL, specifically investigating how low-rank structure impacts sample complexity.

Method: Introducing PAMC, which utilizes matrix completion theory and policy-dependent sampling for reinforcement learning. It also establishes confidence sets and robust guarantees under approximate low-rank structures.

Result: PAMC improves sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 across various domains, while incurring minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Structural reward learning is a promising approach for improving efficiency in sample-expensive applications like robotics and healthcare.

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

*Xiannan Huang,Shuhan Qiu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ADAPT-Z, a method to improve time series forecasting under distribution shift by focusing on latent factor updates and addressing delayed feedback challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of distribution shifts in online time series forecasting, especially in scenarios that require continuous adaptation and deal with delayed true feedback.

Method: ADAPT-Z uses an adapter module combining current feature representations and historical gradient information for robust parameter updates to handle delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting.

Result: ADAPT-Z consistently outperformed existing base models and state-of-the-art online learning methods in experiments across various datasets.

Conclusion: ADAPT-Z effectively addresses distribution shifts in time series forecasting, providing a novel approach to handle delayed feedback and improving accuracy in challenging deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

### [195] [Machine Learning for LiDAR-Based Indoor Surface Classification in Intelligent Wireless Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03813)
*Parth Ashokbhai Shiroya,Swarnagowri Shashidhar,Amod Ashtekar,Krishna Aindrila Kar,Rafaela Lomboy,Dalton Davis,Mohammed E. Eltayeb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a LiDAR-based machine learning framework to classify indoor surfaces based on their scattering behavior in high-frequency communication networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency signals in mmWave and sub-THz networks are highly susceptible to blockages, and their reliable connectivity depends on the reflective characteristics of surrounding surfaces. Understanding how surface properties affect signal scattering is critical for enabling robust wireless communication.

Method: The authors used a machine learning framework driven by LiDAR data to classify indoor surfaces based on their scattering behavior. They collected a dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 indoor materials, partitioned them into patches, and extracted geometric and intensity features. These features were then used to train and evaluate Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers.

Result: Tree-based ensemble models, specifically Random Forests and XGBoost, outperformed neural networks in balancing classification accuracy and robustness. The framework effectively linked LiDAR-derived features to surface scattering properties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework can generate scattering-aware digital maps and environment models, enabling applications like adaptive beam management and enhanced connectivity in future network technologies.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

Recent advances in machine learning have provided an alternative way to study
data associated with traffic accidents. New models achieve good generalization
and high predictive power over imbalanced data. In this research, we study
neural network-based models on data related to traffic accidents. We begin
analyzing relative feature colinearity and unsupervised dimensionality
reduction through autoencoders, followed by a dense network. The features are
related to traffic accident data and the target is to classify accident
severity. Our experiments show cross-validated results of up to 92% accuracy
when classifying accident severity using the proposed deep neural network.

*Lucas Lopes Felipe,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Daniel Sadoc Menasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reinterprets the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for community detection as a potential hedonic game, proving its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Community detection is a crucial task in data science for grouping nodes into meaningful communities in a network.

Method: The authors decomposed the CPM's objective function into local utility functions, formulated stability criteria, and tested the model's accuracy through community tracking experiments.

Result: They proved CPM's convergence in pseudo-polynomial time, established stability criteria, and observed improved accuracy in identifying ground-truth communities when using robust partitions.

Conclusion: This approach offers a game-theoretic basis for efficient, robust, and accurate community detection, potentially enriching theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

*Kimia Ehsani,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight bird's-eye view (BEV) framework is proposed to enhance communication link quality predictions in V2I systems. This approach consistently improved performance across multiple tasks and showed robustness in adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve V2I communication link quality predictions, ensuring smoother handovers, better beam management, and robust low-latency communication by leveraging sensor data and addressing MLLMs' lack of spatial understanding.

Method: A BEV injection connector is introduced, fusing spatial context from neighboring vehicle data with the ego vehicle's inputs. Simulated scenarios using CARLA and MATLAB generate diverse data for training multimodal models.

Result: The BEV framework improved accuracy by up to 13.9% over the baseline, with gains increasing to 32.7% under adverse conditions like rain and nighttime.

Conclusion: The BEV injection framework enhances communication link quality predictions across varying tasks and conditions, demonstrating adaptability and robustness in V2I systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

*Yang Chen,Xiao Lin,Bo Yan,Libo Zhang,Jiamou Liu,Neset Özkan Tan,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work addresses the limitations of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) for heterogeneous and unknown objectives by proposing a deep latent variable MFG model and testing it on simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the challenge of reward function design for multi-agent systems, especially in real-world applications with heterogeneous, unknown objectives that existing IRL in MFG methods fail to effectively address due to their assumption of agent homogeneity.

Method: The authors introduce a deep latent variable model for MFGs and a corresponding IRL method to infer rewards for heterogeneous tasks without prior context knowledge, maintaining structural adaptability across tasks.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art IRL techniques for MFGs in both simulated scenarios and a real-world task involving spatial taxi-ride pricing.

Conclusion: Their method demonstrates the applicability and flexibility of using a deep latent variable MFG model for inferring reward functions in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, offering significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

TL;DR: The paper explores the intersection of data augmentation (DA) and quantization-aware knowledge distillation (KD) for low-precision models, proposing a novel metric to identify suitable DAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study recognizes the limited attention toward data augmentation in the context of quantization-aware KD, aiming to understand its influence on the performance of low-bit deep learning models.

Method: A new metric is introduced to evaluate DAs based on their ability to maximize contextual mutual information and maintain prediction accuracy relative to ground truth labels. This method works with minimal training overhead and is applicable across different KD or QAT algorithms.

Result: The proposed DA selection strategy, guided by the new metric, leads to significant performance improvements in QAT and KD models across various architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate data augmentation strategies in quantization-aware KD, validating the proposed metric's effectiveness in enhancing the performance of low-bit models.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MillGNN, a novel graph neural network-based approach for improving multi-variate time series forecasting by addressing lead-lag dependencies at hierarchical scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS forecasting methods fail to account for hierarchical lead-lag dependencies across multiple grouping scales, which are essential in capturing complex dynamics in real-world systems.

Method: MillGNN employs a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning module integrating cross-correlation and dynamic decaying features, alongside a hierarchical message passing framework that propagates lead-lag dependencies across scales.

Result: MillGNN outperformed 16 state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets, demonstrating superior performance in both long-term and short-term MTS forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MillGNN approach effectively captures lead-lag dependencies across hierarchical scales, enhancing MTS forecasting in terms of accuracy and efficiency for diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MLP neural network serves as a reliable, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease, based on urinary peptide biomarkers.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer

selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of sequence- and graph-based methods in protein representation learning, emphasizing the need to capture proteins' hierarchical organization.

Method: The proposed method includes the Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) for multi-level hierarchical representation and the Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet) for SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchies.

Result: TCPNet outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks in four protein representation learning tasks, particularly excelling in fold classification.

Conclusion: Hierarchical topological features, as implemented by Topotein, are crucial for advancing protein representation learning and understanding structural patterns.

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the theoretical limitations of online learning models by considering realistic computational constraints, such as caps on arithmetic operations.

*Delphine Longuet,Amira Elouazzani,Alejandro Penacho Riveiros,Nicola Bastianello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using hybrid AI systems for fault detection in satellites, ensuring their reliability through formal verification using the Marabou tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite component failures are challenging and costly, requiring a more reliable and early detection mechanism.

Method: Integrating hybrid AI systems for fault detection and verifying their local robustness using the Marabou formal verification tool.

Result: Quantified how much input perturbation models can handle before output stability is compromised, enhancing trust in uncertain conditions.

Conclusion: The approach improves the reliability and robustness of satellite fault detection systems.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses misalignment in machine learning models in healthcare by embedding clinical knowledge to ensure predictions align better with real-world expectations, without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve inconsistencies between ML model predictions and clinical experiential learning, such as misaligned predictions in cancer outcome models, to make healthcare applications of ML more reliable and useful.

Method: The study incorporates clinical knowledge via constraints to adapt machine learning models and analyzes their effects on predictions and performance in prostate cancer cases. Additionally, it explores feedback-driven alignment involving clinicians.

Result: Incorporating clinical constraints significantly improves alignment between ML predictions and clinical experiential learning, demonstrating feasibility without degradation in model performance.

Conclusion: Embedding clinical experience into healthcare ML models improves reliability and interpretability, resulting in predictions more aligned with expert understanding, supporting broader adoption in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedQuad, a method to address data heterogeneity in Federated Learning (FL) by optimizing intra-class and inter-class variance, resulting in better global model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity, limited training samples, and class imbalance in federated settings challenge the generalization of global models.

Method: FedQuad minimizes intra-class variance and maximizes inter-class variance across clients by disentangling data in the shared feature space using metric learning techniques.

Result: Evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets shows superior performance compared to existing methods in handling diverse data distributions.

Conclusion: FedQuad effectively addresses challenges of heterogeneity in FL, improving the global model's robustness and performance through representational learning techniques.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SP-CCI, a method that uses synthetic data to improve the reliability and compactness of prediction intervals for individual counterfactual outcomes, achieving better performance than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for counterfactual inference yield overly conservative prediction intervals, especially in cases of treatment imbalance and scarce counterfactual samples.

Method: SP-CCI enhances the calibration set by adding synthetic counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained model and uses conformal calibration with debiasing informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI).

Result: SP-CCI outperforms standard CCI methods by consistently reducing interval width across different datasets, maintaining theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage.

Conclusion: SP-CCI offers a significant improvement in prediction interval reliability and compactness, validated theoretically and empirically, making it a robust solution for counterfactual outcome inference.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

### [209] [Who Pays for Fairness? Rethinking Recourse under Social Burden](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04128)
*Ainhize Barrainkua,Giovanni De Toni,Jose Antonio Lozano,Novi Quadrianto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in algorithmic recourse, proposing a novel framework based on social burden and introducing MISOB to reduce disparities without affecting classifier accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing use of machine learning in sensitive applications requires not only fair classification but also actionable insights for individuals to reverse negative outcomes.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical model linking fairness in classification and recourse processes. They introduce a fairness framework centered on social burden and a practical algorithm called MISOB.

Result: MISOB reduces social burden disparities across groups in real-world datasets while maintaining the accuracy of the classifier.

Conclusion: This work improves fairness in algorithmic recourse through a social burden-based approach and demonstrates promising results without reducing classifier effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TAGAL, a method to produce synthetic tabular data using Large Language Models (LLMs) through an agentic, feedback-based workflow without additional LLM training. TAGAL matches or surpasses state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance machine learning classification tasks by improving the generation of synthetic tabular data leveraging LLMs.

Method: The approach uses LLMs in an iterative process with feedback integration and external knowledge, avoiding retraining LLMs, to produce and refine synthetic tabular data.

Result: TAGAL demonstrated comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods requiring LLM retraining, and superior outcomes over training-free methods in downstream ML tasks.

Conclusion: TAGAL’s agentic workflow using LLMs without retraining proves effective for synthetic data generation, suggesting novel directions for LLM-based workflows.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

### [211] [Attention as an Adaptive Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154)
*Peter Racioppo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), an advanced attention mechanism integrating a dynamical model into attention computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine attention mechanisms by leveraging a dynamics model for improved computation of attention weights.

Method: The authors model sequences as discrete representations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) and use a linear dynamics model with certain constraints to propagate pairwise uncertainties efficiently.

Result: The approach results in a closed-form solution for attention weights, which aligns with the maximum likelihood solution of the linear SDE, leading to computational gains and robust attention computation.

Conclusion: This work extends standard attention mechanisms, providing an efficient, robust method that generalizes to traditional dot-product attention under specific conditions.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised speech models on non-speech data, specifically for bioacoustic detection and classification.

Method: Analyzed transfer learning capabilities by applying models like HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS to bioacoustic tasks, using both linear probing techniques and downstream architectures to account for time-wise information and noise robustness.

Result: Models displayed competitive performance with fine-tuned bioacoustic specific models and demonstrated robust handling of noise and frequency range impacts.

Conclusion: Speech-based self-supervised learning presents an efficient and impactful framework for advancing bioacoustic research, emphasizing its broader applicability.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies membership inference attacks (MIAs) on time series forecasting models, introducing two new attack methods and evaluating their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored vulnerability of time series forecasting models to membership inference attacks, providing insights into privacy risks.

Method: Adapted multivariate LiRA and developed a novel Deep Time Series (DTS) attack; benchmarked these methods against other attacks on TUH-EEG and ELD datasets.

Result: Forecasting models like LSTM and N-HiTS are vulnerable, with user-level attacks achieving near-perfect detection, especially for longer prediction horizons and smaller datasets.

Conclusion: The study establishes new baselines for privacy risk in time series forecasting, highlighting the urgent need for mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

TL;DR: This paper critiques Cai and Wang (2020) on over-smoothing in GNNs, highlighting spectral conditions where Dirichlet energy decays exponentially and offering practical mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and advance the analysis of over-smoothing in graph neural networks (GNNs) through energy-based perspectives.

Method: Leveraging spectral conditions, using Dirichlet energy evaluations, and conducting experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification to test theoretical insights.

Result: Exponential decay of Dirichlet energy with depth under certain conditions, extended analysis to spectral polynomial filters, and experimental illustration of practical methods to alleviate over-smoothing.

Conclusion: The findings provide analytical clarity on over-smoothing and suggest actionable remedies, contributing both theory and practical strategies for GNN design.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

*Itai Gat,Heli Ben-Hamu,Marton Havasi,Daniel Haziza,Jeremy Reizenstein,Gabriel Synnaeve,David Lopez-Paz,Brian Karrer,Yaron Lipman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Set Block Decoding (SBD), a new approach for speeding up autoregressive language model inference, enabling multiple token generation in parallel without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands during the decoding phase of language model inference hinder practical deployment of autoregressive next token prediction models.

Method: Set Block Decoding (SBD) combines next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) in a single model. It enables parallel multi-token sampling using solvers from discrete diffusion literature and is implemented by fine-tuning existing NTP models with no architectural changes.

Result: SBD achieved a 3-5x reduction in forward passes during generation compared to traditional methods while maintaining the same performance, as demonstrated on Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B.

Conclusion: SBD offers a simple, flexible, and efficient paradigm to accelerate generation in language models without additional complexity, training hyperparameters, or accuracy loss.

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZooCast creates a unified system for picking the best Time Series Foundation Model (TSFM) for forecasting tasks, leveraging complementary model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers identified that no single TSFM works universally well for all time series patterns, presenting an opportunity to leverage the strengths of multiple models.

Method: ZooCast uses a One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm to build a unified embedding space where models are represented and matched efficiently for optimal selection in different tasks.

Result: Experiments show ZooCast achieves high performance in zero-shot forecasting benchmarks while adding new models progressively without much computational cost.

Conclusion: ZooCast effectively harnesses the diverse strengths of TSFMs, providing a scalable and efficient system for dynamic and accurate forecasting.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces supervised precision and recall metrics to evaluate the relationship phase in Dimensionality Reduction, helping to identify why cluster structures might be missing in projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing DR quality metrics that don't explain why expected cluster structures are absent in projections.

Method: The paper divides the DR process into relationship and mapping phases, and introduces precision and recall metrics to evaluate the relationship phase against an expected cluster structure defined by labels.

Result: The proposed metrics were applied to t-SNE and UMAP, and their utility was validated in guiding hyperparameter tuning, spotting projection artifacts, and assessing captured structures.

Conclusion: The approach improves the reliability and speed of the DR process by enabling better evaluation of expected cluster structures and uncovering issues in the relationship phase.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically examines the ability of state-space models (SSM) and transformer models to handle long-range dependencies, proposing a new formulation combining strengths of both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent sequence models like SSMs and transformers aim to improve long-range dependency prediction, but lack a theoretical evaluation of their effectiveness.

Method: The authors define long-range dependency mathematically using derivatives of hidden states with respect to past inputs and evaluate models based on this definition. They also propose a new hidden state update formulation for SSM.

Result: SSM models' long-range dependency decays exponentially, while transformers exhibit greater flexibility in dependency modeling. The proposed SSM formulation offers computational efficiency while retaining flexibility of attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Combining flexibility of attention mechanisms with SSM's computational efficiency is feasible and could improve sequence modeling performance.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified analytical framework for Layer-wise Gaussian Mechanisms (LGM) to optimize noise allocation in differentially private deep learning, addressing deficiencies in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise allocation strategies in LGM lack a rigorous theoretical basis, which undermines optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Method: The authors develop a framework that connects layer-wise noise injection strategies to their optimization objectives and privacy budget allocations, proposing a new SNR-Consistent noise allocation scheme.

Result: Experiments in centralized and federated learning confirm that the proposed strategy consistently outperforms existing approaches in privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The paper provides both diagnostic insights into previous methods and theoretical guidance for creating more adaptive, efficient noise injection schemes for deep models.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

Result: RL demonstrates better retention of prior capabilities by targeting KL-divergence minimal solutions for new tasks, while SFT does not guarantee this.

Conclusion: On-policy RL offers a principled fine-tuning approach, summarized as 'RL's Razor,' preserving prior knowledge more effectively than SFT.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

### [222] [An Interactive Framework for Finding the Optimal Trade-off in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04290)
*Yaohong Yang,Aki Rehn,Sammie Katt,Antti Honkela,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the optimization of privacy-accuracy trade-offs in differential privacy by leveraging unique problem structure and improving preference learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to find the optimal trade-off between privacy guarantees and model performance in differential privacy, framed as a multi-objective optimization problem.

Method: The authors model the trade-off curve theoretically to efficiently generate the Pareto front and replace pairwise comparisons with hypothetical trade-off curves for more informative preference elicitation.

Result: Experiments on logistic regression, transfer learning, and six datasets demonstrate superior convergence to optimal trade-offs with reduced computational and user interaction costs.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves better efficiency in identifying privacy-accuracy trade-offs by utilizing problem-specific structure and improving user feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

*Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AT-UCB, a method leveraging causal abstraction across multiple abstraction levels to improve decision-making in causal multi-armed bandits (CMABs), reducing regret compared to classical UCB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a general methodology for exploiting computational and informational advantages across different abstraction levels in CMABs, enabling more efficient decision-making.

Method: The authors propose AT-UCB, an algorithm that uses causal abstraction theory to explore coarse-grained, less costly CMABs, followed by employing the UCB algorithm on a narrowed set of optimal actions in high-resolution CMABs.

Result: Empirical studies showed that AT-UCB achieves significant reductions in cumulative regret compared to the classical UCB algorithm, with theoretical backing through a novel regret upper bound.

Conclusion: AT-UCB demonstrates theoretical and practical benefits in decision-making by efficiently leveraging multiple levels of abstraction, showcasing its utility in real-world applications like epidemiological simulations.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

*Haley Dozier,Althea Henslee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven approach to model and assess energy usage behaviors in U.S. Army installations, aiming to improve climate resilience and readiness against energy disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U.S. Army installations face increasing risks from climate change, extreme weather, and vulnerabilities in energy systems, necessitating improved climate resilience and energy usage insights for mission readiness.

Method: A behavioral model will be developed to analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal energy usage data of non-residential buildings, using open access data as a framework for the methodology.

Result: The study will provide energy usage behavior profiles for creating baseline assessments of energy disruptions' impact and benchmarking resiliency measures.

Conclusion: The methodology can enhance awareness of energy vulnerabilities and support strategic measures to improve resilience in Army installations against climate and energy-related risks.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

### [225] [When three experiments are better than two: Avoiding intractable correlated aleatoric uncertainty by leveraging a novel bias--variance tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04363)
*Paul Scherer,Andreas Kirsch,Jake P. Taylor-King*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on handling heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty in experimental scenarios to improve active learning, particularly through new strategies based on bias-variance tradeoff and leveraging historical data via eigendecomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental scenarios often involve uncertainty, and managing this uncertainty is crucial for reducing errors and improving model performance.

Method: The paper develops active learning strategies using the bias-variance framework, incorporates historical data through a cobias-covariance relationship, and suggests batch processing via eigendecomposition techniques.

Result: The proposed methods, especially the difference-based approach using the cobias-covariance relationship with a quadratic estimator, outperform established techniques like BALD and Least Confidence in batched settings.

Conclusion: Carefully managing uncertainties and leveraging historical data can effectively enhance the performance of active learning systems, making the proposed techniques valuable alternatives to existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

### [226] [PagedEviction: Structured Block-wise KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04377)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Jie Ye,Xian-He Sun,Anthony Kougkas,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PagedEviction, a memory optimization strategy for KV caching in Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing memory bottlenecks for long sequences while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses memory inefficiency in LLM inference caused by growing KV cache sizes as sequence lengths increase, which becomes a significant bottleneck in long context tasks.

Method: PagedEviction is a block-wise KV cache pruning strategy tailored for paged memory layouts. Unlike prior methods, it integrates efficiently with PagedAttention without needing changes to CUDA attention kernels, optimizing memory usage finely and systematically.

Result: PagedEviction showed improved memory efficiency while maintaining or enhancing accuracy on long context tasks when tested on various Llama models (3.1-8B-Instruct, 3.2-1B-Instruct, and 3.2-3B-Instruct) using the LongBench benchmark suite.

Conclusion: PagedEviction effectively addresses KV cache memory bottlenecks, enhancing the scalability of LLM inference for long sequence tasks without compromising performance.

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

*Zidong Wang,Yiyuan Zhang,Xiaoyu Yue,Xiangyu Yue,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transition Models (TiM), a novel generative paradigm that addresses fidelity versus computation trade-offs in generative modeling, surpassing state-of-the-art models despite having fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often face a dilemma between fidelity and efficiency; iterative models excel in quality but are computationally costly, while faster alternatives hit a quality ceiling.

Method: The authors propose a continuous-time dynamics equation for state transitions and develop Transition Models (TiM) to enable arbitrary-step generative processes that adapt from single-step to detailed iterative refinement.

Result: TiM demonstrates superior performance over leading models with higher parameters, achieves consistent quality improvement with more sampling steps, and excels in high-resolution images up to 4096x4096.

Conclusion: TiM successfully bridges the gap between iterative fidelity and computational efficiency, offering a scalable, high-quality solution for generative tasks at various resolutions.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

### [228] [IPA: An Information-Preserving Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398)
*Yuan Yin,Shashanka Venkataramanan,Tuan-Hung Vu,Andrei Bursuc,Matthieu Cord*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPA, a new framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which improves over methods like LoRA by employing feature-aware projections and preserving more information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT methods like LoRA suffer from performance bottlenecks due to randomly-initialized, data-agnostic down-projections, which discard useful information.

Method: The paper proposes IPA, which incorporates feature-aware projections using algorithms for approximating top principal components to preserve critical information efficiently in the reduced space.

Result: IPA achieves significant performance gains over LoRA on benchmarks, including 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points higher accuracy on VTAB-1k, while using fewer trainable parameters when projections are frozen.

Conclusion: IPA effectively addresses the limitations of prior PEFT methods by introducing efficient, information-preserving projections, offering better performance with reduced adaptation parameters.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

### [229] [Interpretable Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning in Mixed Observational Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04415)
*Wenrui Li,Qinghao Zhang,Xiaowo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents HCL, an unsupervised framework for discovering and interpreting causal heterogeneity in mixed-type observational data, enhancing results in domains like biology and medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately address causal heterogeneity, confounding factors, and observational constraints, leading to challenges in interpretation and distinction between genuine causal relationships and spurious correlations.

Method: HCL integrates latent cluster inference and adaptive causal structure learning from data, employing techniques such as bi-directional iterative refinement and self-supervised regularization.

Result: HCL significantly improves clustering and causal structure learning, demonstrating high empirical accuracy and identifying biologically relevant mechanisms in single-cell perturbation datasets.

Conclusion: HCL provides a robust approach for interpretable discovery of heterogeneous causal patterns, advancing causal inference methodology under observational settings.

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

*Xingtai Lv,Yuxin Zuo,Youbang Sun,Hongyi Liu,Yuntian Wei,Zhekai Chen,Lixuan He,Xuekai Zhu,Kaiyan Zhang,Bingning Wang,Ning Ding,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for post-training language models, combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning into a single optimization perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the separate use of online and offline data in post-training language models, and to unify them under a common optimization process for improved effectiveness.

Method: The authors derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, breaking it into four parts, and propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that combines diverse training signals dynamically.

Result: HPT demonstrated superior performance on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, outperforming strong baselines across different model scales and families.

Conclusion: The unified theoretical framework and HPT approach effectively reconcile the strengths of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, achieving more efficient and stable post-training performance.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

*Pradeep Singh,Balasubramanian Raman*

TL;DR: This paper reinterprets Echo State Networks (ESNs) as state-space models (SSMs) and develops a systems-theoretic framework to improve their understanding and design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESNs are often designed based on heuristics with limited theoretical grounding. The study aims to bridge this gap by recasting ESNs as state-space models to better understand their dynamics and design principles.

Method: The authors derive theoretical stability conditions, develop mappings to understand ESN dynamics, and propose advanced learning methods including Kalman filtering and expectation-maximization (EM) for optimized parameter tuning.

Result: The research provides frequency-domain analyses of ESN memory properties, clarifies their relationship with structured SSMs, and introduces improved learning methods that optimize ESNs' internal dynamics and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: By framing ESNs within a robust state-space modeling framework, this work offers a principled approach for better understanding, designing, and optimizing them for various applications.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding why recent tabular deep learning techniques succeed, focusing particularly on the concept of data uncertainty.

Method: The study dissects mechanisms like feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models, and ensembling strategies to explore their roles in managing data uncertainty.

Result: Discovering how data uncertainty underpins the success of various tabular DL methods, leading to the development of improved numerical feature embeddings.

Conclusion: The analysis offers a deeper understanding of modern tabular methods, enabling strategy advancements and guiding future research in tabular deep learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

TL;DR: Proposes Delta Activations, a method to embed finetuned models as vectors based on activation shifts for better task/domain clustering, improving navigation and reusability of Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely adapted for specific tasks and domains but are often hard to navigate due to inconsistent metadata and disorganized repositories.

Method: Delta Activations measure shifts in model activations compared to a base model and represent these shifts as vector embeddings, enabling clustering by task and domain.

Result: Delta Activations are robust across settings, additive for mixed datasets, and can embed tasks using few-shot finetuning. They improve model selection, merging, and understanding of finetuned models.

Conclusion: Delta Activations streamline navigation and utilization of Large Language Models by effectively clustering models and tasks, enhancing their reusability for the community.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

*Cyrus Cousins,Vijay Keswani,Vincent Conitzer,Hoda Heidari,Jana Schaich Borg,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new modeling approach to better capture human decision-making processes by addressing limitations in standard AI preference elicitation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods fail to account for the true cognitive processes humans use in decision-making, such as heuristics, leading to mismatches between modeled and actual human behavior.

Method: The authors use an axiomatic approach to model human decision-making during pairwise comparisons, with structured processing that reflects real cognitive processes, leveraging rules like Bradley-Terry for feature aggregation.

Result: The proposed approach was tested in a kidney allocation task and demonstrated superior performance, both interpretability-wise and accuracy-wise, compared to previous models.

Conclusion: The paper highlights that cognitively faithful models can better reflect human decision-making processes and improve the alignment and generalization of AI systems to human-like behavior.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack both multivariate time series coupled with dependency structure and real-world anomaly labels, hindering forecasting and anomaly detection advancement in microservice systems.

Method: ChronoGraph organizes real-world microservice metrics as nodes and edges, offering a dependency graph, anomaly labels, and tasks for future forecasting and detection. Baseline models are evaluated to benchmark its utility.

Result: Baseline evaluations with forecasting models, pretrained foundation models, and anomaly detectors are provided to validate ChronoGraph as an effective benchmark.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph advances research on forecasting and anomaly detection in microservice systems by combining multivariate graphs, dependencies, and incident annotations for realistic evaluations.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

### [236] [Integrating Pruning with Quantization for Efficient Deep Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04244)
*Sara Makenali,Babak Rokh,Ali Azarpeyvand*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by integrating pruning and quantization techniques to reduce model size and computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of DNNs on devices with limited resources is difficult due to their large size, necessitating effective compression techniques like pruning and quantization.

Method: The paper proposes two methods: (1) applying similarity-based filter pruning and quantization simultaneously during training, and (2) performing pruning first, followed by Adaptive Power-of-Two quantization using low-bit representations.

Result: The proposed methods achieved significant model compression with minimal accuracy loss, as validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: Integrating pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two quantization is shown to be an effective strategy for compressing DNNs, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide
range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,
which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this
issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,
commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance
processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even
greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization
to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily
due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly
optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that
integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)
quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model
accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied
simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed
first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the
pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal
accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with
limited computational resources.

### [237] [When Lifetimes Liberate: A Type System for Arenas with Higher-Order Reachability Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04253)
*Siyuan He,Songlin Jia,Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper integrates concepts from region-based systems, ownership types, and reachability types to allow static safety and flexible resource sharing in higher-order functional languages, introducing novel models for managing resource lifetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource management in higher-order functional languages faces challenges in balancing control, flexibility, and expressiveness; previous systems addressing this lack practical tools for both sharing and lifetime control simultaneously.

Method: The authors propose two extensions of reachability types: A<: and {A}<:. A<: introduces a two-dimensional store model for coarse reachability tracking, while {A}<: formalizes lexical lifetime control with static guarantees.

Result: The proposed extensions enable static safety guarantees with flexible resource sharing in higher-order functional languages, maintaining expressiveness and the higher-order parametric nature of the language across resource management modes.

Conclusion: The work successfully unifies the strengths of existing approaches, offering robust tools for managing resource lifetimes and sharing patterns in higher-order functional languages through formalized, type-safe calculi.

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

*Quan Quan,Jiwen Xu,Runxiao Liu,Yi Ding,Jiaxing Che,Kai-Yuan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a decentralized, physics-inspired method for cooperative aerial transportation using robot swarms, achieving robust and scalable performance without relying on explicit communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aerial transportation struggle with scalability, communication dependency, and lack of robustness in dynamic environments. There is a need for a system that can handle these challenges, offering transformative potential for logistics and disaster response.

Method: The paper proposes a decentralized, dissipative force model inspired by table-leg load distribution mechanics. Each flying robot adjusts its position dynamically based on its local environment and payload without explicit communication. The stability of the control system is analytically proven.

Result: Simulations showed the proposed approach significantly reduced tracking errors compared to other methods. Real-world experiments demonstrated a 94% success rate under challenging conditions such as robot failure, payload variation, and outdoor winds up to Beaufort scale 4.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable and robust framework for cooperative aerial transportation, bridging swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, suitable for complex tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for two-robot cooperative grasping and object transport in constrained environments using a Conditional Embedding model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying feasible grasp configurations for two-robot systems to collaboratively transport objects in complex and diverse environments.

Method: The authors propose a Conditional Embedding model with two neural networks trained on a diverse dataset of environment maps and object shapes using supervised learning with negative sampling.

Result: Simulations demonstrate reliable identification of grasp configurations across varied environments and objects, and experiments on a physical robotic platform validate practical applicability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables robots to collaboratively grasp and transport objects, even in constrained and diverse settings, showcasing its reliability and generalizability.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Efficient Virtuoso', a conditional latent diffusion model for future trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicles, aiming at precision and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for models that can generate diverse, plausible, and high-fidelity future trajectories for autonomous vehicle systems while balancing computational efficiency and control.

Method: They propose a latent diffusion model utilizing a two-stage normalization of trajectories and a PCA latent space, combined with a Transformer-based StateEncoder and a simple MLP denoiser.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a minADE of 0.25 on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Conclusion: Strategically ambiguous trajectories benefit from endpoint goals, but precise human-like tactical execution requires a multi-step sparse route representation.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Result: Tested on a custom AUV, the approach demonstrated real-time performance and improved simulation fidelity, adapting to underwater conditions efficiently.

Conclusion: The presented method enhances simulation accuracy and scalability, making it suitable for underwater robotics research without reliance on precomputed models.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater

compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested

TL;DR: The paper introduces INGRID, a framework that automates the design of parallel robotic mechanisms using AI and kinematic synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decouple the advancement of robotic intelligence from hardware constraints imposed by traditional serial mechanisms.

Method: The design process involves four tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and mechanism design, leveraging reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis within the INGRID framework.

Result: Demonstrated the automatic generation of novel parallel robotic mechanisms, including configurations previously undocumented in the literature.

Conclusion: INGRID expands accessibility to designing task-specific parallel robots, bridging mechanism theory and AI, and paving the way for hardware design in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Motivation: To address challenges like extended task horizons and partial observability in quadruped-based mobile manipulation by creating a system for complex, real-world tasks.

Method: A visuo-motor policy is trained entirely in simulation to perform multi-stage pick-and-place tasks, emphasizing efficient training, sim-to-real transfer, and emergent behaviors.

Result: Achieved nearly 80% success in real-world applications, with behaviors like re-grasping and task chaining, as well as successful deployment in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that visuo-motor policies trained in simulation can be highly effective for real-world quadruped-based mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and
effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment

*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-arm visuotactile framework for manipulating crumpled and suspended garments, addressing challenges like material dynamics and self-occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current garment manipulation systems struggle with occlusions, complex configurations, and material variability, necessitating more robust and adaptable techniques.

Method: The researchers developed a framework combining dense visual correspondence trained on a simulated dataset and tactile-supervised grasp affordance validated by real-time feedback.

Result: The system demonstrated efficacy in folding and hanging tasks while providing reusable dense descriptors as intermediate representations for broader applications.

Conclusion: This framework shows promise for more adaptable and scalable garment manipulation, broadening its applicability beyond specialized tasks.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a robust pose estimation system for wall-climbing robots, integrating multimodal data using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). It addresses challenges posed by complex building geometries and validates its methodology through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of precise pose estimation for wall-climbing robots operating in environments where traditional and GPS-based localization methods fail due to surface complexity and signal issues.

Method: The study integrates wheel odometry, visual odometry, and IMU data using EKF and UKF filters, calibrates robot parameters with nonlinear optimization, and validates with experimental testing.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrated the improved performance of the multimodal data fusion approach and effectiveness of proposed calibration methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pose estimator enhances the reliability and precision of wall-climbing robots' pose estimation in challenging operational environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Motivation: The need to address challenges like network latency, security, and resource management in integrating cloud computing with robotics.

Method: Developed a scalable framework with two components: a containerized cloud cluster and robot simulation environment, connected via a UDP tunnel that simulates realistic network conditions.

Result: The framework simulates network variability, such as delays and jitters, allowing realistic testing of cloud-robot systems, particularly for aerial robots in remote control scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves testing of cloud-robot systems by enabling scalable and realistic simulations of network conditions.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional perception-planning pipelines struggle with open-ended tasks, and end-to-end Vision-Language-Action models lack failure anticipation and recovery mechanisms.

Method: FPC-VLA integrates a Vision-Language-Action model with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor analyzes action viability using vision-language queries, provides corrective strategies, and employs a similarity-guided fusion module for refining actions.

Result: FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in task success rates across multiple simulation platforms and robotic embodiments. It shows strong generalization and minimal execution time impact by activating the supervisor only at keyframes.

Conclusion: The proposed FPC-VLA framework is effective and practical for improving robotic manipulation reliability, paving the way for more robust autonomous systems.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel
communication concept for efficiently transmitting integrated wheel sensor data
from an ESP32 microcontroller. Our proposed approach utilizes a

regarding data transmission volume. We tested this approach on a drum tire test
rig with our prototype sensors system utilizing a diverse selection of sample

*Hongyin Zhang,Shiyuan Zhang,Junxi Jin,Qixin Zeng,Yifan Qiao,Hongchao Lu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM), an offline reinforcement learning algorithm to improve action accuracy in Vision-Language-Action models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the limitation of current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in handling complex downstream tasks due to reliance only on imitation learning post-training.

Method: The paper proposes an offline RL post-training objective for VLA models and integrates ARFM, which uses an adaptively adjusted scaling factor for bias-variance trade-off in the learning process.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate ARFM's improved performance in generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning.

Conclusion: ARFM offers a principled approach to enhance the efficiency and stability of VLA model fine-tuning using reinforcement learning signals.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

### [252] [Keypoint-based Diffusion for Robotic Motion Planning on the NICOL Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04076)
*Lennart Clasmeier,Jan-Gerrit Habekost,Connor Gäde,Philipp Allgeuer,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diffusion-based deep learning approach for robotic motion planning, achieving faster runtime and good effectiveness compared to numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical motion planning methods have high runtime requirements, prompting exploration of faster alternatives using deep learning.

Method: A diffusion-based action model leveraging deep learning is trained on a dataset (refined after identifying biases), using point cloud embeddings and joint sequence predictions.

Result: The refined model achieved collision-free solutions up to 90% success rate and significantly reduced runtime compared to numerical models.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based model offers a highly efficient alternative to traditional numerical planners, even without point cloud embeddings.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

### [253] [Object-Reconstruction-Aware Whole-body Control of Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04094)
*Fatih Dursun,Bruno Vilhena Adorno,Simon Watson,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computationally efficient view path planning method for object reconstruction and inspection using mobile manipulators, achieving comparable performance to traditional methods while being around nine times faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in computational complexity of traditional sampling-based path planning methods in object reconstruction and inspection tasks.

Method: The proposed method computes a focus point in the most informative (unknown) region and integrates this point into the mobile manipulator's whole-body control, eliminating the need for additional path planning.

Result: The simulations and experiments showed the proposed method is approximately nine times faster than sampling-based methods without sacrificing object coverage or entropy.

Conclusion: The method provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional sampling-based strategies for view path planning, with significant time savings and comparable reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

*Ke Wu,Yuhao Wang,Kevin Henry,Cesare Stefanini,Gang Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers introduced a novel modeling framework, LASEM, for cable-driven continuum robots, offering accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuum robots, modeled after natural structures like octopus arms, are advantageous in complex environments, but their highly deformable structures necessitate precise and efficient modeling for effective motion planning and control.

Method: The LASEM framework constructs a direct actuation potential energy model in actuation space using geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via Hamilton's principle. It integrates static and kinematic inputs and accommodates various robot complexities while remaining efficient. Numerical validation and iterative schemes refine its implementation.

Result: LASEM demonstrated accuracy through numerical simulations. It supports both real-time usage and the integration of practical design elements by leveraging numerical optimization for functional minimization.

Conclusion: LASEM provides a unified, computationally efficient modeling approach for continuum robots, addressing key challenges in motion planning and control without requiring explicit cable-backbone contact modeling.

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

*Chen Hu,Shan Luo,Letizia Gionfrida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OVGrasp is a control framework designed for soft exoskeleton grasp assistance, using a mix of vision, language, and voice commands to adapt in diverse environments. It achieves a high grasp success rate and natural hand motion alignment, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grasping assistance methods struggle to adapt to unpredictable environments with diverse objects and user intentions, limiting autonomy for individuals with motor impairments.

Method: OVGrasp integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, voice commands, and a vision-language foundation model for zero-shot object detection. A hierarchical control framework infers user intent via multimodal cues.

Result: Systematic tests on 15 objects and 10 participants show OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score of 87.00%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with enhanced kinematic alignment.

Conclusion: OVGrasp advances grasp assistance technologies by integrating multimodal interaction, enabling robust object detection and improving autonomy in motor-impaired individuals.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

*Hao-Shu Fang,Branden Romero,Yichen Xie,Arthur Hu,Bo-Ruei Huang,Juan Alvarez,Matthew Kim,Gabriel Margolis,Kavya Anbarasu,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Edward Adelson,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DEXOP is a passive hand exoskeleton system that enables efficient data collection for dexterous robotic manipulation by mirroring human hand movements to a robot hand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of teleoperation in transferring manipulation skills to robots and improve data collection for robotic dexterity tasks.

Method: Develop a passive hand exoskeleton, DEXOP, which connects human hands to robot hands to collect sensory data while mirroring human hand poses and providing proprioceptive feedback.

Result: DEXOP efficiently collects high-quality demonstration data, improving task performance significantly compared to teleoperation.

Conclusion: DEXOP offers a natural, efficient way to gather data for advancing robotic manipulation capabilities and reduces the time needed for data collection without compromising quality.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Egocentric Mobile Manipulation (EMMA), a framework that uses human mobile manipulation data and static robot data to train mobile manipulation policies, eliminating the need for robot teleoperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile manipulation learning relies heavily on robot teleoperation, which is costly and limits scalability.

Method: The authors developed EMMA, an end-to-end framework where human full-body motion data is co-trained with static robot data to train manipulation policies without teleoperation.

Result: EMMA achieves comparable or superior performance to teleoperated robot frameworks in three real-world tasks, generalizes to new scenes, and scales positively with increasing human data.

Conclusion: EMMA offers a scalable alternative to robot teleoperation for training mobile manipulation policies, with promising results in generalization and task performance.

Abstract: Scaling mobile manipulation imitation learning is bottlenecked by expensive
mobile robot teleoperation. We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA),
an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile
manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To
accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot
data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates
comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data
(Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task
success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations
and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the
hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in
real-world environments. Details of this project can be found at

*Chong Wang,Haoning Wu,Peng Liang,Maya Daneva,Marten van Sinderen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the use of datasets in requirements engineering (RE) research for mobile apps, identifying trends, challenges, and potential areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the state of datasets used for RE research in mobile apps, particularly concerning the platforms providing these datasets and the specific RE activities researched.

Method: The authors performed a systematic mapping study, adhering to Kitchenham's guidelines, to review 43 papers on the topic.

Result: The study found over 90% of datasets in RE research come from Google Play and Apple App Store. Requirements elicitation and analysis are the most researched activities using these datasets.

Conclusion: There has been an increasing use of datasets since 2012. However, RE knowledge for mobile apps may be biased due to reliance on dominant platforms like Google Play and Apple App Store. The field would benefit from diversifying data sources and exploring under-researched RE activities.

Abstract: [Background] Research on requirements engineering (RE) for mobile apps
employs datasets formed by app users, developers or vendors. However, little is
known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on
datasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]
Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.

*Cheng-Yang Tsai,Tzu-Wei Huang,Jen-Wei Shih,I-Hsiang Wang,Yu-Cheng Lin,Rung-Bin Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical Random Forest-based approach to automate error detection in APB transactions from VCD files, achieving 91.36% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in manual error detection for APB transaction errors in large VCD files and meet the ICCAD 2025 Contest Problem D requirements.

Method: The study uses a hierarchical Random Forest-based architecture comprising four pre-trained binary classifiers for staged diagnosis of specific errors, prioritizing address-related faults before data errors.

Result: The proposed framework achieved 91.36% accuracy, excelling in precision and recall for address-related faults and maintaining robust performance for data errors.

Conclusion: Hierarchical machine learning demonstrates its effectiveness as a powerful automated tool for functional hardware debugging, validated through competitive performance in the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest.

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful
automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

### [260] [Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668)
*Matt Rau,Chris Brown,John Edwards*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces algorithms to track parse tree nodes over time, enabling new analyses of student programming behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of analyzing programming process data, including tracking high-level code representations over time and through unparseable states.

Method: Two algorithms were designed: one to track parse tree nodes through time and another to handle unparseable code states. These were applied to analyze public keystroke data from a CS1 course.

Result: The study revealed insights, such as similar rates of code deletion inside and outside loops, restoration of commented-out code, and non-correlation of code-jumping frequency with struggle.

Conclusion: The introduced capability to track parse trees through time enables deeper understandings of student programming behavior, potentially informing best practices and interventions.

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

*Rodrigo Oliveira Zacarias,Rodrigo Pereira dos Santos,Patricia Lago*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel conceptual model, SECO-TransDX, which focuses on transparency in software ecosystems (SECO) from a developer experience (DX) perspective, identifying 63 interrelated factors that influence developer interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparency in software ecosystems is essential for trust, fairness, and engagement, but its specific relationship with developer experience has not been systematically studied.

Method: The authors developed SECO-TransDX, a conceptual model based on prior research and refined using a Delphi study with experts from both academia and industry.

Result: The model unveils 63 interrelated concepts, shedding light on how transparency impacts developer experience across technical, social, and organizational domains.

Conclusion: SECO-TransDX provides a structured framework for researchers to explore transparency's impact on developer experience and helps practitioners design more transparent, developer-friendly platforms for long-term engagement.

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

### [262] [VulRTex: A Reasoning-Guided Approach to Identify Vulnerabilities from Rich-Text Issue Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03875)
*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Guowei Yang,Lin Shi,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces VulRTex, a tool leveraging reasoning-guided Large Language Models for identifying vulnerability-related issue reports in open-source software by integrating comprehensive rich-text analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to automatically identify vulnerability-related issue reports (IRs) in open-source software (OSS) to reduce the manual effort by security practitioners and mitigate potential system exploitation during time delays.

Method: VulRTex uses a reasoning-guided approach by preparing a Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. It retrieves relevant cases to generate reasoning guidance and applies reasoning analysis on the rich-text information of target IRs using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: Experiments using 973,572 IRs demonstrated VulRTex's superior performance over baselines, showing a +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and +10.5% Macro-F1 improvement, and halving time costs. Furthermore, it identified 30 vulnerabilities in GitHub IRs for 2024, 11 of which were assigned CVE-IDs.

Conclusion: VulRTex shows practical and enhanced performance for identifying vulnerability-related IRs in OSS, demonstrating effectiveness in both accuracy and time efficiency.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of tools for identifying software versions affected by vulnerabilities, revealing fundamental limitations and proposing areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the availability of tools for identifying vulnerable software versions, their real-world performance remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes and outdated approaches.

Method: The study evaluates 12 tools across four dimensions using a benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities: vulnerability/version-level effectiveness, error causes, sensitivity to patch characteristics, and ensemble strategies.

Result: No tool achieves higher than 45.0% accuracy, and ensemble approaches only improve accuracy to below 60.0%. Key challenges include heuristic dependence, limited reasoning capabilities, and rigid matching logic.

Conclusion: Current tools are inadequate for identifying affected software versions accurately, and fundamentally new approaches are needed to overcome inherent limitations. A benchmark is provided for future research.

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained

### [264] [Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896)
*Zushuai Zhang,Elliott Wen,Ewan Tempero*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how code smells interact and affect dependencies between modules in software systems, revealing that interactions between code smells heighten overall dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how code smells interact and influence static dependencies between modules, which can complicate and increase the cost of software maintenance.

Method: The researchers analyzed the static dependencies of code smells and their interactions by examining 116 open-source Java systems and comparing smell interaction data.

Result: Interactions between code smells are associated with an increase in total dependencies, with Feature Envy methods and Data Classes showing a sevenfold rise in median dependencies compared to their non-smelly counterparts.

Conclusion: Developers should focus on addressing interacting code smells rather than isolated code smells, as these pose greater challenges in dependency management and software maintainability.

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Auth Shim, a proxy service enabling secure integration of open-source software with enterprise single sign-on protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of native support in OSS tools for SAML or OIDC protocols creates security gaps for enterprise use.

Method: An architectural pattern called Auth Shim was developed as a proxy service to translate enterprise IdP requests into compatible session management for OSS tools.

Result: The paper showcases successful implementation at Adobe for integrating an OSS tool with Okta SAML, achieving automated RBAC and eliminating manual user provisioning.

Conclusion: Auth Shim provides a secure and cost-effective method for integrating standalone OSS with enterprise security systems, advancing open-source adoption without compromising governance.

Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but
standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,
creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to

### [266] [RepoDebug: Repository-Level Multi-Task and Multi-Language Debugging Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04078)
*Jingjing Liu,Zeming Liu,Zihao Cheng,Mengliang He,Xiaoming Shi,Yuhang Guo,Xiangrong Zhu,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents RepoDebug, a new dataset for evaluating repository-level debugging by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have excelled in function-level code repair but struggle with repository-level debugging due to insufficient and limited datasets.

Method: RepoDebug was created as a repository-level debugging dataset encompassing 22 error subtypes, 8 programming languages, and 3 tasks, followed by evaluation of 10 LLMs.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnect emerged as the best-performing model but still exhibited poor performance in repository-level debugging.

Conclusion: Repository-level debugging remains a challenge for LLMs, requiring more robust datasets and model improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

*Haowei Quan,Junjie Wang,Xinzhe Li,Terry Yue Zhuo,Xiao Chen,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyVul, a benchmark suite for Python-package vulnerabilities, and evaluates existing tools' limitations using it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vulnerabilities in Python packages, especially given their multi-language nature and the lack of effective vulnerability detection tools.

Method: Develop PyVul, a benchmark suite with 1,157 vulnerabilities, leveraging LLM for data cleansing and providing multi-level annotations.

Result: PyVul achieved 100% commit-level and 94% function-level annotation accuracy, highlighting vulnerability trends and challenges in existing detectors.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for more advanced detection tools to address complex, multi-language vulnerabilities affecting Python packages.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaaSGuard integrates security measures into all stages of the serverless DevSecOps lifecycle, enhancing safety without disrupting workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of comprehensive security strategies for serverless platforms, especially for open-source environments like OpenFaaS.

Method: Proposed FaaSGuard, a DevSecOps pipeline with lightweight and fail-closed security checks integrated into planning, coding, building, deployment, and monitoring stages.

Result: FaaSGuard achieves high precision (95%) and recall (91%) in detecting vulnerabilities, validated via a case study on 20 real-world serverless functions.

Conclusion: FaaSGuard successfully enhances security for serverless applications while maintaining CI/CD efficiency and detecting critical threats.

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a centralized web platform to connect blood donors and patients, streamlining connections and improving efficiency in emergencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Locating suitable blood donors during emergencies is challenging, and the paper seeks to address this by centralizing donor-patient connections.

Method: The platform employs modern web technologies like PHP (Laravel framework), MySQL, and more, guided by use case and system design diagrams for efficient architecture.

Result: The developed platform facilitates blood donor registration, simplifies search by location and blood group, and enhances communication through a user-friendly interface.

Conclusion: The system reduces delays in emergencies by improving access to blood, increasing the efficiency of donation services.

Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable
donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper
presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register
their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and
availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,
and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

*Timothee Robert,MohammadAli Shaeri,Mahsa Shoaran*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiND, a two-stage model for decoding bimanual movements from neural data, outperforming existing models in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty of decoding bimanual hand movements for BCIs due to overlapping neural signals and nonlinear interactions.

Method: BiND classifies motion types (unimanual left, right, or bimanual) and uses GRU-based decoders with a temporal index to predict hand velocities.

Result: BiND achieved higher prediction accuracy ($R^2$ of 0.76 for unimanual and 0.69 for bimanual) and better session robustness compared to six state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling make BiND an effective tool for improving bimanual hand movement decoding in BCIs.

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

*Pedro Carvalho,Bernd Ulmann,Wolf Singer,Felix Effenberger*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates implementing Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent Networks (HORNs) in low-energy analog-electronic hardware, showing that such systems preserve computational performance by retraining the readout layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore energy-efficient analog systems enabling oscillatory neural networks to exploit transient dynamics for computation, addressing the lack of implementations in analog-hardware settings.

Method: The authors trained a four-node HORN digitally for MNIST classification, transferred its parameters to analog circuits, and analyzed the performance gap using error metrics and a re-trained linear readout.

Result: Analog systems preserved the dynamics of the digital model but had lower classification accuracy due to precision discrepancies. Retraining the readout restored performance using analog dynamics.

Conclusion: Analog circuits can efficiently implement oscillatory networks, showing their feasibility for computation and energy-saving applications in neural data processing.

Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent
Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed,
and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet,
while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor
dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in
analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far
are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in
analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of
the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node
HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained
parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error
metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the
dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall
well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on
the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement
with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch
is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the
floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform
classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a
re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to
that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the
analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic
circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation,
providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit
brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.

*Mauricio Girardi-Schappo,Leonard Maler,André Longtin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how recurrently connected neuron populations encode information, introducing a dual-coding scheme (variance and rate coding) for improving information transmission, especially with weak stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of firing rate coding in reliably encoding weak stimuli in recurrent neuron networks.

Method: The researchers analyzed stochastic recurrent excitable networks near their critical points, focusing on single-cell threshold adaptation, to uncover the mechanisms underlying improved encoding strategies.

Result: They discovered that a dual-coding scheme (based on firing rate variance and rate coding) enhances mutual information transmission, especially for weak signals, while maintaining robustness across various parameters.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of threshold adaptation and near-critical dynamics for effective information encoding, with potential implications in both biological and artificial neural systems.

Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception
and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are
often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes
unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be
transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial
coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic
recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme,
enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance
coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs,
thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust
across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of
internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are
linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits
(~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at
criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable
encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a
fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual
coding in biological and artificial neural networks.

### [273] [Energy-Weighted Flow Matching: Unlocking Continuous Normalizing Flows for Efficient and Scalable Boltzmann Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03726)
*Niclas Dern,Lennart Redl,Sebastian Pfister,Marcel Kollovieh,David Lüdke,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a training method using energy evaluations to sample from complex, unnormalized distributions efficiently, addressing computational challenges with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from unnormalized distributions, such as Boltzmann distributions, is crucial for scientific applications but is computationally difficult due to their complex energy landscapes.

Method: EWFM reformulates conditional flow matching using importance sampling and two algorithms are proposed: iterative EWFM (iEWFM) and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), utilizing energy evaluations and temperature annealing.

Result: On benchmark systems, EWFM demonstrated competitive sampling performance with state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing energy evaluations.

Conclusion: Energy-Weighted Flow Matching enables efficient modeling of Boltzmann distributions using generative approaches, addressing computational inefficiencies of prior methods.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions
$\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many
scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex,
high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern
generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of
samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy
evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of
advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown
promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce
Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling
continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy
function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via
importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal
distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative
EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training,
and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature
annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including
challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate
sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while
requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces four new methods for testing relationships between node-level features and network structure, aiming at enhanced computation and fewer assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of determining correlations between node-level covariates and network structure, which is common in network-based applications.

Method: Four methods are developed: two based on a linear model linking node features to latent variables driving network structure, and two using canonical correlation analysis, avoiding linear model assumptions.

Result: All four methods have theoretical guarantees under low-rank latent space models and demonstrate improved computational efficiency and performance in tests on simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are more computationally efficient and robust, with fewer modeling assumptions, making them valuable for network dependency testing in various application scenarios.

Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features.
In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates
are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel
methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model
relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive
network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation
analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear
modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods
when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space
model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be
high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer
modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We
demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated
and real-world data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper merges compressed sensing and diffusion models to enhance inference efficiency in synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to accelerate diffusion model inference by integrating dimension reduction via compressed sensing.

Method: The method involves compressing data into a latent space, training diffusion models there, and using compressed sensing algorithms for sample recovery.

Result: The proposed approach shows faster convergence under sparsity assumptions and identifies an optimal latent space dimension.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments validate the method's utility across diverse datasets, making it effective for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach using triangular normalizing flows for Bayesian inverse problems, enabling generative modeling for likelihood simulation and posterior inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Bayesian inverse problems by developing a generative model capable of both simulating the likelihood and performing posterior inference efficiently.

Method: Utilizes triangular normalizing flows to create an invertible mapping for both conditional sampling and inference, and proposes a training loss for the generative model.

Result: Demonstrates the functionality of the presented generative modeling approach through numerical examples on stylized problems.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows potential for improving conditional generative modeling in Bayesian frameworks, combining efficient simulation and inference.

Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.

*Jung-hun Kim,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bandit framework for stochastic matching using the MNL model, achieving efficiency with minimal regret and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matching tasks with uncertain preferences are crucial in applications such as online platforms, but current solutions face high computational challenges.

Method: The study proposes batched algorithms to solve matching problems efficiently, reducing computational costs to O(1) while maintaining optimal regret bounds.

Result: The introduced algorithms achieve a regret bound of \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) and significantly lower computational cost compared to naive approaches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances computational efficiency and decision-making quality in stochastic matching scenarios.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching
based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents
on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm
stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown
preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize
regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all
agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based
on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur
a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we
propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates,
thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per
round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Method: The paper highlights equivalences and intrinsic connections between reinforcement learning techniques with human and internal feedback, test-time scaling methods, and diffusion guidance. It introduces resampling as an alternative approach for alignment and optimization in diffusion models.

Result: It establishes theoretical links among several post-training methods and provides a novel resampling technique for diffusion models that bypasses explicit use of reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study offers a clearer understanding of relationships among post-training techniques and presents resampling as a simpler alternative for diffusion model optimization.

Abstract: In this note, we reflect on several fundamental connections among widely used

sampling), while also illuminating intrinsic links between diffusion guidance

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges and inefficiencies posed by traditional forward modeling in studying exoplanetary atmospheres.

Method: The researchers present a framework employing QELMs, focusing on fault tolerance and utilizing near-term quantum devices like IBM Fez.

Result: The QELM architecture demonstrates its capability for analyzing astrophysical datasets and highlights the potential of quantum computing in this domain.

Conclusion: QELMs can advance the study of exoplanetary atmospheres by providing faster, more efficient, and precise computational methods, leveraging emerging quantum technologies.

Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.

*Zheng-Meng Zhai,Valerio Lucarini,Ying-Cheng Lai*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: Sparse optimization methods are commonly used to derive governing equations for dynamical systems from data, but in chaotic systems with imperfect data, models generated can vary in sensitivity while producing indistinguishable chaotic attractors, questioning the reliability of equation-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue with determining governing equations of chaotic systems from noisy or imperfect data, emphasizing the potential limitations of conventional equation-based modeling in such scenarios.

Method: The authors use sparse-optimization methods to derive governing equations for chaotic systems and evaluate their sensitivity through calculated differences in Koopman spectra, particularly observing discrepancies in small eigenvalues.

Result: They observe that various sparse-optimization-derived models for chaotic systems show sensitivity to the measurement process but lead to virtually identical chaotic attractors. Discrepancies appear in Koopman spectra for smaller eigenvalues.

Conclusion: The study concludes that equation-based modeling for chaotic systems with noisy data may lead to misleading physical interpretations, suggesting a preference for direct data modeling approaches such as machine learning methods.

Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a
popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering
the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and
measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used
sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models
that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models
generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking
limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling
in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the
different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the
differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an
equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing
equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to
misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the
available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how transparency, user control, and robot proactivity influence users' privacy perceptions when social robots handle sensitive information. The study found user control to be the most significant factor in fostering trust and privacy appropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors, such as transparency, user control, and robot behavior, that influence privacy perceptions when users interact with social robots in coaching contexts.

Method: Conducted an online study with 200 participants, examining the effects of transparency, user control, and robot proactivity on perceived privacy appropriateness and trust.

Result: Users preferred having explicit control over how their personal information is interpreted and shared, leading to higher trust and privacy appropriateness ratings. Transparency and proactivity alone showed minimal effects.

Conclusion: User control over information use is critical for fostering privacy and trust in social robots, and merely offering transparency or proactive behaviors is inadequate without control mechanisms.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates a gaze-based learning analytics dashboard to make eye-tracking data more accessible in education, particularly for English Language Arts (ELA). It includes visualizations and an LLM-powered conversational agent to support understanding and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underutilization of eye-tracking in educational technology due to challenges in interpreting and accessing this data, while exploring its potential benefits for teachers.

Method: The paper used an iterative design approach involving five studies with teachers and students. They applied user-centered design and data storytelling principles to create the dashboard, including familiar visualizations and a conversational agent.

Result: The findings highlight that gaze analytics is approachable and pedagogically useful with proper support, such as layered explanations and narrative scaffolds. The LLM-based conversational agent reduced cognitive barriers using natural language interactions.

Conclusion: Integrating novel data like gaze analytics in future EdTech systems is viable, especially when supported by user-friendly designs like familiar visualizations and conversational agents to assist in data interpretation.

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large
language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by
enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

### [284] [Unobtrusive In-Situ Measurement of Behavior Change by Deep Metric Similarity Learning of Motion Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04174)
*Christian Merz,Lukas Schach,Marie Luisa Fiedler,Jean-Luc Lugrin,Carolin Wienrich,Marc Erich Latoschik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biometric model utilizing deep metric similarity learning to detect user behavior changes in XR systems caused by avatar changes, showing its advantages over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how avatars influence behavior in XR environments, focusing specifically on unobtrusively identifying behavior changes related to the Proteus effect or bodily affordances.

Method: Developing a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, comparing it with non-learned motion analysis and subjective questionnaires. Empirical evaluation involved a within-subjects study where users embodied avatars of different heights and performed a task.

Result: The similarity learning model outperformed alternative methods, successfully identifying behavior changes based on motion data during avatar alterations across various conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables unobtrusive, scalable, and real-time user-specific analysis of behavior changes in XR caused by avatar modifications, offering significant advantages over traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

*Georgios Makridis,Georgios Fragiadakis,Jorge Oliveira,Tomaz Saraiva,Philip Mavrepis,Georgios Fatouros,Dimosthenis Kyriazis*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces HumAIne-chatbot, an AI chatbot that personalizes interactions by profiling users and adapting its responses in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational AI often fails to cater to individual user characteristics and lacks adaptive dialogue management, leading to generic user interactions.

Method: The chatbot utilizes a pre-trained framework on GPT-generated personas and refines user profiles through online reinforcement learning, combining implicit and explicit user feedback to tailor dialogue policy.

Result: In experiments with 50 synthetic personas, the personalized chatbot significantly outperformed non-personalized versions in user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement, with statistically significant improvements.

Conclusion: AI-driven user profiling and dynamic personalization effectively enhance conversational AI and warrant further real-world testing.

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.

### [286] [Avoidance of an unexpected obstacle without reinforcement learning: Why not using advanced control-theoretic tools?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03721)
*Cédric Join,Michel Fliess*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents collision avoidance techniques for unexpected obstacles using flatness-based control and model-free predictive control as alternatives to reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating satisfactory robustness and low computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by criticisms of RL, specifically its inefficiency due to a need for an excessive number of trials to learn tasks.

Method: The authors use the Dubins' car model and implement two methods: flatness-based control with HEOL feedback, and a model-free predictive control approach.

Result: Computer experiments show that both methods perform convincingly, with model-based slightly outperforming model-free. Both methods demonstrate robust performance against mismatches and disturbances, with the model-free approach excelling in this aspect.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are reliable, robust, and computationally efficient alternatives to RL for collision avoidance in scenarios involving unexpected obstacles.

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

*Max H. Cohen,Eugene Lavretsky,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for controlling nonlinear systems under multiple state constraints using multiple control barrier functions (CBFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for handling multiple state constraints in nonlinear systems using CBFs, as most previous works focus on single CBF constraints.

Method: The paper develops a framework for box constraints on vector-valued outputs of systems with vector relative degree, ensuring compatibility of CBF constraints and formulating an optimization-based controller.

Result: The proposed controller is locally Lipschitz continuous, has a closed-form expression, and addresses nominal tracking degradation due to safety constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework for control of nonlinear systems under multiple CBF constraints is effective, as demonstrated by simulations on a planar quadrotor.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

### [288] [Leveraging Equivariances and Symmetries in the Control Barrier Function Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04399)
*Adrian Wiltz,Dimos V. Dimarogonas*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of system dynamics equivariances (symmetries) to simplify the synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), providing computational efficiencies and flexibility for non-symmetric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational or manual effort required in the construction of CBFs by exploiting the inherent symmetry (equivariances) in system dynamics and constraints.

Method: The authors leverage equivariances in system dynamics and symmetries in constraints to derive symmetries in CBFs. They use these insights to infer CBF values across domains and construct CBFs for non-symmetric constraints using partially known CBFs.

Result: The paper demonstrates significant computational savings in CBF synthesis and highlights flexibility, particularly for systems with non-symmetric constraints. Examples and numerical studies validate the theoretical approach.

Conclusion: Equivariances in system dynamics and constraints can be used to simplify and improve the efficiency of CBF synthesis, offering practical benefits for various control scenarios.

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

*Babak Esmaeili,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven motion-planning framework for linear multi-agent systems in obstacle-filled environments, leveraging invariant ellipsoids from experimental data for safe trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a motion-planning system for multi-agent systems that can ensure safety in complex, shared workspaces without relying on explicit system models.

Method: Agents independently solve semidefinite programs to learn closed-loop behavior, generating invariant ellipsoids for safe transition regions. A sampling-based planner coordinates these transitions through tree expansion and a space-time reservation table.

Result: The proposed framework synthesizes synchronized and safe trajectories for multiple agents, using only data and convex optimization tools, as validated through simulation results.

Conclusion: The system provides dynamically feasible and provably safe trajectories for multi-agent operations using data-driven optimization methods, ensuring safety in shared environments without explicit dynamics models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

TL;DR: This paper introduces integrating Echo-State Networks (ESNs) and Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control for fast identification and control of nonlinear dynamics, showcasing improved performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address central challenges of online identification and control of unknown nonlinear dynamics, leveraging the advanced capabilities of neural networks.

Method: The method integrates ESNs for nonlinear dynamics learning and MPPI for control, alongside an uncertainty-aware extension (URPPI) to balance exploration and exploitation during learning.

Result: Experimental results show URPPI reduced control costs by up to 60%, confirming improved control performance over traditional methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating ESNs with MPPI offers a significant advancement in efficiently learning and controlling nonlinear dynamic systems, particularly under uncertainty.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

*Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti,Andrea Del Prete*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper discusses a method to simplify and verify the computation of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) used in safety certification of dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of computing Control Barrier Functions, which involves tackling a complex and generally intractable robust optimization problem.

Method: The authors propose a verification method using Lipschitz arguments to ensure CBFs comply with robust constraints, reducing computational complexity. They also design a sample-efficient certification algorithm.

Result: The verification method and certification algorithm were validated through a numerical example, demonstrating their efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies computing CBFs and ensures compliance with robust constraints, while being computationally efficient and sample-efficient.

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the FM-UKF, which integrates transformer-based dynamics models with known sensor models for zero-shot state estimation, showing competitive performance and generalization without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the manual system identification and data collection effort traditionally required for state estimation in control, inspired by the potential of foundation models to generalize across tasks with minimal data.

Method: The paper combines transformer-based dynamics foundation models with analytically derived sensor models through the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), achieving zero-shot performance without retraining for new conditions.

Result: FM-UKF demonstrated competitive accuracy and robust performance on a benchmark of container ship models with complex dynamics compared to classical methods and end-to-end approaches.

Conclusion: FM-UKF exhibits promising capabilities in generalizing across varying dynamics and sensor configurations, and it reduces the need for extensive retraining. Open-sourcing a benchmark further supports future work.

Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires
extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid control strategy using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and data-driven methods for optimizing Li-ion battery charging protocols, balancing speed and battery life.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between charging speed and battery ageing in Lithium-ion batteries, improving the efficiency and safety of Battery Management Systems (BMS).

Method: The proposed approach combines Reinforcement Learning for controller synthesis with data-driven formal methods to partition control strategies. A hybrid system is formed with discrete RL-controller selection and continuous battery dynamics.

Result: The method enables the design of charging protocols with probabilistic guarantees on battery performance, achieved through Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis and data-driven abstractions.

Conclusion: The study provides a viable strategy for designing data-driven charging protocols that improve battery performance while maintaining safety and prolonging lifespan.

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

*Harald Störrle,Anastasia Hort*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simpler, expert-driven model to predict operation durations using small datasets, achieving comparable or better results than complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High operating theater costs in hospitals drive the need for optimized surgery schedules to reduce costs and improve outcomes. However, existing methods require extensive data and are often too complex.

Method: The study leverages practitioner expertise and domain knowledge, combining factor analysis with regression models to predict surgery durations based on limited datasets.

Result: Simple methods of central tendency were found to be as effective, if not superior, to complex models proposed in past research, emphasizing the value of expert-driven, theory-guided data analysis.

Conclusion: Blending expert knowledge with data science can yield high-performing models even with small datasets, improving forecasting accuracy and making data analysis more accessible.

Abstract: Context: Utilization of operating theaters is a major cost driver in
hospitals. Optimizing this variable through optimized surgery schedules may
significantly lower cost and simultaneously improve medical outcomes. Previous
studies proposed various complex models to predict the duration of procedures,
the key ingredient to optimal schedules. They did so perusing large amounts of
data.
  Goals: We aspire to create an effective and efficient model to predict
operation durations based on only a small amount of data. Ideally, our model is
also simpler in structure, and thus easier to use.
  Methods: We immerse ourselves in the application domain to leverage
practitioners expertise. This way, we make the best use of our limited supply
of clinical data, and may conduct our data analysis in a theory-guided way. We
do a combined factor analysis and develop regression models to predict the
duration of the perioperative process.
  Findings: We found simple methods of central tendency to perform on a par
with much more complex methods proposed in the literature. In fact, they
sometimes outperform them. We conclude that combining expert knowledge with
data analysis may improve both data quality and model performance, allowing for
more accurate forecasts.
  Conclusion: We yield better results than previous researchers by integrating
conventional data science methods with qualitative studies of clinical settings
and process structure. Thus, we are able to leverage even small datasets.

TL;DR: The paper presents SAMVAD, a Multi-Agent System simulating judicial deliberation in the Indian justice system using LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced legal fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ethical and practical challenges of studying judicial panels by offering a simulation platform to analyze judicial reasoning and decision-making processes.

Method: SAMVAD leverages a Multi-Agent System with agents fulfilling judicial roles. It incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation to base arguments and decisions on landmark Indian legal documents, and the agents deliberate iteratively to reach a consensus.

Result: The paper showcases a platform for legally grounded, explainable simulations of judicial processes in the Indian context, highlighting its ability to generate detailed legal arguments and instructions.

Conclusion: SAMVAD stands as a useful tool for studying legal reasoning and group dynamics in a judicial setting, providing a transparent and configurable simulation environment grounded in Indian legal documents.

Abstract: Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)
designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the
Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

TL;DR: This paper uses machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data to detect antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns in Campylobacter species and forecast future trends and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the public health and economic challenges posed by increasing antibiotic resistance and forecast resistance trends for better planning.

Method: Machine learning, particularly Random Forest modeling validated with bootstrap resampling, is applied on genomic and epidemiological data integrated with economic projections. Time-series forecasting methods like SARIMA, SIR, and Prophet are also employed.

Result: The study identifies resistance determinants, achieves a 74% accuracy for AMR prediction, and forecasts an increased economic burden exceeding 1.9 billion GBP by 2050.

Conclusion: Without intervention, AMR in Campylobacter species will rise, leading to significant healthcare and economic challenges. Improved predictive systems can help inform mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic
challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.
This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data
from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity
(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by
the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns
in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK
from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance
determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We
investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene
for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with
bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%
accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,
SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially

### [297] [Hypothesis Selection: A High Probability Conundrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03734)
*Anders Aamand,Maryam Aliakbarpour,Justin Y. Chen,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper improves the hypothesis selection algorithm, achieving faster time complexity ($\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$) and introduces advancements in three alternative settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unresolved issues in hypothesis selection, specifically optimal running time for algorithms with best sample complexity and approximation factor of 3.

Method: The study includes algorithmic improvements in runtime, optimal sample complexity for cases with known minimum distance ($\mathsf{OPT}$), expected distance bounds, and preprocessing steps.

Result: The authors improved previous results on time complexity and resolved several open questions related to approximation factor and preprocessing in hypothesis selection.

Conclusion: The paper significantly advances the field of hypothesis selection by optimizing time complexity, addressing open questions, and enhancing performance in specialized scenarios.

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given a finite set of candidate
distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples
from an unknown distribution $P$. Our goal is to find a hypothesis $H_i$ whose
total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis
in $\mathcal{H}$. If the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output
an $H_i$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation
distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$.
  Despite decades of work, key aspects of this problem remain unresolved,
including the optimal running time for algorithms that achieve the optimal
sample complexity and best possible approximation factor of $C=3$. The previous
state-of-the-art result [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided a
nearly linear in $n$ time algorithm but with a sub-optimal dependence on the
other parameters, running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We
improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$,
significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.
  Furthermore, we study hypothesis selection in three alternative settings,
resolving or making progress on several open questions from prior works. (1) We
settle the optimal approximation factor when bounding the \textit{expected
distance} of the output hypothesis, rather than its high-probability
performance. (2) Assuming the numerical value of \textit{$\mathsf{OPT}$ is
known} in advance, we present an algorithm obtaining $C=3$ and runtime
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ with the optimal sample complexity and succeeding
with high probability in $n$. (3) Allowing polynomial \textit{preprocessing}
step on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ before observing samples, we present
an algorithm with $C=3$ and subquadratic runtime which succeeds with high
probability in $n$.

### [298] [Finetuning AI Foundation Models to Develop Subgrid-Scale Parameterizations: A Case Study on Atmospheric Gravity Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03816)
*Aman Gupta,Aditi Sheshadri,Sujit Roy,Johannes Schmude,Vishal Gaur,Wei Ji Leong,Manil Maskey,Rahul Ramachandran*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to creating machine learning parameterizations for small-scale climate processes using a fine-tuned AI foundation model (FM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncertainty in global climate models caused by subgrid-scale processes like gravity waves and clouds, which are unresolved; and to explore the utilization of AI foundation models in climate research.

Method: A pre-trained AI foundation model (Prithvi WxC) with 2.3 billion parameters was fine-tuned to develop a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves. It analyzed atmospheric evolution using data with 10 times finer resolution and compared performance against a baseline model.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed a baseline (Attention U-Net), achieving superior predictive accuracy as quantified by a reduced Hellinger distance (0.11 vs 0.06). It was consistent even in regions not included during the pre-training phase.

Conclusion: Foundation models (FMs) show high versatility and reusability, offering potential for more accurate, physically grounded parameterizations of climate and earth-system processes.

Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes
like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be
sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes
are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to
developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes
by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely
unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3
billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a
latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned
(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity
waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution
climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10
times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous
evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals
superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the
atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost
is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and
0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and
reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-
and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of
observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more
earth-system processes.

*Junyu Lu,Di Jiang,Mengze Hong,Victor Junqiu Wei,Qintian Guo,Zhiyang Su*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Contextualized Token Discrimination" (CTD) for improving speech query correction in ASR systems using BERT-based token representations and achieves superior performance on a new benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for accurate speech query correction due to the rise in popularity of speech-based search through ASR systems.

Method: CTD uses BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations, enhances semantic information via a composition layer, and corrects tokens by analyzing the discrepancy between original and contextualized token representations.

Result: CTD demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics and introduces a benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions for audio query correction.

Conclusion: The CTD method effectively improves speech query correction and provides a robust benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

### [300] [AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04345)
*Qizhou Wang,Hanxun Huang,Guansong Pang,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces AUDETER, a diversified, large-scale deepfake audio dataset to improve generalization and robustness in deepfake detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake audio datasets fail to address real-world diversity and evolving synthesis technologies, leading to unreliable detection methods in practical applications.

Method: The authors created AUDETER, a dataset containing 3 million synthetic audio clips (~4,500 hours) generated by 11 TTS models and 10 vocoders, enabling thorough evaluation and model training.

Result: State-of-the-art detection methods trained on AUDETER significantly improved generalization, reducing detection error rates by 44.1% to 51.6%, and achieving an error rate of just 4.17% on cross-domain samples.

Conclusion: AUDETER advances deepfake audio detection by addressing domain shifts, enabling the development of generalist detectors for real-world scenarios, and is publicly available for the research community.

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.
AUDETER is available on GitHub.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a neural network-based approach to enhance PDE solving accuracy and scalability, leveraging subdomain models and iterative algorithms for large-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in achieving high accuracy and scalability in PDE solving using neural networks.

Method: The authors propose a subdomain neural operator model with Robin-type boundary conditions and utilize it as a preconditioner within iterative multilevel domain decomposition.

Result: The model effectively solves large-scale PDE problems, including Maxwell's equations, and demonstrates utility in inverse design applications.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise in developing accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for complex and large-scale problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate
and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

### [302] [COBRA: Multimodal Sensing Deep Learning Framework for Remote Chronic Obesity Management via Wrist-Worn Activity Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04210)
*Zhengyang Shen,Bo Gao,Mayue Shi*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: COBRA is a deep learning framework using wrist-worn sensors to monitor behaviors critical in managing obesity, achieving high accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-reported methods of behavioral monitoring in obesity management are prone to significant inaccuracies, including underreporting and recall bias, and lack effective integration with digital health systems.

Method: The researchers introduced COBRA, a deep learning framework featuring a hybrid D-Net architecture. D-Net combines U-Net for spatial modeling, multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM for temporal processing to classify user activities relevant to obesity management into four categories, leveraging wrist-worn multimodal sensors.

Result: COBRA achieved 96.86% accuracy with F1-scores of over 94% for all categories (Physical Activity, Food Intake, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living) on the WISDM-Smart dataset. It outperformed existing methods by 1.18% in accuracy and showed robust generalizability across demographics.

Conclusion: COBRA provides an objective, scalable, and accurate approach to continuous obesity behavior monitoring, addressing traditional method limitations and showing potential for broad deployment in personalized obesity treatments.

Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance
behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant
underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern
digital health systems. This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral
Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective
behavioral monitoring using wrist-worn multimodal sensors. COBRA integrates a
hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head
self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily
activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical
Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart
dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal
preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving
high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86%
overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical
Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily
Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The
framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%),
enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and
continuous lifestyle monitoring.

*Haoyu Jiang,Yuexi Wang,Yun Yang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel simulation-based inference (SBI) method combining score matching and Langevin dynamics, which operates efficiently in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SBI methods often struggle with moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces despite advances from deep generative models and Approximate Bayesian Computation. The paper aimed to address these challenges by leveraging successful techniques from gradient-based Monte Carlo methods.

Method: The authors proposed integrating score matching with Langevin dynamics for SBI. Key innovations include tailored score-matching procedures with localization schemes to reduce simulation costs and architectural regularization to improve score accuracy.

Result: The method demonstrated theoretical robustness and favorable performance on benchmark and challenging high-dimensional tasks, outperforming existing SBI approaches.

Conclusion: The novel combination of score matching and Langevin dynamics expands the capabilities of SBI in handling more complex posterior landscapes efficiently.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the
likelihood is intractable but model simulations are available. Recent advances
in statistics and machine learning, including Approximate Bayesian Computation
and deep generative models, have expanded the applicability of SBI, yet these
methods often face challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian
sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with
Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in
such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for
SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an
architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of
log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide
theoretical analysis of the method and illustrate its practical benefits on
benchmark tasks and on more challenging problems in moderate to high
dimensions, where it performs favorably compared to existing approaches.

### [304] [We Have It Covered: A Resampling-based Method for Uplift Model Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04315)

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of comparing uplift models under uncertainty by introducing a resampling-based approach and a new sampling procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid in modern marketing strategies by improving uplift model evaluation and comparison, particularly when traditional methods become unfeasible due to population constraints.

Method: The authors propose a two-step sampling procedure combined with a resampling-based approach to evaluate and compare uplift models under uncertainty.

Result: Simulations and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in estimating and comparing uplift curves.

Conclusion: The research highlights a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in uplift model evaluation, filling a gap in existing methodologies.

Abstract: Uplift models play a critical role in modern marketing applications to help
understand the incremental benefits of interventions and identify optimal
targeting strategies. A variety of techniques exist for building uplift models,
and it is essential to understand the model differences in the context of
intended applications. The uplift curve is a widely adopted tool for assessing
uplift model performance on the selection universe when observations are
available for the entire population. However, when it is uneconomical or
infeasible to select the entire population, it becomes difficult or even
impossible to estimate the uplift curve without appropriate sampling design. To
the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed uncertainty
quantification of uplift curve estimates, which is essential for model
comparisons. We propose a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based
approach to compare uplift models with uncertainty quantification, examine the
proposed method via simulations and real data applications, and conclude with a
discussion.

### [305] [How many patients could we save with LLM priors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04250)
*Shota Arai,David Selby,Andrew Vargo,Sebastian Vollmer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to inform Bayesian modeling in clinical trials, aiming to reduce the number of patients needed while maintaining statistical power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make clinical trials more efficient by leveraging external knowledge encoded in large language models, thereby minimizing the patient enrollment needed for robust statistical analysis.

Method: The proposed approach uses hierarchical Bayesian modeling with LLM-informed prior distributions, rather than synthetic data, to incorporate external clinical expertise into safety assessments. The priors for hyperparameters are elicited directly from pre-trained LLMs.

Result: The study demonstrates through sensitivity analysis and real-world trial data evaluation that LLM-informed priors significantly enhance predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical methods.

Conclusion: The methodology enables substantial reductions in required trial participants, improves safety assessments, and could potentially revolutionize drug safety monitoring and regulatory practices.

Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the
same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language
models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling
of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed
prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate
synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from
the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for
hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM,
enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into
Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity
analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we
demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance
compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the
way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling
substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust
safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring
and regulatory decision making.

*Marina Struleva,Shayan Hundrieser,Dominic Schuhmacher,Axel Munk*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper examines statistical behavior and convergence rates of empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) between spatio-temporal point processes, addressing assumptions about variance growth and intrinsic dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing interest in utilizing optimal transport methods in settings involving spatio-temporal point processes, and a gap exists in understanding statistical properties and convergence rates in such contexts.

Method: The authors model observations as arising from two weakly time-stationary point processes over expanding time windows, relying on assumptions about temporal variance growth to study convergence properties.

Result: Sharp convergence rates were established for the empirical UOT distance in terms of intrinsic dimensions under sub-quadratic variance growth assumptions. Additionally, matching lower bounds were provided to establish near minimax rate optimality.

Conclusion: The paper characterizes empirical UOT estimators for spatio-temporal point processes, providing theoretical bounds and showing near-optimal statistical properties under certain conditions.

Abstract: We statistically analyze empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal
transport (UOT) formalisms, focusing on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance,
between general intensity measures based on observations from spatio-temporal
point processes. Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly
time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish
sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic
dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition
of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal
dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes
slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial
covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes,
including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox
processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower
bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish
near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic model for identifying social media echo chambers by including individual confirmation bias into the gravity well framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in existing models that neglect the influence of individual confirmation biases in the formation of social media echo chambers.

Method: They extended the gravity well model by incorporating a dynamic confirmation bias variable, calculated for each user based on their posting and response histories.

Result: Their model was tested and validated on nineteen Reddit communities, showing improved detection of echo chambers and revealing markers for information health.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic identification of echo chambers influenced by confirmation bias, aiding efforts to curb misinformation spread.

Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of
misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual
confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well"
model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells.
We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias
variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to
belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through
comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a
wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity
well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals
community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on
nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of
confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective
identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the
model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common
points of amplification.

*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study examines how AI systems with race-based biases influence human hiring decisions, showing that humans tend to align their choices with the AI's biased preferences and highlighting strategies to mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI systems can skew human decision-making behavior in collaborative tasks, particularly in hiring, and to investigate the effectiveness of potential bias-mitigation strategies.

Method: The study involved a resume-screening experiment with 528 participants across 1,526 hiring scenarios using simulated AI models with race-based preferences. Implicit association tests (IATs) were conducted to measure unconscious associations.

Result: Participants aligned their choices with AI's racial preferences up to 90% of the time, and completing IATs beforehand boosted the likelihood of selecting counter-stereotypical candidates by 13%. Decisions remained vulnerable to AI bias even if participants perceived AI recommendations as low quality.

Conclusion: AI systems in human-in-the-loop scenarios significantly impact human decisions, emphasizing the need for organizational policies, user education, and regulatory oversight to address the interplay between human autonomy and biased AI systems.

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

Motivation: Understanding how Bayesian agents with different generative models can align their latent variables is crucial for interoperability in collaborative settings.

Method: The authors propose the 'natural latent conditions' as a framework for translating latent variables, supported by theoretical robustness to approximation errors.

Result: The study provides simple, general, and robust conditions under which latent variable translatability is guaranteed.

Conclusion: Natural latent conditions offer a foundational yet flexible approach for translating latent variables between Bayesian models, with practical implications for collaboration and shared understanding.

Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same
environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive
distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but
may have different generative models containing different latent variables.
Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function
of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be
possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further
constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability
is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to
approximation error in the natural latent conditions.

### [312] [An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03539)
*Chatipat Lorpaiboon,Jonathan Weare,Aaron R. Dinner*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to estimate the committor for transitions between two stable states, addressing biases caused by the lag time in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of biased committor and transition rate estimates in existing methods caused by their dependence on lag time.

Method: The authors present an alternative expression for the transition rate that is minimized by the exact committor regardless of lag time, testing its robustness numerically on benchmark systems.

Result: Numerical evaluations show that the proposed method produces committor and transition rate estimates less sensitive to lag time variations compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The new approach improves the accuracy of committor and transition rate predictions, offering robustness against lag time selection along with additional connections to variational frameworks.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

*Guglielmo Gattiglio,Lyudmila Grigoryeva,Massimiliano Tamborrino*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic version of the GParareal algorithm, enabling uncertainty quantification in solving differential equations parallel-in-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the lack of uncertainty quantification in parallel-in-time (PinT) solutions of differential equations, which has been a critical gap in these computational methods.

Method: The proposed Prob-GParareal uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model corrections in the Parareal algorithm. Theoretical analysis of computational complexity and error bounds supports the approach, while numerical validations are conducted with benchmark problems.

Result: The method demonstrated accuracy and robustness in five ODE benchmarks, including challenging chaotic and stiff systems. It also showed scalability and improved performance through a variant, Prob-nnGParareal, which replaced GPs with nearest-neighbor GPs.

Conclusion: Prob-GParareal successfully integrates uncertainty quantification into PinT solutions, offering a probabilistic framework that is compatible with existing methods and scalable for complex problems.

Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal
algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the
Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential
equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model
the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the
propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic
forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates
probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical
numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing
Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the
computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we
numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm
on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation
problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed
algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing
the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased
performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in
the development of probabilistic counterparts to established PinT methods.

*Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Yiming Wang,Semih Esenlik,Zhaobin Zhang,Kai Zhang,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates enhancement filtering in neural video compression, introducing methods to reduce bit rate and improve codec performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural video compression efficiency using systematic filtering techniques.

Method: The study uses in-loop contextual filtering with adaptive coding strategies, and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement for improved video quality.

Result: The proposed methods achieve a 7.71% bit rate reduction compared to top neural video codecs.

Conclusion: The enhancement filtering techniques improve coding efficiency and quality, marking a substantial advancement in neural video compression.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Junqi Liao,Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Zhipin Deng,Li Li,Dong Liu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHVC, a novel neural video codec that addresses mismatches and inefficiencies in reference and quality structures to surpass state-of-the-art neural video codec performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural video codecs exhibit significant efficiency improvements over traditional video codecs, but the design of reference and hierarchical quality structures within NVCs has room for optimization.

Method: The approach involves three innovations: a hierarchical multi-reference scheme aligning reference and quality structures, a lookahead strategy using encoder-side future frame context, and a layer-wise random quality training strategy to stabilize inference quality.

Result: The proposed EHVC achieves performance significantly superior to existing state-of-the-art neural video codecs.

Conclusion: EHVC enhances neural video codec efficiency through its alignment and stabilization strategies, contributing to advancements in video compression. Code will be made publicly available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code

### [316] [Error Detection Schemes for Barrett Reduction of CT-BU on FPGA in Post Quantum Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04070)
*Paresh Baidya,Rourab Paul,Vikas Srivastava,Sumit Kumar Debnath*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the risk of fault injection in hardware implementations of Post-Quantum Cryptographic algorithms, specifically targeting Kyber's Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU). It proposes three recomputation-based fault detection methods: RENO, RESO, and a new efficient method, RESWO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address vulnerabilities in hardware implementations of Post-Quantum Cryptographic algorithms, where intentional fault injections can compromise security and leak sensitive information.

Method: Three fault detection methods for Barrett Reduction in Kyber's CT-BU hardware were investigated: the existing RENO and RESO methods, alongside the newly proposed RESWO algorithm. All methods are recomputation-based, and RESWO uniquely uses swapped operands to detect faults.

Result: The RESWO algorithm demonstrated lesser delay while consuming similar hardware resources (slices) compared to RENO and RESO. All three methods achieved fault detection efficiency nearing 100%.

Conclusion: The proposed RESWO method provides efficient and lightweight fault detection for Barrett Reduction in hardware implementations of Kyber, reducing vulnerability to intentional fault injections without increasing resource consumption.

Abstract: A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally
injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)
algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in
side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The
recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also
leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three
efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for
Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are
fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including
Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new
algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection.
While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted
Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett
Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices
compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both
RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is
nearly 100%.

### [317] [Reactive Bottom-Up Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03711)
*Siddharth Muralee,Sourag Cherupattamoolayil,James C. Davis,Antonio Bianchi,Aravind Machiry*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reactive Bottom-Up Testing, addressing limitations in vulnerability detection, and demonstrates its strengths using a tool named Griller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional and recent Bottom-Up dynamic testing methods in detecting deep-call graph functions' vulnerabilities while minimizing false positives.

Method: Reactive Bottom-Up Testing, a three-stage method: 1) type/context-aware harness generation for functions, 2) fuzzing combined with symbolic execution to find crashes and extract constraints, 3) verifying crashes using combined input constraints.

Result: Implemented as "Griller," successfully detecting 28 known vulnerabilities in 5 open-source projects and uncovering 6 new vulnerabilities in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Reactive Bottom-Up Testing substantially improves vulnerability detection in complex systems, offering a more systematic vulnerability validation process within program contexts.

Abstract: Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers
apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most
common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a
top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the
call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address
these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating
valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.
  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up
Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not
sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is
a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also
validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that
detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a
three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions
and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and
extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by
combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated
prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting
using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,
where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we
evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it
discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that
Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of
vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security
practices.

*Junhui Li,Chengbin Feng,Zhiwei Yang,Qi Mo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces BIDO, a hybrid image-based malware detector addressing robustness issues against obfuscation and concept drift, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the mutual issue of out-of-distribution challenges posed by obfuscation and concept drift, which degrade image-based malware detectors.

Method: It uses local feature selection for discriminative power, models cross-modal dependencies for feature robustness, and employs a learnable metric for feature compactness.

Result: BIDO significantly outperforms baselines in experiments, proving higher robustness against obfuscation and concept drift.

Conclusion: By addressing the common statistical root and introducing novel methods, BIDO enhances malware detection robustness and scalability.

Abstract: To identify malicious Android applications, various malware detection
techniques have been proposed. Among them, image-based approaches are
considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability.
Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant
performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift.
However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different
problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact
that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and
research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a
hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both
obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the
discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection
module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to
enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an
outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns.
Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls
samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different
labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on
the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms
existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and
obfuscation. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study introduces NeuroBreak, a system for analyzing large language models' neuron-level safety mechanisms to combat jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing security vulnerabilities in LLMs due to adversarial jailbreak attacks and the challenge of understanding these mechanisms internally.

Method: NeuroBreak employs layer-wise representation probing analysis and explores critical neurons from semantic and functional perspectives, providing in-depth insights into the decision-making processes of LLMs.

Result: The system analyzes various jailbreak attack methods, successfully verifies its effectiveness through quantitative evaluation and case studies, and provides insights into defense strategies.

Conclusion: NeuroBreak offers mechanistic insights that pave the way for developing advanced defense mechanisms against jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving
jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework for Ethereum fraud detection, enhancing performance via fusion of linguistic, graph, and expert data representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ethereum fraud detection lacks semantic understanding of transactions, suffers from homogeneity issues, and faces scalability challenges in self-supervised learning.

Method: The authors propose TxCLM for transforming numerical transactions into linguistic representations, MAGAE for scalable graph learning, and a fusion network to integrate account representations.

Result: LMAE4Eth outperformed 21 baseline methods in fraud detection across three datasets, exceeding the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two datasets.

Conclusion: LMAE4Eth effectively addresses semantic learning, representation discrimination, and scalability, improving Ethereum fraud detection.

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces KubeGuard, a framework for enhancing Kubernetes security by refining overly permissive configurations through runtime logs and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes environments face significant security risks due to misconfigured and overly permissive resources, which can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

Method: KubeGuard uses a runtime log-driven approach with modular prompt-chaining workflows to create and refine Kubernetes manifests. It leverages large language models to analyze both manifests and runtime logs.

Result: KubeGuard demonstrated effectiveness in generating and refining Kubernetes manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: KubeGuard provides actionable, least-privilege configuration recommendations, enhancing Kubernetes security and mitigating risks associated with permissive configurations.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Cosserat rod model for real-time simulation, achieving significant speed-ups compared to CPU versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the computational performance of simulating non-linear elastic rods, which are used in applications like threads, surgical instruments, and catheters.

Method: A massively-parallel GPU implementation of the CoRdE model and its inextensible variant using CUDA, inter-block synchronization, and optimized kernel launches.

Result: The GPU implementation achieved speed-ups of x40 for the extensible CoRdE model and x15.11 for the inextensible variant over CPU versions. Real-time performance was demonstrated in a cardiovascular catheter simulation.

Conclusion: The GPU-accelerated approach enables efficient, accurate, and real-time simulation of elastic rods, making it suitable for interactive applications.

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper presents LuxDiT, a video diffusion transformer model for estimating high-dynamic-range (HDR) lighting from single images or videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lighting estimation from single images or videos is challenging because of limited ground-truth HDR environment maps and the complexity of inferring global context from indirect cues.

Method: The authors propose LuxDiT, which fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer on a synthetic lighting dataset. Additionally, they use a low-rank adaptation finetuning strategy on a collected HDR panorama dataset to improve semantic alignment.

Result: LuxDiT produces accurate HDR lighting predictions, capturing angular high-frequency details, and outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes well to real-world scenes and effectively addresses lighting estimation challenges, representing a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

*Sankeerth Durvasula,Sharanshangar Muhunthan,Zain Moustafa,Richard Chen,Ruofan Liang,Yushi Guan,Nilesh Ahuja,Nilesh Jain,Selvakumar Panneer,Nandita Vijaykumar*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContraGS, a method to reduce GPU memory consumption during training of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations without compromising on quality, leveraging codebooks and Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the high GPU memory requirements and inefficiencies in training/rendering latencies caused by large 3D Gaussian counts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques.

Method: ContraGS utilizes codebooks for compact parameter storage and employs Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling to train models directly on compressed representations.

Result: ContraGS achieves an average 3.49X reduction in training memory usage, accelerates training by 1.36X and rendering by 1.88X, while maintaining close-to-state-of-art quality.

Conclusion: ContraGS is effective in enabling memory-efficient training of high-quality 3DGS models without significant loss of quality, addressing the challenges of compression and non-differentiable parameter optimization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

*Ashish Tiwari,Satyam Bhardwaj,Yash Bachwana,Parag Sarvoday Sahu,T. M. Feroz Ali,Bhargava Chintalapati,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic dataset using Fractal Perlin noise to model heterogeneous scattering parameters and proposes a method, TensoIS, to estimate these parameters from images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating heterogeneous media scattering parameters face challenges due to under-constrained modeling and lack of distribution frameworks; the paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors created a dataset (HeteroSynth) with scattering modeled by Fractal Perlin noise and developed Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS) leveraging learnable low-rank tensor components for parameter estimation.

Result: TensoIS demonstrated effectiveness on synthetic datasets, realistic volumetric simulations, and real-world samples for inverse scattering estimation.

Conclusion: The study highlights Perlin noise's potential for modeling real-world heterogeneous scattering and provides a feed-forward estimation framework adaptable to various real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

### [327] [SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04058)
*Lei Zhong,Yi Yang,Changjian Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The study introduces SMooGPT, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), to generate stylized motions through a novel reasoning, composition, and generation method in body-part text space, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stylized motion generation approaches face issues like low interpretability, limited control, bias toward specific motions (like walking), and poor generalization to new motion styles. The paper seeks to overcome these through a more interpretable and flexible method.

Method: The authors propose SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM that uses body-part text descriptions as an intermediate representation for reasoning, composing, and generating stylized motions. This method exploits the compositional nature of motion, natural language interpretability, and LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Result: SMooGPT achieves high interpretability, fine-grained control over motion, improved generalization to new motion styles through large vocabulary capabilities, and resolves conflicts between motion content and style effectively.

Conclusion: Using body-part text space and LLM reasoning, SMooGPT advances stylized motion generation with better control, flexibility, and generalization, proving its effectiveness through experiments and perceptual user studies.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

*Dongliang Cao,Guoxing Sun,Marc Habermann,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach that combines radiance field rendering and diffusion modeling to generate dynamic human avatars with high photorealism and pose-dependent deformations, addressing limitations of previous techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing human avatar generation methods, which either lack generalization across identities or fail to achieve photorealistic dynamic rendering.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage pipeline: first, optimizing person-specific UNets to capture pose-dependent deformations, and second, training a hyper diffusion model over these UNet weights to allow real-time, controllable rendering during inference.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates dynamic human avatars that outperform state-of-the-art techniques, as validated through a large-scale, multi-view video dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of person-specific rendering and diffusion modeling enables superior dynamic human avatar generation, achieving both photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces LibriQuote, a dataset aimed at improving expressive text-to-speech synthesis with 18K hours of speech data. It features benchmarks for evaluating expressive and natural speech synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems struggle with expressiveness due to unclear proportions of expressive data in large datasets and the limited scale of existing expressive corpora.

Method: The authors constructed LibriQuote, consisting of 12.7K hours of neutral speech and 5.3K hours of expressive speech with associated narrative context, speech verbs, and adverbs for expressive fine-tuning and benchmarking.

Result: Fine-tuning a baseline TTS system with LibriQuote improved speech intelligibility while emphasizing the challenge for existing systems to generate expressive, natural speech comparable to ground-truth utterances.

Conclusion: LibriQuote demonstrates significant potential for advancing TTS expressiveness, but current systems still fall short of achieving human-like expressiveness. The dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

*Viktor Stein,Wuchen Li*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Descent (ASVGD), combining SVGD and Nesterov's acceleration to address slow sampling in SVGD. ASVGD improves convergence rates and efficiency, especially in high-dimensional Bayesian inference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGD is non-parametric, kernel-based, and doesn't require score estimation, yet often lags behind score-based sampling methods in terms of speed and efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce accelerated SVGD combining Nesterov's accelerated gradient flow in probability density space with a Wasserstein metric regularization. The algorithm is momentum-based and deterministic for particle updates.

Result: The paper provides optimal convergence rates for specific kernel parameters and damping, demonstrating ASVGD's improved efficiency through numerical examples and experiments. ASVGD significantly outperforms other methods in Bayesian neural network tasks.

Conclusion: ASVGD achieves faster convergence and better sampling efficiency by leveraging acceleration techniques, positioning it as a strong alternative to vanilla SVGD and similar methods for high-dimensional sampling tasks.

Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and
non-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as
in Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other
particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the
gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to
score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient
high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce
accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric
space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a
momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of
particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we
also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the
conference version \cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target
distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an
optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by
analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.
Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on
the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel
functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target
distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other
popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian
neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of
log-likelihood and total iteration times.

*Iman Seyedi,Antonio Candelieri,Enza Messina,Francesco Archetti*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper explores the evolution of the assignment problem using optimal transport and Gromov-Wasserstein distances to address quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) and their applications. It introduces novel strategies like GW-MultiInit for improved and scalable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for efficient and scalable methods to solve the assignment problem, particularly the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), which arises in diverse real-world scenarios such as machine learning, logistics, and graph matching.

Method: The paper connects traditional assignment techniques to modern optimal transport theories using Gromov-Wasserstein distances. It develops exact solvers, genetic algorithms, and new GW variants like GW-MultiInit and entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations to improve scalability and solution quality.

Result: Computational experiments demonstrate that GW-MultiInit achieves near-optimal solutions efficiently for large-scale QAP instances. Additional methods like EGW and FGW offer flexible trade-offs between runtime and accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimal transport and Gromov-Wasserstein methods provide a robust theoretical and computational framework for tackling QAP and related matching problems, enabling practical applications across various fields with efficient and scalable solutions.

Abstract: The assignment problem, a cornerstone of operations research, seeks an
optimal one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks to minimize total cost.
This work traces its evolution from classical formulations and algorithms to
modern optimal transport (OT) theory, positioning the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP) and related structural matching tasks within this framework. We
connect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,
Kantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where
source and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW
variant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address
QAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances
and cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint
correspondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed
multi-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting
stuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and
fused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that
GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales
efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while
parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy
and runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational
insights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and
other real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and
logistics.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of the shuffling heuristic in solving variational inequalities, provides theoretical convergence guarantees, and demonstrates improved performance over traditional independent sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical guarantees for the widely used shuffling heuristic in solving variational inequalities.

Method: The study provides theoretical convergence bounds and rates for shuffling methods and validates them with extensive experiments on benchmark problems.

Result: Shuffling methods exhibit faster convergence compared to independent data sampling approaches, as demonstrated by theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Conclusion: The research establishes shuffling as a viable alternative to independent sampling for variational inequalities, backed by theoretical and experimental evidence.

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine
learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these
problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an
alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves
permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal
consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical
guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We
address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for
shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and
convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class
of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on
diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster
convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.

*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the robustness of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly in the health domain, against adversarial misinformation in retrieved evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of RAG systems to absorb and reproduce misinformation from retrieved evidence, especially in high-stakes domains like health, where incorrect answers could have harmful consequences.

Method: The authors conducted controlled experiments on health-related questions by varying the type and composition of retrieved evidence (helpful, harmful, adversarial) and framing of user questions (consistent, neutral, inconsistent) to assess model robustness.

Result: Findings indicate that adversarial documents significantly reduce alignment with ground truth, but robustness is maintained when helpful evidence is present in the retrieval pool.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for retrieval safeguards to mitigate the risks of misinformation, offering insights for building safer RAG systems in critical domains.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

TL;DR: NER Retriever utilizes internal representations of LLMs to embed entity mentions and user-defined descriptions for zero-shot ad-hoc Named Entity Retrieval, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Named Entity Retrieval without relying on predefined schemas or fine-tuned models, enabling flexible and scalable retrieval based on user input.

Method: The framework embeds entity mentions and type descriptions into a shared semantic space using mid-layer transformer block value vectors and trains a contrastive projection network to refine type-alignment and separability.

Result: NER Retriever outperforms lexical and sentence-level retrieval methods across three benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of its compact and type-aware embeddings.

Conclusion: This approach validates internal representation selection in LLMs and offers a scalable solution for schema-free entity retrieval, with publicly available code for broader use.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER

TL;DR: Introduction of the Automated Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework to ensure recommender systems satisfy secondary guardrail objectives alongside primary optimization goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for ensuring secondary constraints ('guardrails') in recommender systems without manual hyperparameter tuning, which is difficult amid system and user behavior changes.

Method: Development of the ACT framework, which uses offline pairwise evaluations on unbiased data to identify and implement minimal hyperparameter adjustments.

Result: ACT effectively adapts to changing systems and user behaviors, demonstrating its efficacy in empirical testing and large-scale production deployment.

Conclusion: ACT ensures consistent user experiences and platform stability by automating guardrail satisfaction, removing the need for manual interventions.

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotations for relevance evaluation in personalized search suffer from high costs and long turnaround times, limiting scalability.

Method: The authors fine-tuned LLMs to automate relevance evaluations and compared LLM-generated judgments to human annotations to assess their alignment.

Result: LLMs were validated to produce reliable relevance judgments, improving evaluation efficiency, enabling larger query sets, optimized sampling, and broader search experience assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based method produces higher-quality relevance metrics, enhances scalability, and reduces the Minimum Detectable Effect in online experiments.

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum

*Dror Aiger,Bingyi Cao,Kaifeng Chen,Andre Araujo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a "local-to-global" image retrieval paradigm, leveraging efficient local feature search and dynamic global feature re-ranking, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image retrieval systems prioritize global-to-local features due to computational limitations, often failing to capture partial image matches.

Method: The study introduces a novel "local-to-global" design using efficient local feature retrieval and dynamic global feature re-ranking based on re-ranking-only global features computed with multidimensional scaling techniques.

Result: This approach achieved superior retrieval performance compared to existing systems, setting new benchmarks on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm shows promise in boosting retrieval systems, enabling robust performance by combining local and global features dynamically.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

Result: Technical-Embeddings significantly surpasses baseline models in precision and recall when evaluated on RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA datasets.

Conclusion: The study showcases the success of integrating query expansion and summarization for improved semantic retrieval in technical contexts, advancing RAG systems for engineering workflows.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pinterest needed a solution to effectively deliver personalized Pins and ads leveraging diverse data sources.

Method: A novel embedding framework was developed using asynchronous upstream-downstream models, where embeddings were precomputed and supplied to downstream tasks.

Result: Performance improvements were observed in offline and online metrics, and the framework was successfully deployed in Pinterest’s production systems.

Conclusion: The framework added value by enhancing ad ranking systems, improving both computational scalability and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,

### [340] [Revealing Fine Structure in Protoplanetary Disks with Physics Constrained Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03623)
*Aviad Levis,Nhan Luong,Richard Teague,Katherine. L. Bouman,Marcelo Barraza-Alfaro,Kevin Flaherty*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computational framework using physics-constrained neural fields and differentiable rendering to analyze protoplanetary disks. It employs RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated solver for efficient radiative transfer, revealing previously undetected features in disk structure from ALMA observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand intricate 3D structures of protoplanetary disks to explore disk evolution and enhance planet formation theories. Existing methods lack capacity to resolve high-resolution data from ALMA.

Method: The authors integrate neural fields with differentiable rendering and develop RadJAX, a GPU-enhanced line radiative transfer solver that operates significantly faster than traditional ray tracers.

Result: RadJAX revealed fine structures in the HD 163296 disk, specifically the vertical morphology of the CO-rich region and a flattening of its emission surface beyond 400 au. Conventional methodologies missed these features.

Conclusion: This framework establishes a novel approach to analyze protoplanetary disk structures, enabling faster and more detailed reconstructions of disk dynamics and contributing to the study of planetary formation processes.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture
features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational
framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable
rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature
missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting
complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary
evolution.

### [341] [Divergence-Kernel method for linear responses and diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03992)
*Angxiu Ni*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper presents a formula for linear response in random dynamical systems and a Monte-Carlo algorithm linked to it, alongside a novel diffusion generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of analyzing linear responses of random dynamical systems, including those with multiplicative and parameterized noise, and extend its practical application.

Method: Derived a divergence-kernel formula in linear response, passed it to a continuous-time limit, and developed a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm.

Result: Introduced a forward-only diffusion generative model and validated it on basic problems, demonstrating the applicability of the derived formula and algorithm.

Conclusion: The work offers novel insights and tools for linear response analysis, applicable to a broad class of dynamical systems without stringent conditions.

Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response
(parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random
dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula
works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it
does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm
for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative
model and test on simple problems.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: MatterVial is a hybrid framework combining feature-based machine learning and pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) for materials science, achieving significant error reductions and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive accuracy and interpretability in materials science models by integrating transparent feature-based modeling with powerful deep learning techniques.

Method: MatterVial integrates latent representations from pretrained GNNs, computationally efficient approximations, and symbolic regression, combining transparency and predictive power.

Result: MatterVial significantly reduces errors and achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by over 40% on multiple tasks in Matbench, while also enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: MatterVial provides a highly transparent, interpretable, and high-performance framework, advancing explainable AI and materials discovery methods.

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted
and autonomous materials discovery.

### [343] [Simplicity Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: A Strategic Perspective on Controllers in Reactive Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04129)
*Mickael Randour*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the complexity of strategies in game-theoretic controller synthesis, emphasizing memory and randomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the complexity of strategies in controller synthesis to identify simpler, cost-effective methods for system design.

Method: Analyzing recent research findings on memory and randomness in strategies, while exploring novel perspectives on complexity.

Result: Insights into the roles of memory and randomness and their implications for controller strategies.

Conclusion: Understanding the complexity of strategies provides guidance for designing simpler and efficient controllers.

Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the
interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game
between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal)
strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a
real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited
memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive
and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a
variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and
randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions
of complexity for strategies.
