Here, we introduce a novel framework,\nINS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),\nto enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our\nmethod integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that\nevaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling\nmechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they\nappear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a\npre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral\npairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy\nexperiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored\nphenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the\nlikelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena.

Project page: https://jaeyeonkim99.github.io/wow_bench/", "summary": "Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the\nauditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as\npitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level\nlistening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models\nmust reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to\nevaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal\nvocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing\nnovel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess\nthe abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the\nCognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate\nwhether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying\non other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance\nfar below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in\nLALMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study introduces the World-of-Whale (WoW-Bench) benchmark to evaluate large audio language models' (LALMs) capabilities in low-level auditory tasks using marine mammal vocalizations.", "motivation": "To address the gap in evaluating LALMs' ability to perform fine-grained auditory perception and cognition tasks, especially in real-world scenarios involving unfamiliar sounds.", "method": "The WoW-Bench benchmark includes a Perception section for categorizing sounds and a Cognition section inspired by Bloom's taxonomy to test remembering, understanding, applying, and analyzing sounds.

Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues.
