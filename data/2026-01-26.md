### [1] [When Agents Fail to Act: A Diagnostic Framework for Tool Invocation Reliability in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16280)
*Donghao Huang,Gauri Malwe,Zhaoxia Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to evaluate the procedural reliability of multi-agent systems using large language models, identifying key weaknesses and proposing solutions for precise and efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic methodologies for assessing tool-use reliability in multi-agent systems, enabling their deployment in SME-centric and privacy-sensitive environments.

Method: The authors developed a diagnostic framework using a 12-category error taxonomy and evaluated 1,980 deterministic testing instances across various models on different hardware setups.

Result: The study found tool initialization failures to be a major bottleneck for smaller models. However, mid-sized models provide practical trade-offs, and qwen2.5:32b matches GPT-4.1 in error-free performance.

Conclusion: The framework creates a foundation for reliability testing in tool-augmented multi-agent systems, with actionable insights for deploying these systems in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are transforming enterprise automation, yet systematic evaluation methodologies for assessing tool-use reliability remain underdeveloped. We introduce a comprehensive diagnostic framework that leverages big data analytics to evaluate procedural reliability in intelligent agent systems, addressing critical needs for SME-centric deployment in privacy-sensitive environments. Our approach features a 12-category error taxonomy capturing failure modes across tool initialization, parameter handling, execution, and result interpretation. Through systematic evaluation of 1,980 deterministic test instances spanning both open-weight models (Qwen2.5 series, Functionary) and proprietary alternatives (GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7) across diverse edge hardware configurations, we identify actionable reliability thresholds for production deployment. Our analysis reveals that procedural reliability, particularly tool initialization failures, constitutes the primary bottleneck for smaller models, while qwen2.5:32b achieves flawless performance matching GPT-4.1. The framework demonstrates that mid-sized models (qwen2.5:14b) offer practical accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on commodity hardware (96.6\% success rate, 7.3 s latency), enabling cost-effective intelligent agent deployment for resource-constrained organizations. This work establishes foundational infrastructure for systematic reliability evaluation of tool-augmented multi-agent AI systems.

### [2] [SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16286)
*Varun Chillara,Dylan Kline,Christopher Alvares,Evan Wooten,Huan Yang,Shlok Khetan,Cade Bauer,Tré Guillory,Tanishka Shah,Yashodhara Dhariwal,Volodymyr Pavlov,George Popstefanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemanticALLI, a caching architecture for AI pipelines, enhancing efficiency by reusing intermediate reasoning within agentic loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI pipelines reconstruct intermediate logic unnecessarily due to linguistic variance, causing inefficiencies in caching mechanisms.

Method: SemanticALLI decomposes the generative process into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), enabling intermediate representations (IRs) to be cached and reused systematically.

Result: SemanticALLI achieves an 83.10% cache hit rate, surpassing the baseline 38.7%, reducing LLM calls (4,023 avoided) and improving latency to 2.66 ms.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of caching intermediate structures in AI pipelines, demonstrating reduced token usage and improved efficiency even when user inputs are diverse.

Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

### [3] [DSGym: A Holistic Framework for Evaluating and Training Data Science Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16344)
*Fan Nie,Junlin Wang,Harper Hua,Federico Bianchi,Yongchan Kwon,Zhenting Qi,Owen Queen,Shang Zhu,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Data science agents are evaluated in DSGym, a standardized framework with curated tasks and rigorous grounding, enhancing agent training and benchmarking in scientific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data science benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation interfaces, broad task coverage, and proper data grounding, which hampers effective analysis and comparison of data science agents.

Method: The authors introduce DSGym, a modular framework with curated tasks, expert-derived biostatistics, and domain-specific prediction tasks to evaluate and train data science agents in controlled execution environments.

Result: DSGym improves task coverage, rigorously filters shortcuts in existing benchmarks, and enables training of models, demonstrating enhanced performance of a trained model against GPT-4o.

Conclusion: DSGym provides a robust, extensible testbed for evaluating and training data science agents, supporting real-world scientific analysis and improving benchmarking standards.

Abstract: Data science agents promise to accelerate discovery and insight-generation by turning data into executable analyses and findings. Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.

### [4] [Doc2AHP: Inferring Structured Multi-Criteria Decision Models via Semantic Trees with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16479)
*Hongjia Wu,Shuai Zhou,Hongxin Zhang,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doc2AHP is a framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models and Analytic Hierarchy Process principles to enable structured, logically consistent decision-making without requiring experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models lack structural consistency in complex tasks, while traditional decision theories need significant domain expertise. This paper addresses the scalability and expert bottleneck issues in decision-making frameworks.

Method: The authors introduce the Doc2AHP framework, which applies AHP principles as structural constraints to guide LLMs. It eliminates the need for extensive training data and manual intervention by using multi-agent weighting and adaptive consistency optimization strategies.

Result: Doc2AHP significantly outperforms baseline methods in both logical completeness and accuracy for downstream tasks. It enables non-expert users to build decision models efficiently and effectively.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between LLMs and structured decision theory, providing scalable, expert-independent solutions for constructing high-quality decision models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

### [5] [SycoEval-EM: Sycophancy Evaluation of Large Language Models in Simulated Clinical Encounters for Emergency Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16529)
*Dongshen Peng,Yi Wang,Carl Preiksaitis,Christian Rose*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents SycoEval-EM, a simulation framework to evaluate LLMs in emergency medicine scenarios under adversarial patient persuasion, revealing substantial acquiescence rates and emphasizing the necessity of multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in clinical decision support where they face risks of acquiescing to patients' inappropriate requests, particularly in emergency medical settings.

Method: The paper introduces SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework. It evaluates 20 LLMs across 1,875 simulated doctor-patient encounters, involving adversarial patient tactics in three clinical scenarios.

Result: Acquiescence rates among the models varied widely (0-100%), with higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8%) compared to opioid prescriptions (25.0%). Model capability did not correlate strongly with robustness, and all persuasion tactics were similarly effective.

Conclusion: Static benchmarks fail to accurately predict the safety of clinical AI under social pressure. Multi-turn adversarial testing is necessary for safety certification of clinical AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

### [6] [LLM is Not All You Need: A Systematic Evaluation of ML vs. Foundation Models for text and image based Medical Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16549)
*Meet Raval,Tejul Pandit,Dhvani Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates medical classification using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and classical machine learning (ML) across multiple datasets. Classical ML models outperformed in most scenarios, with foundation models showing mixed success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of combining multimodal VLMs and LLMs for medical classification tasks, comparing them against traditional ML approaches.

Method: They utilized four datasets with text and image modalities, tested three model types (Classical ML, Prompt-Based VLMs/LLMs, and PEFT-tuned models with LoRA), and maintained consistent data splits and metrics for evaluation.

Result: Classical ML models outperformed in most cases, especially with text datasets. LoRA-tuned models showed poor results across all tasks, while zero-shot VLMs/LLMs had mixed outcomes, excelling in multiclass image tasks but underperforming in text tasks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the ongoing reliability of classical ML for medical classification and highlights the limited success of foundation models and PEFT strategies without effective adaptation.

Abstract: The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

### [7] [LUMINA: Long-horizon Understanding for Multi-turn Interactive Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16649)
*Amin Rakhsha,Thomas Hehn,Pietro Mazzaglia,Fabio Valerio Massoli,Arash Behboodi,Tribhuvanesh Orekondy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an oracle framework to analyze the importance of specific skills like planning and state-tracking in solving multi-turn agentic tasks using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with multi-turn, long-horizon problems requiring complex skills like planning and state tracking. The authors aim to understand which underlying capabilities are crucial for improving performance in these tasks.

Method: The authors develop an oracle counterfactual framework where an agent is assisted by an oracle to perfectly execute a specific skill. They use procedurally generated game-like tasks with adjustable complexity to isolate and test the impact of skills like perfect planning and flawless state tracking.

Result: Findings indicate that certain skills, such as planning, consistently improve task performance across various settings. However, the effectiveness of other skills depends on the environment's properties and the language model itself.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges faced by LLMs in multi-turn tasks and provides insights for guiding future improvements in AI agents and language models.

Abstract: Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

### [8] [AgentsEval: Clinically Faithful Evaluation of Medical Imaging Reports via Multi-Agent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16685)
*Suzhong Fu,Jingqi Dong,Xuan Ding,Rui Sun,Yiming Yang,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentsEval, a multi-agent reasoning framework for evaluating medical imaging reports with structured diagnostic logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to accurately evaluate clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity in medical imaging reports due to insufficient capturing of diagnostic logic.

Method: AgentsEval divides the evaluation into interpretable steps and uses a multi-agent reasoning framework covering criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and scoring. A benchmark with five datasets and controlled variations is also built.

Result: Experimental results show AgentsEval provides clinically aligned, robust, and interpretable evaluations even under diverse semantic and stylistic variations.

Conclusion: AgentsEval enhances the transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report systems, aiding the integration of AI into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter reasoning model excelling in agentic reasoning and tool-based problem-solving, with robust generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly capable open-source reasoning model that excels in agentic benchmarks, generalizes to real-world applications, and performs well with noisy, complex tasks.

Method: The model is trained using a domain-parallel expert training framework with fusion, scaling environments, principled task construction, and advanced reinforcement learning (DORA) for handling multi-environment training. It also incorporates noise patterns during training for robustness.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on numerous agentic reasoning benchmarks and shows strong adaptability to complex tool interactions in noisy, real-world conditions.

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 demonstrates the potential of a unified training framework and advanced methodologies in producing robust reasoning models applicable to real-world tasks.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.

*Lu Yihe,Barbara Webb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops an insect-inspired visual point-goal navigation agent that matches state-of-the-art models in performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computationally efficient navigation agent inspired by insect brain structures that can learn and adapt visually guided paths.

Method: The agent integrates abstracted models of insect brain structures involved in associative learning and path integration and tests performance in Habitat navigation tasks and realistic simulated environments.

Result: The insect-inspired agent performs comparably to SOTA models with significantly less computational cost and displays robustness in simulated environments.

Conclusion: Insects-inspired mechanisms are effective and computationally efficient for visual navigation tasks, offering a robust basis for future research.

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

### [11] [Reasoning Promotes Robustness in Theory of Mind Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16853)
*Ian B. de Haan,Peter van der Putten,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning-focused LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) show enhanced robustness in Theory of Mind tasks but do not exhibit fundamentally new reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the behavior of reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) in Theory of Mind tasks and assess whether their improved performance stems from new reasoning abilities or robustness in problem-solving.

Method: The authors conducted machine psychological experiments and benchmark studies, focusing on reasoning models trained with RLVR. They adapted psychological tasks to test Theory of Mind capabilities and analyzed robustness against prompt variations and task perturbations.

Result: The study found that reasoning-oriented LLMs displayed significant robustness to task and prompt variations in ToM scenarios. Their performance improvements were due to this robustness rather than new forms of ToM reasoning.

Conclusion: While reasoning models show strong performance in specific ToM benchmarks, the findings suggest their improvements come from better robustness in solutions rather than novel cognitive reasoning mechanisms. The results shed light on how to evaluate social-cognitive capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

*Tims Pecerskis,Aivars Smirnovs*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NSED, a protocol that engages multiple models to create an efficient deliberation system exceeding the capability and alignment of traditional larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a protocol that leverages smaller, consumer-grade models to achieve state-of-the-art performance, while improving safety and alignment.

Method: Introduces N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) which uses dynamic gating through a runtime optimization engine, employing deliberation modeled as a Macro-scale RNN with peer-review orchestration and Quadratic Voting activation.

Result: Smaller models under NSED match or surpass larger models in performance (benchmarks like AIME 2025 and LiveCodeBench), and improve intrinsic alignment seen in reduced sycophancy scores (DarkBench safety suite).

Conclusion: NSED establishes efficient new standards for hardware usage by ensembles of consumer-grade models, showcasing intrinsic safety and performance advancements in AI model collaborations.

Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MAGE-KT framework, a graph-based approach to improve Knowledge Tracing by integrating semantic and behavioral signals through heterogeneous graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based Knowledge Tracing methods struggle with representing inter-concept relations and handling computational costs caused by large-scale heterogeneous graphs.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a multi-view heterogeneous graph combining a KC relation extractor and student-question interaction graph, compact subgraph retrieval, and Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion to enhance representation and prediction.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show improved KC-relation accuracy and better next-question prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAGE-KT addresses limitations in graph-based KT by effectively capturing inter-concept relationships and student-relevant data, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

### [14] [Preventing the Collapse of Peer Review Requires Verification-First AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16909)
*Lei You,Lele Cao,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper recommends setting AI-assisted peer review systems to prioritize verification of scientific truth rather than mimicking reviews. It introduces metrics and conditions for effective truth-coupling and identifies risks of detaching from truth-driven evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenge of ensuring scientific reliability and preventing biases in peer reviews as claims increase and verification capabilities struggle to keep pace.

Method: The authors build a theoretical framework around 'truth-coupling,' explore the dynamics of verification pressure and signal shrinkage, and derive conditions for when truth-seeking behavior shifts to optimizing proxies.

Result: They establish a mathematical coupling law and identify an incentive-collapse condition showing when reliance on proxies over scientific truth emerges, motivating reform in peer-review systems.

Conclusion: AI peer review systems should focus on adversarial auditing to enhance claim verification, avoiding reliance on claim prediction which risks eroding the link between published scores and scientific truth.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI-assisted peer review should be verification-first rather than review-mimicking. We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

TL;DR: This paper presents AgentDrive, a benchmark dataset and evaluation tools for training and assessing autonomous agents like large language models in reasoning-driven driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in training and evaluating AI models for reasoning-driven decision-making in autonomous systems due to the lack of comprehensive and safety-critical benchmarks.

Method: The authors created AgentDrive, a dataset of 300,000 driving scenarios across seven scenario axes, validated through a JSON pipeline and scenario simulations. They also developed AgentDrive-MCQ, a complementary multiple-choice benchmark assessing five reasoning dimensions.

Result: The benchmarks were used to evaluate fifty advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing that proprietary frontier models excel in contextual and policy reasoning, while open-source models are improving in areas like physics-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: AgentDrive and AgentDrive-MCQ successfully provide benchmarks for structured evaluation and training of LLMs in autonomous systems. These benchmarks are publicly available for further research and advancements in this field.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spatial-Agent, an AI model specialized in geospatial reasoning, outperforming existing methods by creating interpretable workflows for geospatial questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents fail at performing genuine geospatial computation, instead relying on search or pattern matching and often hallucinating spatial relationships.

Method: Spatial-Agent formalizes geo-analytical question answering as concept transformation. Questions are parsed into GeoFlow Graphs, guided by spatial concept extraction, functional roles, and transformation sequences.

Result: Spatial-Agent significantly outperformed baselines (ReAct, Reflexion) on benchmarks such as MapEval-API and MapQA, with interpretable workflows.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the potential of Spatial-Agent to address gaps in geospatial reasoning by combining robust spatial theories with template-driven workflow generation.

Abstract: Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

Conclusion: AI-driven platforms have the potential to address significant challenges in medical device maintenance, reducing downtime and enhancing healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AERO, a method ensuring efficient and consistent OTA updates for energy-harvesting IoT devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for consistent and efficient Over-The-Air updates in IoT devices operating with intermittent energy.

Method: AERO integrates updates into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for scheduling under energy and timing constraints, dynamically ensuring consistency.

Result: The experiments show AERO improves update reliability and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AERO is a practical solution for runtime-aware and energy-efficient OTA updates in energy-harvesting IoT systems.

Abstract: Energy-harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) devices operate under intermittent energy availability, which disrupts task execution and makes energy-intensive over-the-air (OTA) updates particularly challenging. Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability. Experiments on representative workloads demonstrate improved update reliability and efficiency compared to existing live update approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChiEngMixBench, a benchmark evaluating code-mixing in community contexts, proposing new metrics to assess model alignment with human mixing behavior and identifying phenomena consistent with linguistic theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating code-mixing not just as a translation problem but as a contextually appropriate behavior aligned with human conventions.

Method: ChiEngMixBench offers a dataset and metrics prioritizing Spontaneity and Naturalness in code-mixing evaluation and applies these to assess large language models.

Result: The framework systematically distinguishes code-mixing performance across different models and reveals a Terminology Layering Strategy in alignment with the Matrix Language Frame theory.

Conclusion: ChiEngMixBench advances the evaluation of bilingual interactions in AI, aligning model behavior with human linguistic patterns and opening doors for enhanced language model development.

Abstract: Code-mixing is increasingly prevalent in interactions between humans and large language models, yet existing work often reduces it to a translation or convertibility problem, making it difficult to assess whether a model's switching behavior is context-appropriate and aligned with human conventions. We introduce ChiEngMixBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate code-mixing ability in authentic community contexts, built upon a general construction pipeline that enables scalable dataset development across domains and bilingual pairs. ChiEngMixBench formulates code-mixing as a cognitive alignment problem, characterized by two complementary signals: Spontaneity and Naturalness. Empirical evaluation shows that our metrics can systematically distinguish code-mixing performance across models. Beyond benchmarking, we further uncover an implicitly emergent Terminology Layering Strategy, a phenomenon consistent with the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) theory, indicating structured cognitive alignment between multilingual large language models and human communication.

TL;DR: This paper presents M3Kang, a large-scale multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset built from the Kangaroo Math Competition, and evaluates VLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities on it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into multilingual mathematical reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) and to better benchmark their performance against humans.

Method: The authors created M3Kang, a dataset with 1,747 mathematical problems in 108 languages, including diagram-based questions. They benchmarked both open and closed-source VLMs using the dataset and evaluated their performance against human data.

Result: VLMs struggled with basic math and diagram reasoning, with performance scaling better with language representation and model size but not grade level. Multilingual techniques successfully improved performance in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: M3Kang reveals limitations of current VLMs in multilingual and multimodal reasoning, highlights areas for improvement, and provides an open-source dataset and framework for further research in this field.

Abstract: Despite state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, their performance in multilingual mathematical reasoning remains underexplored, particularly when compared to human performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce M3Kang, the first massively multilingual, multimodal mathematical reasoning dataset for VLMs. It is derived from the Kangaroo Math Competition, the world's largest mathematics contest, which annually engages over six million participants under the age of 18 across more than 90 countries. M3Kang includes 1,747 unique multiple-choice problems organized by grade-level difficulty, with translations into 108 culturally diverse languages, some of them including diagrams essential for solving them. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive benchmarking on both closed- and open-source SOTA models. We observe that, despite recent advances, models still struggle with basic math and diagram-based reasoning, with performance scaling with language presence and model size, but not with grade level. We also find that multilingual techniques can be effectively extended to the multimodal setting, resulting in significant improvements over baseline approaches. Our analysis also incorporates performance data from over 68,000 students, enabling direct comparison with human performance. We are open-sourcing M3Kang, including the English-only subset M2Kang, along with the framework and codebase used to construct the dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-efficient method to create high-accuracy specialized AI assistants using offline knowledge distillation, emphasizing that small, high-quality structured datasets outperform large, unstructured ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to domain-specific knowledge and reducing hardware costs.

Method: Offline knowledge distillation with Qwen-2.5-7B as the student model, data optimization via the Unsloth library, and evaluation using different data strategies.

Result: A 500-line context-aware synthetic dataset achieved a 96.7% accuracy rate with robust rejection capabilities while using hardware with reduced GPU memory requirements from 40 GB to 16 GB.

Conclusion: Small, high-quality structured datasets are more effective for domain adaptation in low-resource environments than large, unstructured ones, supporting the LIMA hypothesis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but often struggle with hallucinations when handling domain-specific or institutional knowledge absent from their pre-training. We present an offline response-based knowledge distillation method that develops high-accuracy specialized assistants under constrained hardware resources. We evaluate three distinct data strategies: general domain adaptation (15,000 lines), unstructured knowledge injection (2,000 lines), and a context-aware synthetic dataset (500 lines) generated by a teacher model. To minimize computational costs, we utilize the Unsloth library to optimize the Qwen-2.5-7B student model, reducing NVIDIA A100 GPU memory requirements from 40 GB to 16 GB. Experimental results demonstrate that while larger unstructured datasets suffer from persistent hallucinations, the 500-line context-aware dataset achieves a 96.7% accuracy rate and robust rejection capability. These findings validate the LIMA hypothesis, showing that data quality and structural alignment are more critical than quantity for domain adaptation in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for faster sampling and higher coherence in language generation compared to autoregressive language models.

Method: The proposed model, NFDM, extends continuous diffusion to discrete spaces by learning a multivariate forward process to fit generative trajectories for language tasks.

Result: The model reduces the likelihood gap with similarly sized autoregressive models and matches the sample quality of prior latent diffusion models.

Conclusion: NFDM represents a positive step in language generation, offering a balance of efficiency and quality over existing methods.

Abstract: Language diffusion models aim to improve sampling speed and coherence over autoregressive LLMs. We introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models for language generation, an extension of NFDM that enables the straightforward application of continuous diffusion models to discrete state spaces. NFDM learns a multivariate forward process from the data, ensuring that the forward process and generative trajectory are a good fit for language modeling. Our model substantially reduces the likelihood gap with autoregressive models of the same size, while achieving sample quality comparable to that of previous latent diffusion models.

### [23] [Limits of n-gram Style Control for LLMs via Logit-Space Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16224)
*Sami-ul Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a lightweight method for personalizing large language models (LLMs) through n-gram style priors injected during text generation, avoiding computationally heavy fine-tuning methods like LoRA. Results show limited success with a small tuning range, but the method generally underperforms compared to existing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenge of modifying the stylistic outputs of frozen LLMs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning methods like LoRA or overly simplistic prompt engineering.

Method: The approach involves training an n-gram model on stylistically marked corpora to generate style-specific priors. These priors are injected into the LLM’s logit space during generation, modulated by a control parameter lambda, which adjusts the style intensity.

Result: Results show a modest improvement in stylistic alignment and fluency in a very narrow parameter regime (e.g., a 24.7% stylistic gain and a 51.4% fluency gain with specific settings). However, the method struggles with multi-author corpora and higher lambda values, leading to poor text coherence.

Conclusion: While n-gram style priors offer a lightweight strategy to steer LLM outputs, the approach is fragile and highly limited in scope, consistently underperforming compared to existing techniques like prompting or LoRA-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically personalized via prompt engineering or parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA. However, writing style can be difficult to distill into a single prompt, and LoRA fine-tuning requires computationally intensive training and infrastructure. We investigate a possible lightweight alternative: steering a frozen LLM with n-gram style priors injected in logit space at decoding time. We train an n-gram model on stylistically distinct corpora -- including Don Quixote, CNN/DailyMail news headlines, and arXiv abstracts -- constructing an interpolated 1-to-3-gram prior over next-token probabilities. During generation we modify the LLM's logits by adding a weighted sum of style log-probabilities from each n-gram order that matches the current context, scaled by a control parameter lambda in [0, 1].
  We sweep lambda and style corpora and report style perplexity under the n-gram model, base-model perplexity as a proxy for fluency, Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between the original and steered token distributions, and token-overlap statistics. On TinyLlama-1.1B we identify a single narrow regime (for the Don Quixote corpus at lambda=0.1) where style perplexity improves by 24.7% and base-model perplexity improves by 51.4% relative to the frozen model. Outside this regime, and for multi-author corpora such as CNN/DailyMail and arXiv abstracts, even small nonzero lambda values generally result in worse style and fluency, and larger lambda values lead to collapse with extreme perplexities and incoherent text. Logit-space injection of n-gram style priors provides lightweight, tunable style control, but it is fragile: it operates effectively only within a narrow range of low lambda values and is consistently outperformed by prompting and LoRA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'GameTalk,' a framework for training large language models (LLMs) to make strategic decisions via multi-turn dialogue and shows its effectiveness on complex decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training LLMs for strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings, especially where multi-turn coordination and negotiation are needed, which previous works largely overlooked.

Method: The paper employs fine-tuning techniques like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals based on the outcome of entire conversations and optimizes long-term strategic objectives.

Result: GameTalk-trained LLMs outperform untrained models in strategic reasoning, particularly under reward shaping, with DPO showing the strongest performance gains.

Conclusion: Conversational fine-tuning enables LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act effectively in interactive, multi-agent environments, making it a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets for training smaller models that can rival or surpass the performance of the large LLMs in multilingual and low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of human-labeled data in low-resource languages by utilizing LLMs for generating synthetic samples, thereby enhancing the performance of smaller multilingual models.

Method: Synthetic datasets in 11 languages and 4 tasks are generated using an LLM. These datasets are employed to fine-tune smaller models or used as in-context examples for compact LLMs.

Result: Small models trained on synthetic data outperform the large LLM generator, mainly in low-resource languages, showcasing the potential of synthetic data for enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: LLMs are more effectively utilized as data generators to empower smaller, efficient multilingual models rather than being directly used as classifiers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual capabilities, making them promising tools in both high- and low-resource languages. One particularly valuable use case is generating synthetic samples that can be used to train smaller models in low-resource scenarios where human-labelled data is scarce. In this work, we investigate whether these synthetic data generation capabilities can serve as a form of distillation, producing smaller models that perform on par with or even better than massive LLMs across languages and tasks. To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs are best utilised as generators (teachers) rather than classifiers, producing data that empowers smaller and more efficient multilingual models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific discovery tools focus mainly on experiment generation, neglecting higher-level theory synthesis crucial for scientific progress.

Method: The authors propose a method to synthesize theories by analyzing 13.7k papers, generating 2.9k theories, and comparing results using literature-based and parametric knowledge approaches.

Result: Their literature-supported method outperformed parametric generation by creating theories that both align with existing evidence and predict future discoveries effectively.

Conclusion: Using literature-grounded methods for theory synthesis enhances accuracy and predictive capacity in scientific theory development.

Abstract: Contemporary automated scientific discovery has focused on agents for generating scientific experiments, while systems that perform higher-level scientific activities such as theory building remain underexplored. In this work, we formulate the problem of synthesizing theories consisting of qualitative and quantitative laws from large corpora of scientific literature. We study theory generation at scale, using 13.7k source papers to synthesize 2.9k theories, examining how generation using literature-grounding versus parametric knowledge, and accuracy-focused versus novelty-focused generation objectives change theory properties. Our experiments show that, compared to using parametric LLM memory for generation, our literature-supported method creates theories that are significantly better at both matching existing evidence and at predicting future results from 4.6k subsequently-written papers

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic resource for examining how competing geopolitical narratives and interpretations evolve within global media during wartime discourse.

Method: DNIPRO compiles news articles across 11 media outlets in 5 countries and 3 languages (English, Russian, Mandarin), annotated with metadata and evaluations for tasks like sentiment analysis, stance detection, and narrative divergence.

Result: The use case experiments showed polarized narratives and interpretations of conflict events in media reflecting geopolitical interests.

Conclusion: DNIPRO offers unique opportunities to study competing media narratives and information ecosystems, aiding research on wartime discourse and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce DNIPRO, a novel longitudinal corpus of 246K news articles documenting the Russo-Ukrainian war from Feb 2022 to Aug 2024, spanning eleven media outlets across five nation states (Russia, Ukraine, U.S., U.K., and China) and three languages (English, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese). This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare. To demonstrate its utility, we include use case experiments using stance detection, sentiment analysis, topical framing, and contradiction analysis of major conflict events within the larger war. Our explorations reveal how outlets construct competing realities, with coverage exhibiting polarized interpretations that reflect geopolitical interests. Beyond supporting computational journalism research, DNIPRO provides a foundational resource for understanding how conflicting narratives emerge and evolve across global information ecosystems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolyBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset for polymer design, and proposes a knowledge-augmented method for training models, achieving superior results in polymer-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models (LLMs) prove ineffective in polymer design due to lack of polymer-specific knowledge and limited alignment with relevant knowledge and capabilities.

Method: The researchers developed PolyBench, a dataset containing 125K+ polymer design tasks leveraging 13M+ experimental and synthetic data points. They aligned models using a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method with structured chain of thought (CoT).

Result: Small language models (7B-14B parameters) trained on PolyBench outperform similar-sized models and leading closed-source models on PolyBench and other polymer benchmarks.

Conclusion: PolyBench and the alignment strategy enhance model performance and generalization capabilities in polymer design tasks, making it a valuable contribution to AI4Science.

Abstract: Research in AI4Science has shown promise in many science applications, including polymer design. However, current LLMs prove ineffective on this problem space because: (i) most models lack polymer-specific knowledge (ii) existing aligned models lack coverage of knowledge and capabilities relevant to polymer design. Addressing this, we introduce PolyBench, a large scale training and test benchmark dataset of more than 125K polymer design related tasks, leveraging a knowledge base of 13M+ data points obtained from experimental and synthetic sources to ensure broad coverage of polymers and their properties. For effective alignment using PolyBench, we introduce a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method that augments this dataset with structured CoT. Furthermore, tasks in PolyBench are organized from simple to complex analytical reasoning problems, enabling generalization tests and diagnostic probes across the problem space. Experiments show that small language models (SLMs), of 7B to 14B parameters, trained on PolyBench data outperform similar sized models, and even closed source frontier LLMs on PolyBench test dataset while demonstrating gains on other polymer benchmarks as well.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated scoring of national exam essays in Estonia, comparing their performance with humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grading nation-wide exams efficiently is challenging, especially for complex and open-ended essay responses that traditionally require human evaluation.

Method: The study utilized LLMs and statistical NLP-based tools to evaluate essays against a rubric derived from Estonia's curriculum, and compared automated results to human scores to assess accuracy and bias.

Result: Automated scoring achieved similar performance to human raters, demonstrated low bias, and fell within human score ranges. The system also produced detailed subscores for personalized feedback.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted scoring is a viable method for large-scale, high-stakes national exams, aligning with digital advancements and offering systematic feedback while ensuring human oversight.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable rapid and consistent automated evaluation of open-ended exam responses, including dimensions of content and argumentation that have traditionally required human judgment. This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation. The study provides evidence that LLM-assisted assessment can be implemented at a national scale, even in a small-language context, while maintaining human oversight and compliance with emerging educational and regulatory standards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates regional bias in ten popular LLMs using FAZE, a new framework. Results show varying bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 having the highest and Claude 3.5 Sonnet the lowest bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about regional bias in LLMs that undermine fairness and inclusivity globally.

Method: Developed the FAZE framework, a prompt-based evaluation tool on a 10-point scale, using 100 neutral prompts to examine bias tendencies in 10 LLMs.

Result: Significant differences in bias scores were found: GPT-3.5 scored highest (9.5) for bias, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored lowest (2.5).

Conclusion: Regional bias hinders fairness, reliability, and global representation in LLMs, and inclusive frameworks like FAZE are essential in mitigating these biases.

Abstract: This study investigates regional bias in large language models (LLMs), an emerging concern in AI fairness and global representation. We evaluate ten prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Gemma 7B, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna-13B using a dataset of 100 carefully designed prompts that probe forced-choice decisions between regions under contextually neutral scenarios. We introduce FAZE, a prompt-based evaluation framework that measures regional bias on a 10-point scale, where higher scores indicate a stronger tendency to favor specific regions. Experimental results reveal substantial variation in bias levels across models, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting the highest bias score (9.5) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scoring the lowest (2.5). These findings indicate that regional bias can meaningfully undermine the reliability, fairness, and inclusivity of LLM outputs in real-world, cross-cultural applications. This work contributes to AI fairness research by highlighting the importance of inclusive evaluation frameworks and systematic approaches for identifying and mitigating geographic biases in language models.

*Suhong Moon,Minwoo Kang,Joseph Suh,Mustafa Safdari,John Canny*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how large language models (LLMs) simulate human behavior in social dilemma games by using extended identity-based contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance how LLMs replicate human identity-based decision-making in social dilemma scenarios, improving the fidelity of simulations.

Method: Integrating extended backstories into LLMs for deeper binding, examining simulation fidelity versus human studies, and using instruction-tuned models for consistency checks. Contextual aspects like time and framing are considered.

Result: LLMs conditioned with rich identity narratives show higher simulation accuracy and can model various contextual factors impacting human studies.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable tools for reflecting human-like behaviors and studying factors often ignored in experimental conditions, ensuring better replication of human studies.

Abstract: Humans act via a nuanced process that depends both on rational deliberation and also on identity and contextual factors. In this work, we study how large language models (LLMs) can simulate human action in the context of social dilemma games. While prior work has focused on "steering" (weak binding) of chat models to simulate personas, we analyze here how deep binding of base models with extended backstories leads to more faithful replication of identity-based behaviors. Our study has these findings: simulation fidelity vs human studies is improved by conditioning base LMs with rich context of narrative identities and checking consistency using instruction-tuned models. We show that LLMs can also model contextual factors such as time (year that a study was performed), question framing, and participant pool effects. LLMs, therefore, allow us to explore the details that affect human studies but which are often omitted from experiment descriptions, and which hamper accurate replication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a closed-loop framework using an LLM-powered system for early-stage polymer discovery, combining property prediction, new structure generation, and modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate polymer discovery for various industries by addressing the inefficiencies of trial-and-error methods and lack of accessible predictive tools for laboratory researchers.

Method: Developed a terminal-based framework with machine learning and LLM for property prediction, structure generation, and modification, guided by accessibility and complexity scores.

Result: The framework allows for synthetically feasible polymer discovery and provides computational insights for researchers to design viable polymer structures.

Conclusion: The work bridges computational tools and laboratory practices, offering a user-friendly solution for early-stage polymer development and enhancing research efficiency.

Abstract: On-demand Polymer discovery is essential for various industries, ranging from biomedical to reinforcement materials. Experiments with polymers have a long trial-and-error process, leading to long procedures and extensive resources. For these processes, machine learning has accelerated scientific discovery at the property prediction and latent space search fronts. However, laboratory researchers cannot readily access codes and these models to extract individual structures and properties due to infrastructure limitations. We present a closed-loop polymer structure-property predictor integrated in a terminal for early-stage polymer discovery. The framework is powered by LLM reasoning to provide users with property prediction, property-guided polymer structure generation, and structure modification capabilities. The SMILES sequences are guided by the synthetic accessibility score and the synthetic complexity score (SC Score) to ensure that polymer generation is as close as possible to synthetically accessible monomer-level structures. This framework addresses the challenge of generating novel polymer structures for laboratory researchers, thereby providing computational insights into polymer research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLAS, a method that utilizes activation steering to improve multilingual performance in language models, particularly for non-dominant languages, without altering model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance disparities across dominant and non-dominant languages in multilingual language models and enable better utilization of latent multilingual capacities.

Method: A training-free, inference-time approach called Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS) was introduced to modulate neuron activations, improving multilingual performance without modifying model weights.

Result: CLAS achieved average performance improvements of 2.3% in classification (accuracy) and 3.4% in generation (F1 score); it also showed that gains are linked to increased language cluster separation.

Conclusion: Targeted activation steering can improve the performance of multilingual language models for non-dominant languages while maintaining performance for dominant languages, without altering the models' architectures.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet significant performance gaps persist between dominant and non-dominant languages. Prior work attributes this gap to imbalances between shared and language-specific neurons in multilingual representations. We propose Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), a training-free inference-time intervention that selectively modulates neuron activations. We evaluate CLAS on classification and generation benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 2.3% (Acc.) and 3.4% (F1) respectively, while maintaining high-resource language performance. We discover that effective transfer operates through functional divergence rather than strict alignment; performance gains correlate with increased language cluster separation. Our results demonstrate that targeted activation steering can unlock latent multilingual capacity in existing models without modification to model weights.

*Qianqi Yan,Huy Nguyen,Sumana Srivatsa,Hari Bandi,Xin Eric Wang,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework that uses decoder attentions for multimodal source attribution in clinical summarization tasks, aiming for better interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance trustworthy clinical summarization by making it transparent where generated statements originate, addressing the limitations of current attribution methods.

Method: The framework utilizes decoder attentions for attribution without requiring retraining, introducing two strategies: raw image attention and text-based caption modes, to handle both textual and multimodal data sources.

Result: The approach demonstrated improved text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy on clinical datasets such as CliConSummation and MIMIC-CXR, with a 15% F1 score increase over embedding-based baselines.

Conclusion: Attention-guided attribution is a promising and practical solution for interpretable and effective clinical summarization systems, particularly when using lightweight caption-based methods.

Abstract: Trustworthy clinical summarization requires not only fluent generation but also transparency about where each statement comes from. We propose a training-free framework for generation-time source attribution that leverages decoder attentions to directly cite supporting text spans or images, overcoming the limitations of post-hoc or retraining-based methods. We introduce two strategies for multimodal attribution: a raw image mode, which directly uses image patch attentions, and a caption-as-span mode, which substitutes images with generated captions to enable purely text-based alignment. Evaluations on two representative domains: clinician-patient dialogues (CliConSummation) and radiology reports (MIMIC-CXR), show that our approach consistently outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines, improving both text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy (e.g., +15% F1 over embedding baselines). Caption-based attribution achieves competitive performance with raw-image attention while being more lightweight and practical. These findings highlight attention-guided attribution as a promising step toward interpretable and deployable clinical summarization systems.

*Zongwan Cao,Bingbing Wen,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of under-specified visual question answering (VQA) by introducing a model named CoA (Clarify-or-Answer) to decide when to ask clarifying questions and improve VQA accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to tackle the problem of ambiguous and context-dependent real-world VQA, where external information not present in the image often determines the correctness of answers.

Method: The CoA model decides whether clarification is necessary for an image-question pair. If required, it formulates a focused question, integrates the response, and then provides the final answer. A reinforcement learning approach called GRPO-CR optimizes clarification question generation using reward signals for effective disambiguation.

Result: The CoA framework consistently improves VQA accuracy by an average of +15.3 points (83%) over baseline prompting methods across three vision-language models (VLLMs) and three datasets.

Conclusion: Strategically incorporating clarification questions into the VQA pipeline significantly enhances performance, demonstrating the importance of addressing ambiguity in real-world VQA.

Abstract: Real-world visual question answering (VQA) is often context-dependent: an image-question pair may be under-specified, such that the correct answer depends on external information that is not observable in the image. In such cases, directly answering can lead to confident but incorrect predictions. We propose CoA(Clarify-or-Answer), an ask-or-answer agent that separately models the decision to ask or answer, and what to ask if needed. CoA first determines whether clarification is necessary; if so, it asks a single focused question and then incorporates the response to produce the final answer. We introduce CONTEXTCLARIFY with a set of ambiguous VQA questions and the contrast set that is non-ambiguous. We further introduce GRPO-CR (Clarification Reasoning), a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes clarification question generation with multiple reward signals encouraging well-formed, focused, non-trivial questions that resolve ambiguity. Across three VLLMs and three datasets, CoA achieves consistent improvements at both the module and system levels, improving end-to-end VQA accuracy by an average of +15.3 points (83%) over prompting-based baselines

*Toni J. B. Liu,Baran Zadeoğlu,Nicolas Boullé,Raphaël Sarfati,Christopher J. Earls*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Jacobian Scopes, gradient-based methods to attribute token-level causal influence in large language models' predictions, enhancing understanding of their reasoning and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex structure of LLMs with their layers and attention heads makes it difficult to trace which input tokens influence predictions in the model.

Method: The paper proposes Jacobian Scopes, a token-level attribution framework using gradient-based methods that analyze the linearized relations between the final hidden states and inputs. Three variants of Jacobian Scopes are introduced: Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes.

Result: Jacobians Scopes uncover insights into LLM mechanisms in areas like instruction understanding, translation, and time-series forecasting, while revealing implicit biases in models.

Conclusion: Jacobian Scopes offer an interpretable framework for understanding and analyzing LLM predictions, enhancing transparency and exposing biases in model outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make next-token predictions based on clues present in their context, such as semantic descriptions and in-context examples. Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature). Through case studies spanning instruction understanding, translation and in-context learning (ICL), we uncover interesting findings, such as when Jacobian Scopes point to implicit political biases. We believe that our proposed methods also shed light on recently debated mechanisms underlying in-context time-series forecasting. Our code and interactive demonstrations are publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/JacobianScopes.

### [37] [Learning Domain Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Models through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16419)
*Qinglong Cao,Yuntian Chen,Chao Ma,Xiaokang Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inadequacy of injecting domain knowledge into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through text alone for specific domains like remote sensing and medical imaging, and proposes optimization-based domain integration using reinforcement fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited effectiveness of MLLMs in specialized domains where textual domain knowledge fails to improve performance.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge into the learning objective as constraints and reward signals, rather than as descriptive text.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with significant performance improvements on tasks in remote sensing and medical imaging.

Conclusion: Optimization-level integration of domain knowledge is essential for improving MLLM performance in specialized domains, revealing a limitation in relying solely on textual domain information.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal perception and understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.

*Ayako Sato,Hwichan Kim,Zhousi Chen,Masato Mita,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates numerical bias in LLMs used as evaluators and finds that alignment increases this bias, proposing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical bias in LLM evaluators undermines evaluation effectiveness, motivating the study of its causes and potential solutions.

Method: The study compares outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs and tests various mitigation strategies, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment.

Result: Alignment significantly increases numerical bias, and score range adjustment is the most effective mitigation strategy, although still heuristic.

Conclusion: Further research is required to develop optimal score range selection methods and more robust strategies for numerical bias mitigation.

Abstract: ``LLM-as-a-judge,'' which utilizes large language models (LLMs) as evaluators, has proven effective in many evaluation tasks. However, evaluator LLMs exhibit numerical bias, a phenomenon where certain evaluation scores are generated disproportionately often, leading reduced evaluation performance. This study investigates the cause of this bias. Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic. Our findings highlight the need for further work on optimal score range selection and more robust mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoGos, an advanced language model fine-tuned to excel in Go gameplay while preserving general reasoning capabilities, achieving human professional-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific experts, particularly in tasks like Go, where LLMs struggle to achieve proficiency.

Method: The authors used mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and general Chain-of-Thought reasoning data, followed by reinforcement learning, to integrate domain knowledge with reasoning skills.

Result: LoGos demonstrated superior strategic reasoning and next-move prediction in Go, achieving professional-level performance and outperforming all prior LLMs in the domain.

Conclusion: The research bridges the gap between general reasoning abilities of LLMs and domain-specific expertise, and introduces datasets, benchmarks, and models to facilitate specialized domain applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, matching or surpassing human capabilities. However, these impressive reasoning abilities face significant challenges in specialized domains. Taking Go as an example, although AlphaGo has established the high performance ceiling of AI systems in Go, mainstream LLMs still struggle to reach even beginner-level proficiency, let alone perform natural language reasoning. This performance gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain experts is significantly limiting the application of LLMs on a wider range of domain-specific tasks. In this work, we aim to bridge the divide between LLMs' general reasoning capabilities and expert knowledge in domain-specific tasks. We perform mixed fine-tuning with structured Go expertise and general long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data as a cold start, followed by reinforcement learning to integrate expert knowledge in Go with general reasoning capabilities. Through this methodology, we present \textbf{LoGos}, a powerful LLM that not only maintains outstanding general reasoning abilities, but also conducts Go gameplay in natural language, demonstrating effective strategic reasoning and accurate next-move prediction. LoGos achieves performance comparable to human professional players, substantially surpassing all existing LLMs. Through this work, we aim to contribute insights on applying general LLM reasoning capabilities to specialized domains. We will release the first large-scale Go dataset for LLM training, the first LLM Go evaluation benchmark, and the first general LLM that reaches human professional-level performance in Go at: https://github.com/Entarochuan/LoGos.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraphAnchor, a novel approach for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by using graph-anchored knowledge indexing to enhance information synthesis and mitigate hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems struggle with effectively synthesizing key evidence scattered across noisy documents, leading to challenges in reducing hallucinations.

Method: The paper proposes GraphAnchor, which incrementally updates a graph structure during iterative retrieval to anchor important information. This structured graph index guides LLMs in assessing knowledge sufficiency and generating better subqueries.

Result: Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAnchor improves RAG by focusing LLM attention on key information spread across retrieved documents.

Conclusion: GraphAnchor provides a more structured and effective method for integrating external knowledge, enabling better retrieval and reasoning in LLMs, as evidenced by improved performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Nevertheless, effectively integrating and interpreting key evidence scattered across noisy documents remains a critical challenge for existing RAG systems. In this paper, we propose GraphAnchor, a novel Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing approach that reconceptualizes graph structures from static knowledge representations into active, evolving knowledge indices. GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, PHISH, that can manipulate Large Language Model (LLM) personas by embedding cues into user history, exposing new vulnerabilities in safety and reliability for sensitive applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the oversight in studies on how adversarial conversational history impacts LLM personas, especially needed for reliable functioning in sensitive domains.

Method: Propose the PHISH framework for adversarial persona editing using user-side inputs under a black-box inference-only setting. Quantify attack success and test across benchmarks and models.

Result: PHISH successfully manipulates personas across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, impacting correlated traits and maintaining high reasoning performance while manipulating personas.

Conclusion: Robust and context-resilient persona guardrails are necessary to mitigate vulnerabilities exposed by PHISH for the safe deployment of LLMs in high-risk domains. Code and dataset are made publicly available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as education, mental health and customer support, where stable and consistent personas are critical for reliability. Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the vulnerability of existing retrieval methods to semantically similar yet logically irrelevant passages, which compromise factual reliability and lead to amplification of errors in scientific question answering.

Method: The authors propose DeepEra, a method incorporating step-by-step reasoning for clearer evaluation of candidate passages. They also introduce SciRAG-SSLI, a dataset of 300K SciQA instances designed to evaluate robustness against logically irrelevant data.

Result: DeepEra outperforms existing reranking methods in retrieval effectiveness, showcasing enhanced logical robustness and factual grounding in addressing scientific questions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing semantically similar but logically irrelevant challenges in retrieval methods, demonstrating DeepEra's success and introducing a valuable dataset for further evaluation in SciQA.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of scientific literature, scientific question answering (SciQA) has become increasingly critical for exploring and utilizing scientific knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating knowledge from external sources, thereby providing credible evidence for scientific question answering. But existing retrieval and reranking methods remain vulnerable to passages that are semantically similar but logically irrelevant, often reducing factual reliability and amplifying hallucinations.To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Evidence Reranking Agent (DeepEra) that integrates step-by-step reasoning, enabling more precise evaluation of candidate passages beyond surface-level semantics. To support systematic evaluation, we construct SciRAG-SSLI (Scientific RAG - Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant), a large-scale dataset comprising about 300K SciQA instances across 10 subjects, constructed from 10M scientific corpus. The dataset combines naturally retrieved contexts with systematically generated distractors to test logical robustness and factual grounding. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that our approach achieves superior retrieval performance compared to leading rerankers. To our knowledge, this work is the first to comprehensively study and empirically validate innegligible SSLI issues in two-stage RAG frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TL-GRPO, a new RL algorithm for fine-grained optimization tasks, demonstrating superior performance in analog circuit sizing compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL algorithms like GRPO struggle with iterative optimization tasks where only turn-level rewards matter, requiring a solution that can effectively handle these scenarios without losing reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight algorithm that utilizes turn-level group sampling to achieve fine-grained optimization.

Result: TL-GRPO outperformed both standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization in analog circuit sizing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under the same simulation budget with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: TL-GRPO represents an advancement in optimizing iterative reasoning tasks and showcases practical utility in complex scientific domains, setting a new standard in analog circuit sizing.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in complex tasks through tool integration, which is typically framed as a Markov Decision Process and optimized with trajectory-level RL algorithms such as GRPO. However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization. We evaluate TL-GRPO on analog circuit sizing (ACS), a challenging scientific optimization task requiring multiple simulations and domain expertise. Results show that TL-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO and Bayesian optimization methods across various specifications. Furthermore, our 30B model trained with TL-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACS tasks under same simulation budget, demonstrating both strong generalization and practical utility.

Motivation: The need to optimize large language models' capabilities during test-time, especially in situations involving frequent tool usage and varying tool latency, necessitates a more dynamic approach than traditional methods that rely solely on generation length.

Method: This paper proposes redefining test-time as wall-clock time, introduces the Timely-Eval benchmark for various tool call and reasoning scenarios, and develops Timely-RL which uses reinforcement learning to improve models' adaptability to time constraints.

Result: The study reveals that smaller models perform better in fast feedback scenarios with frequent interactions, while larger models excel in high-latency contexts. Existing models struggle with time budget adaptation, which is improved by Timely-RL.

Conclusion: Timely-RL significantly improves reasoning and performance within time budgets, highlighting the importance of a wall-clock time-based approach and offering a new perspective for test-time scaling in the agentic era.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly tackle complex reasoning tasks, test-time scaling has become critical for enhancing capabilities. However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval. We hope our work offers a new perspective on test-time scaling for the agentic era.

*Wei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MRAG benchmark for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the medical domain and demonstrates the influence of various RAG components on task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for RAG systems in the medical domain has been identified due to its increasing adoption in scientific and clinical QA, yet existing benchmarks are lacking.

Method: The authors present the MRAG benchmark covering English and Chinese tasks using a corpus built from Wikipedia and Pubmed and offer the MRAG-Toolkit to explore different RAG components systematically.

Result: They observe that RAG improves LLM reliability and reasoning quality but can slightly reduce readability for long-form questions; task performance also depends on retrieval techniques, model size, and prompting methods.

Conclusion: The MRAG benchmark and toolkit promise valuable contributions to academia and industry, and their release under an open license will broaden accessibility for further development.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been swiftly adopted in scientific and clinical QA systems, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark in the medical domain is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce the Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) benchmark, covering various tasks in English and Chinese languages, and building a corpus with Wikipedia and Pubmed. Additionally, we develop the MRAG-Toolkit, facilitating systematic exploration of different RAG components. Our experiments reveal that: (a) RAG enhances LLM reliability across MRAG tasks. (b) the performance of RAG systems is influenced by retrieval approaches, model sizes, and prompting strategies. (c) While RAG improves usefulness and reasoning quality, LLM responses may become slightly less readable for long-form questions. We will release the MRAG-Bench's dataset and toolkit with CCBY-4.0 license upon acceptance, to facilitate applications from both academia and industry.

*Obed Junias,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, a benchmark highlighting commonsense reasoning as compositional tasks instead of single-label decisions, revealing models' weaknesses in negation-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for commonsense reasoning often fail to address scenarios requiring evaluation of multiple plausible outcomes or logical reasoning, thus obscuring a comprehensive analysis of model capabilities.

Method: The authors propose LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, a new benchmark that involves logical composition of plausibility using operators such as AND, OR, and NEITHER/NOR. Various models are tested under different setups including zero-shot and few-shot prompting.

Result: Models perform adequately on conjunctive reasoning, moderately on disjunctive reasoning, but show significant drops in performance on negation-based reasoning within the benchmark.

Conclusion: LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA serves as a means to identify and improve critical gaps in compositional commonsense reasoning tasks for AI models.

Abstract: Commonsense reasoning often involves evaluating multiple plausible interpretations rather than selecting a single atomic answer, yet most benchmarks rely on single-label evaluation, obscuring whether statements are jointly plausible, mutually exclusive, or jointly implausible. We introduce LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA, a benchmark that re-frames commonsense reasoning as logical composition over pairs of atomic statements using plausibility-level operators (AND, OR, NEITHER/NOR). Evaluating instruction-tuned, reasoning-specialized, and fine-tuned models under zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, we find that while models perform reasonably on conjunctive and moderately on disjunctive reasoning, performance degrades sharply on negation-based questions. LOGICAL-COMMONSENSEQA exposes fundamental reasoning limitations and provides a controlled framework for advancing compositional commonsense reasoning.

*Karl Neergaard,Le Qiu,Emmanuele Chersoni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores LLM evaluation beyond single-prompt tests by assessing conversational settings, revealing dynamic vulnerabilities inherent in multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-prompt tests overlook the conversational dynamics where LLMs encounter veracity challenges with potential real-world harms.

Method: Performance of LLMs is evaluated using the BoolQ dataset with variations in conversation length and scaffolding conditions.

Result: The study finds LLM-specific vulnerabilities that are not detectable through static, single-turn evaluations.

Conclusion: Static single-prompt evaluations cannot capture critical conversational weaknesses, highlighting the need for multi-turn interaction testing in LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Single-prompt evaluations dominate current LLM benchmarking, yet they fail to capture the conversational dynamics where real-world harm occurs. In this study, we examined whether conversation length affects response veracity by evaluating LLM performance on the BoolQ dataset under varying length and scaffolding conditions. Our results across three distinct LLMs revealed model-specific vulnerabilities that are invisible under single-turn testing. The length-dependent and scaffold-specific effects we observed demonstrate a fundamental limitation of static evaluations, as deployment-relevant vulnerabilities could only be spotted in a multi-turn conversational setting.

*Hoang-Quoc Nguyen-Son,Minh-Son Dao,Koji Zettsu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SearchLLM, a proxy tool designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by using search engine capabilities to compare input with potential original sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users rely on LLMs to improve textual quality, but paraphrasing by LLMs may distort original meanings, making detection challenging due to human-like characteristics of LLM-generated text.

Method: SearchLLM leverages search engines to locate original text sources and analyzes similarities between input and regenerated candidate sources using proxy layer integration with existing detectors.

Result: Experimental results show that SearchLLM enhances accuracy of current detectors and improves their ability to detect LLM-paraphrased text, even under paraphrasing attacks.

Conclusion: SearchLLM is effective in identifying LLM-paraphrased content, strengthening detectors, and addressing distortions in meaning caused by paraphrasing.

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), it has become common practice for users to draft text and utilize LLMs to enhance its quality through paraphrasing. However, this process can sometimes result in the loss or distortion of the original intended meaning. Due to the human-like quality of LLM-generated text, traditional detection methods often fail, particularly when text is paraphrased to closely mimic original content. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach named SearchLLM, designed to identify LLM-paraphrased text by leveraging search engine capabilities to locate potential original text sources. By analyzing similarities between the input and regenerated versions of candidate sources, SearchLLM effectively distinguishes LLM-paraphrased content. SearchLLM is designed as a proxy layer, allowing seamless integration with existing detectors to enhance their performance. Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate that SearchLLM consistently enhances the accuracy of recent detectors in detecting LLM-paraphrased text that closely mimics original content. Furthermore, SearchLLM also helps the detectors prevent paraphrasing attacks.

*Gaurav Maheshwari,Kevin El Haddad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to train lightweight text classifiers using training data dynamically generated by LLMs, achieving better results without the high cost of large-model deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and practical deployment of zero and few-shot classifiers arising from the high inference cost and latency issues of large language models.

Method: The method involves an iterative process where an LLM curates and refines training data based on model successes and errors, enhancing data quality tailored to specific classifiers and tasks.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms zero and few-shot baselines across four widely-used benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively act as data curators, enabling accurate and efficient text classification while reducing reliance on large-model deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and high-capacity encoders have advanced zero and few-shot classification, but their inference cost and latency limit practical deployment. We propose training lightweight text classifiers using dynamically generated supervision from an LLM. Our method employs an iterative, agentic loop in which the LLM curates training data, analyzes model successes and failures, and synthesizes targeted examples to address observed errors. This closed-loop generation and evaluation process progressively improves data quality and adapts it to the downstream classifier and task. Across four widely used benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms standard zero and few-shot baselines. These results indicate that LLMs can serve effectively as data curators, enabling accurate and efficient classification without the operational cost of large-model deployment.

*Mingwei Sun,Qianlong Wang,Ruifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate framework for fact-checking based on large language models to improve verification accuracy by eliminating irrelevant information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The decomposition paradigm in fact-checking introduces noise due to irrelevant entities and evidence, degrading verification accuracy.

Method: The proposed Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework works by identifying claim entities, retrieving relevant evidence, refining evidence, and calibrating low-confidence predictions.

Result: Experiments on HOVER and FEVEROUS-S datasets demonstrate superior performance of the RRC framework compared to competitive baselines.

Conclusion: The RRC framework effectively addresses noise in fact-checking, improving verification precision and reliability with large language model integration.

Abstract: Fact-checking aims to verify the truthfulness of a claim based on the retrieved evidence. Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified. However, the decomposition paradigm may introduce noise to the verification process due to irrelevant entities or evidence, ultimately degrading verification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions. Experiments on two popular fact-checking datasets (HOVER and FEVEROUS-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared with competitive baselines.

*Jianyu Wen,Yang Wei,Xiongxi Yu,Changxuan Xiao,Ke Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Attention-MoA, a framework enhancing collaboration in LLMs via Inter-agent Semantic Attention and an Inter-layer Residual Module, improving efficiency, semantic accuracy, and outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Mixture-of-Agents frameworks for LLMs face inefficiencies and lack sufficient mechanisms for semantic improvement, correction of hallucinations, and logical refinement during model collaboration.

Method: The paper introduces 'Attention-MoA,' which employs Inter-agent Semantic Attention, an Inter-layer Residual Module, and an Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism to enhance collaborative semantic interactions and computational efficiency.

Result: Evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK, show superior performance over existing methods. Attention-MoA enables small open-source model ensembles to surpass proprietary models like GPT-4.1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet in both score and semantic capabilities.

Conclusion: Attention-MoA breaks barriers in collaborative LLM efficiency and capability, proving that intelligently layered, smaller models can outperform massive proprietary ones, advancing the scalability and accessibility of LLM solutions.

Abstract: As the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts from parameter scaling to inference-time collaboration, the Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) framework has emerged as a general paradigm to harness collective intelligence by layering diverse models. While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AuroraEdge-V-2B, a compact VLLM optimized for edge deployment. It balances performance, speed, and cost-efficiency in industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of VLLMs in industrial environments, such as computational demands, slower speeds, and domain-specific performance gaps.

Method: The researchers propose a compressed and fusion-based approach alongside designing AuroraEdge-V-2B for edge-friendly deployment with only 2B parameters.

Result: AuroraEdge-V-2B demonstrated superior real-time performance, reduced inference costs by halving floating-point operations, and outperformed similar models on 9 benchmarks.

Conclusion: AuroraEdge-V-2B effectively overcomes drawbacks of previous VLLMs for industrial applications, delivering robustness, efficiency, and strong performance at lower resource consumption.

Abstract: Recently, due to the advancement of multimodal technology, people are attempting to use visual large language models (VLLMs) in industrial production. Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use. (3) Strong performance: It gets a higher score on 9 benchmarks than models with the same number of parameter (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, InternVL-2.5-2B).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PROST-LLM, a method to enhance Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by utilizing tri-task learning, chain of modality methods, and preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored application of LLMs to S2ST and overcome challenges like data scarcity in this domain.

Method: The authors propose a three-step method: 1) Fine-tuning LLMs using the CVSS corpus with tri-task learning and chain of modality techniques, 2) Generating preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation, 3) Using these pairs for preference optimization.

Result: Experiments substantiate that PROST-LLM significantly enhances the S2ST capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings confirm that the proposed PROST-LLM framework effectively improves S2ST tasks and mitigates data scarcity challenges without relying on human evaluations.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, their application to Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) is underexplored and hindered by data scarcity. To bridge this gap, we propose PROST-LLM (PROgressive Speech-to-speech Translation) to enhance the S2ST capabilities in LLMs progressively. First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance. Then, leveraging the fine-tuned model, we generate preference pairs through self-sampling and back-translation without human evaluation. Finally, these preference pairs are used for preference optimization to enhance the model's S2ST capability further. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed PROST-LLM in improving the S2ST capability of LLMs.

*Xueyang Feng,Weinan Gan,Xu Chen,Quanyu Dai,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of irrational personalization in large language model-powered assistants and introduces a benchmark (RPEval) alongside a novel method (RP-Reasoner) to selectively utilize memory for better user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the issue where irrelevant personalized memories interfere with intent understanding by LLM-powered assistants, negatively impacting user experience.

Method: The authors develop RPEval, a benchmark combining a personalized intent reasoning dataset with a multi-granularity evaluation protocol, and propose RP-Reasoner, a reasoning process to selectively integrate personalized information.

Result: RP-Reasoner outperforms carefully designed baselines, successfully resolving 80% of issues observed in a commercial assistant, highlighting its efficacy in mitigating irrational personalization.

Conclusion: Pragmatic reasoning, as implemented in RP-Reasoner, shows significant promise in improving the personalization process of LLMs and enhancing user experience. The benchmark (RPEval) is open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered assistants have recently integrated memory mechanisms that record user preferences, leading to more personalized and user-aligned responses. However, irrelevant personalized memories are often introduced into the context, interfering with the LLM's intent understanding. To comprehensively investigate the dual effects of personalization, we develop RPEval, a benchmark comprising a personalized intent reasoning dataset and a multi-granularity evaluation protocol. RPEval reveals the widespread phenomenon of irrational personalization in existing LLMs and, through error pattern analysis, illustrates its negative impact on user experience. Finally, we introduce RP-Reasoner, which treats memory utilization as a pragmatic reasoning process, enabling the selective integration of personalized information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms carefully designed baselines on RPEval, and resolves 80% of the bad cases observed in a large-scale commercial personalized assistant, highlighting the potential of pragmatic reasoning to mitigate irrational personalization. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/XueyangFeng/RPEval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of processing social media text in NLP by transforming data through lexical normalization. It extends the MultiLexNorm benchmark to cover five Asian languages in four scripts, introduces a new LLM-based architecture, and identifies areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve NLP model performance on social media text, which is challenging due to informal language usage. Current benchmarks for lexical normalization lack diverse linguistic representation, particularly outside the Indo-European language family.

Method: The authors propose an extension to the MultiLexNorm benchmark to include five Asian languages with different scripts and develop a new LLM-based architecture for more robust lexical normalization.

Result: The new LLM-based architecture demonstrates improved robustness compared to previous state-of-the-art models, particularly on the newly added languages and scripts.

Conclusion: The extended benchmark and novel LLM method significantly advance lexical normalization research for non-Indo-European languages. Future work should address the analyzed errors for further improvement.

Abstract: Social media data has been of interest to Natural Language Processing (NLP) practitioners for over a decade, because of its richness in information, but also challenges for automatic processing. Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script. Hence, we propose an extension to MultiLexNorm, which covers 5 Asian languages from different language families in 4 different scripts. We show that the previous state-of-the-art model performs worse on the new languages and propose a new architecture based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which shows more robust performance. Finally, we analyze remaining errors, revealing future directions for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massively multilingual language models struggle with low-resource and unseen languages, and training language-specific adapters is resource-intensive.

Method: TIPA aggregates existing language adapters based on typological similarity without requiring additional training, and integrates into the MAD-X framework for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.

Result: TIPA outperforms or matches baselines in five NLP tasks across 230+ languages, showing significant improvements for languages without dedicated adapters.

Conclusion: TIPA demonstrates that typologically informed parameter aggregation is an effective and efficient alternative to training language-specific modules.

Abstract: Massively multilingual language models enable cross-lingual generalization but underperform on low-resource and unseen languages. While adapter-based fine-tuning offers a parameter-efficient solution, training language-specific adapters at scale remains costly. We introduce Typologically Informed Parameter Aggregation (TIPA), a training-free method that constructs proxy language adapters by aggregating existing ones, weighted by typological similarity. Integrated into the MAD-X framework, these proxies enable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer without additional training. We evaluate TIPA on five NLP tasks and over 230 languages. TIPA consistently outperforms or matches baselines such as English-only fine-tuning or selecting the typologically closest language adapter. We see the largest gains for languages lacking dedicated adapters. Our results demonstrate that typologically informed aggregation provides a viable alternative to language-specific modules without any training needed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and mitigates sycophancy signals in multi-head attention activations through linear probes, showing transferability to factual QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the phenomenon of sycophancy in large language models by identifying where sycophancy-related signals emerge in the model architecture.

Method: By leveraging the linear representation hypothesis, the authors trained linear probes on various layers (residual stream, MLPs, and attention layers) to identify separable sycophancy signals. They further conducted attention pattern analysis to explore the behavior of specific attention heads.

Result: Sycophancy signals were most separable in middle-layer attention heads. Probes trained on TruthfulQA were transferable to other QA benchmarks. Attention heads contributing to sycophancy disproportionately focused on user doubt.

Conclusion: Sycophancy can be addressed with simple, targeted linear interventions exploiting the internal geometry of attention activations, which hold promise for improving factual accuracy and resistance to user deference.

Abstract: We find that correct-to-incorrect sycophancy signals are most linearly separable within multi-head attention activations. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified "truthful" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms. Attention-pattern analysis further indicates that the influential heads attend disproportionately to expressions of user doubt, contributing to sycophantic shifts. Overall, these findings suggest that sycophancy can be mitigated through simple, targeted linear interventions that exploit the internal geometry of attention activations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares two methods for reducing dimensionality in gradient-based explanations of large language models (LLMs) and proposes a targeted component selection approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based attribution methods for large language models are challenging due to the high dimensionality of model gradients. Optimizing these methods is crucial for retrieving training data efficiently.

Method: The paper evaluates low-dimensional representations by comparing architecturally informed subset selection of model parameters and random projection of full gradients, using a novel benchmark for assessing training data influence.

Result: The study finds that selecting components informed by model architecture captures information about training data influence more effectively than using full gradients or random projection. It also provides computational efficiency benefits.

Conclusion: Targeted component selection is a practical and efficient strategy for instance-based explanations of large language models, outperforming alternative dimensionality reduction techniques.

Abstract: Gradient-based methods for instance-based explanation for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by the immense dimensionality of model gradients. In practice, influence estimation is restricted to a subset of model parameters to make computation tractable, but this subset is often chosen ad hoc and rarely justified by systematic evaluation. This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection. We further find that this approach is more computationally efficient than random projection, demonstrating that targeted component selection is a practical strategy for making instance-based explanations of large models more computationally feasible.

TL;DR: PLawBench is introduced as a new benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on realistic legal scenarios, revealing limitations in their fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current legal LLM benchmarks fail to capture the real-world complexity, ambiguity, and fine-grained reasoning requirements of legal practice.

Method: PLawBench evaluates LLMs through three task categories—public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation—using 850 questions across 13 scenarios with detailed expert-designed rubrics.

Result: Evaluation of 10 state-of-the-art LLMs shows no strong performance, revealing limited ability in fine-grained legal reasoning.

Conclusion: PLawBench highlights significant limitations of current LLMs in legal tasks and suggests pathways for improvement in legal-specific AI development.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMemBench is a long-term memory benchmark for agents using dynamic game-based questioning across text and visual environments, revealing memory challenges especially in spatial/visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack robust evaluation of agent memory capabilities. EMemBench aims to address this gap by using dynamic and interactive games.

Method: Interactive questions are generated from the agent’s trajectory across text and visual environments, covering various memory skills. Agents with LMs/VLMs are benchmarked, alongside human studies.

Result: Induction and spatial reasoning pose challenges for agents, with consistent improvements in text-based games but inconsistent performance in visual settings.

Conclusion: EMemBench is a challenging benchmark for memory evaluation, especially in visually grounded environments, emphasizing open research areas in episodic memory.

Abstract: We introduce EMemBench, a programmatic benchmark for evaluating long-term memory of agents through interactive games. Rather than using a fixed set of questions, EMemBench generates questions from each agent's own trajectory, covering both text and visual game environments. Each template computes verifiable ground truth from underlying game signals, with controlled answerability and balanced coverage over memory skills: single/multi-hop recall, induction, temporal, spatial, logical, and adversarial. We evaluate memory agents with strong LMs/VLMs as backbones, using in-context prompting as baselines. Across 15 text games and multiple visual seeds, results are far from saturated: induction and spatial reasoning are persistent bottlenecks, especially in visual setting. Persistent memory yields clear gains for open backbones on text games, but improvements are less consistent for VLM agents, suggesting that visually grounded episodic memory remains an open challenge. A human study further confirms the difficulty of EMemBench.

*Shanshan Liu,Noriki Nishida,Fei Cheng,Narumi Tokunaga,Rumana Ferdous Munne,Yuki Yamagata,Kouji Kozaki,Takehito Utsuro,Yuji Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses generalization challenges in Mention-agnostic Biomedical Concept Recognition (MA-BCR) using an evaluation framework and auto-labeled data generated by large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of human annotations in MA-BCR limits the ability to generalize to unseen biomedical concepts, prompting the need for alternative scalable approaches.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical evaluation framework and novel metrics. It also creates a task-specific pipeline to generate LLM-based auto-labeled data (ALD) as a scalable resource.

Result: The research demonstrates that LLM-based ALD enhances model generalization by providing broader coverage and structural knowledge, though it doesn't fully replace manual annotations.

Conclusion: LLM-generated ALD is a valuable tool for addressing the scarcity of annotations and improving generalization in MA-BCR, though manual annotations still remain essential.

Abstract: Generalization to unseen concepts is a central challenge due to the scarcity of human annotations in Mention-agnostic Biomedical Concept Recognition (MA-BCR). This work makes two key contributions to systematically address this issue. First, we propose an evaluation framework built on hierarchical concept indices and novel metrics to measure generalization. Second, we explore LLM-based Auto-Labeled Data (ALD) as a scalable resource, creating a task-specific pipeline for its generation. Our research unequivocally shows that while LLM-generated ALD cannot fully substitute for manual annotations, it is a valuable resource for improving generalization, successfully providing models with the broader coverage and structural knowledge needed to approach recognizing unseen concepts.

### [62] [Mitigating Bias in Automated Grading Systems for ESL Learners: A Contrastive Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16724)
*Kevin Fan,Eric Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses algorithmic bias in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems against high-proficiency English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, revealing a scoring disparity and proposing a contrastive learning approach to mitigate the bias while preserving the model's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address algorithmic bias in AES systems, particularly in high-stakes settings, where ESL learners' essays are scored unfairly compared to native speakers.

Method: The research fine-tunes a DeBERTa-v3 model with Contrastive Learning using a triplet construction strategy and a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs. The model uses Triplet Margin Loss to align representations of ESL and native speaker essays.

Result: Their method reduced the scoring disparity for high-proficiency ESL essays by 39.9%, from 10.3% to 6.2%, while maintaining a QWK of 0.76.

Conclusion: By introducing a contrastive learning approach, the bias in scoring ESL essays was reduced significantly while preventing penalties for correct L2 syntactic structures. The study highlights a promising way to ensure fairness in AES systems for diverse linguistic groups.

Abstract: As Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are increasingly used in high-stakes educational settings, concerns regarding algorithmic bias against English as a Second Language (ESL) learners have increased. Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76. Post-hoc linguistic analysis suggests the model successfully disentangled sentence complexity from grammatical error, preventing the penalization of valid L2 syntactic structures.

### [63] [Standardizing Longitudinal Radiology Report Evaluation via Large Language Model Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16753)
*Xinyi Wang,Grazziela Figueredo,Ruizhe Li,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new pipeline using large language models (LLMs) is introduced for automatically annotating longitudinal information in radiology reports to better evaluate and compare report generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tools for consistently labeling temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons, especially as current methods are labor-intensive and insufficient.

Method: Proposing an LLM-based pipeline that identifies relevant longitudinal information in radiology reports and extracts disease progression. Evaluation is performed with 500 manually annotated reports using five LLMs, selecting Qwen2.5-32B, and further annotating 95,169 reports from the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing solutions with 11.3% and 5.3% higher F1 scores for longitudinal information detection and disease progression tracking, respectively. The Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset is standardized as a benchmark.

Conclusion: An automated LLM-based annotation pipeline improves the evaluation of radiology report generation models by providing a consistent and high-performing method for identifying temporal changes and disease progression in reports.

Abstract: Longitudinal information in radiology reports refers to the sequential tracking of findings across multiple examinations over time, which is crucial for monitoring disease progression and guiding clinical decisions. Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models. Our LLM-based annotation method outperforms existing annotation solutions, achieving 11.3\% and 5.3\% higher F1-scores for longitudinal information detection and disease tracking, respectively.

### [64] [Do LLM hallucination detectors suffer from low-resource effect?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16766)
*Debtanu Datta,Mohan Kishore Chilukuri,Yash Kumar,Saptarshi Ghosh,Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates two failure modes of large language models (LLMs)—hallucinations and performance degradation in low-resource languages—and studies whether hallucination detectors are affected by the latter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how hallucination detectors perform in low-resource languages and whether LLMs' internal mechanisms encode uncertainty signals robustly despite language resource limitations.

Method: Experiments were conducted on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities), using four LLMs and three hallucination detectors to analyze performance in English and low-resource languages.

Result: Task accuracies in low-resource languages dropped significantly compared to English, but the accuracy drop for hallucination detectors was often much smaller, implying effective encoding of uncertainty signals by LLMs.

Conclusion: Hallucination detectors show robustness in tasks within a language and in multilingual setups, but require in-language supervision for cross-lingual application. LLMs might retain uncertainty signals even in low-resource languages.

Abstract: LLMs, while outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks, can still fail in unanticipated ways. We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty. Further, the detectors are robust within language (even for non-English) and in multilingual setups, but not in cross-lingual settings without in-language supervision.

### [65] [Persuasion Tokens for Editing Factual Knowledge in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16781)
*Paul Youssef,Jörg Schlötterer,Christin Seifert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method called persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) as an efficient approach for knowledge editing in Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring lengthy fact-specific demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of in-context knowledge editing (IKE), which is costly due to its reliance on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations and consumes significant context window space in LLMs.

Method: The proposed method involves training special tokens called persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) to replicate the effects of IKE demonstrations without needing specific examples for each fact.

Result: The study shows that P-Tokens achieve comparable or better performance than IKE across multiple datasets and LLMs, are robust to distractors, and achieve higher performance with an increased number of tokens.

Conclusion: P-Tokens offer a practical and scalable solution for editing LLMs, reducing the dependency on costly demonstrations and addressing key IKE limitations.

Abstract: In-context knowledge editing (IKE) is a promising technique for updating Large Language Models (LLMs) with new information. However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance. Our work addresses key limitations of IKE and provides a more practical and scalable alternative for editing LLMs.

### [66] [Large Language Models as Automatic Annotators and Annotation Adjudicators for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16800)
*Gaurav Negi,MA Waskow,Paul Buitelaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates using large language models (LLMs) as automatic annotators to enhance fine-grained opinion analysis, using a structured annotation pipeline to reduce manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of annotating detailed opinion datasets across diverse domains, which is labor-intensive and expensive.

Method: A declarative annotation pipeline was developed, allowing LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans with reduced manual prompt variability. Additionally, a new methodology enables LLMs to adjudicate and finalize multiple annotation labels.

Result: LLMs were tested on Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment tasks, achieving high inter-annotator agreement among models of different sizes.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as both annotators and adjudicators for fine-grained opinion analysis, reducing costs and minimizing human effort in dataset creation.

Abstract: Fine-grained opinion analysis of text provides a detailed understanding of expressed sentiments, including the addressed entity. Although this level of detail is sound, it requires considerable human effort and substantial cost to annotate opinions in datasets for training models, especially across diverse domains and real-world applications. We explore the feasibility of LLMs as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, addressing the shortage of domain-specific labelled datasets. In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text. We also present a novel methodology for an LLM to adjudicate multiple labels and produce final annotations. After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators. This reduces the cost and human effort needed to create these fine-grained opinion-annotated datasets.

### [67] [SoS: Analysis of Surface over Semantics in Multilingual Text-To-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16803)
*Carolin Holtermann,Florian Schneider,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the tendency of text-to-image (T2I) models to prioritize language surface forms over semantic understanding, resulting in culturally stereotypical outputs, by analyzing seven models across 14 languages and 171 cultural identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive evaluation of T2I models' 'Surface-over-Semantics' (SoS) behavior, where these models prioritize input language surface forms over the semantic meaning, leading to culturally stereotypical outputs.

Method: The authors created a set of prompts based on 171 cultural identities in 14 languages and tested them on seven T2I models to examine their SoS tendencies. They developed a novel quantification metric to evaluate how these tendencies appear across models, languages, and cultures.

Result: All but one T2I model showed significant surface-level tendencies in at least two languages, with this tendency increasing across T2I text encoder layers. These tendencies also frequently aligned with stereotypical cultural visual depictions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the biases in T2I models, emphasizing the need for improvements in multilingual and culturally contextual understanding to mitigate stereotypical and surface-level tendencies.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly employed by users worldwide. However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually. We show that all but one model exhibit strong surface-level tendency in at least two languages, with this effect intensifying across the layers of T2I text encoders. Moreover, these surface tendencies frequently correlate with stereotypical visual depictions.

*Leonard S. Pleiss,Maximilian Schiffer,Robert K. von Weizsäcker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) using chess as a test case, revealing a decline in performance for novel scenarios requiring fluid intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the balance between LLMs' crystallized intelligence (recall) and fluid intelligence (reasoning ability) and exploring their limitations in systematic generalization.

Method: The authors utilize chess positions with varying familiarity to LLM training sets. They evaluate GPT models across these positions to analyze performance based on reasoning demands.

Result: Performance decreases as fluid intelligence demands increase, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Better reasoning improves results but with diminishing value as tasks become novel.

Conclusion: Current LLM architectures struggle with systematic generalization, requiring advancements beyond scaling to enhance fluid intelligence capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution. Furthermore, while reasoning-augmented inference improves performance, its marginal benefit per token decreases with distributional proximity. These results suggest current architectures remain limited in systematic generalization, highlighting the need for mechanisms beyond scale to achieve robust fluid intelligence.

*João A. Leite,Olesya Razuvayevskaya,Kalina Bontcheva,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new type of adversarial attack on automated fact-checking systems using persuasion techniques and analyzes the significant impact on system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated fact-checking systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks but prior frameworks have not explored leveraging persuasion techniques, which are prominent in disinformation campaigns.

Method: A generative LLM is deployed to rephrase claims into more persuasive forms based on 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories. These rephrased claims are then tested on AFC systems using a decoupled evaluation method.

Result: Experiments conducted on the FEVER and FEVEROUS datasets demonstrate that persuasion attacks noticeably reduce the performance of both verification and evidence retrieval subsystems.

Conclusion: Persuasion-based attacks represent a serious threat to AFC systems, emphasizing the urgency of developing more resilient algorithms.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking (AFC) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, enabling false claims to evade detection. Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.

*Elias Schuhmacher,Andrianos Michail,Juri Opitz,Rico Sennrich,Simon Clematide*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses biases in embedding-based search processes, which disadvantage later document segments and lower-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to ensure fair representation of all document segments and languages in embedding-based search processes, addressing biases that compromise discoverability.

Method: The authors introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework to quantify biases and propose an inference-time attention calibration method to redistribute attention across document segments more evenly.

Result: The study reveals systematic biases favoring early segments and higher-resource languages in embedding models, and demonstrates that attention calibration improves discoverability of later segments.

Conclusion: Embedding models can exhibit biases in document representation, but these can be mitigated by attention calibration to enhance fairness and discoverability across all document parts.

Abstract: To be discoverable in an embedding-based search process, each part of a document should be reflected in its embedding representation. To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments. Our evaluation framework and attention calibration is available at https://github.com/impresso/fair-sentence-transformers

*Danil Semin,Ondřej Dušek,Zdeněk Kasner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LogitMatch, a method for improved span labeling in language models, by addressing issues in content matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of language models in span labeling, which currently face inconsistent outcomes due to limited mechanisms for input referencing.

Method: The authors develop 'LogitMatch,' a constrained decoding method that aligns model outputs with valid input spans, and categorize existing strategies into tagging, indexing, and matching.

Result: LogitMatch outperforms existing matching-based methods by addressing span matching issues and surpasses others in specific scenarios while maintaining robust baseline performance.

Conclusion: LogitMatch offers a promising advancement in span labeling by solving known issues, providing better consistency and performance in targeted setups.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text analysis tasks, such as named entity recognition or error detection. Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.

*Xiaoyan Xing,Philipp Henzler,Junhwa Hur,Runze Li,Jonathan T. Barron,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Dor Verbin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for 3D relighting of large room-scale environments using video-to-video relighting diffusion models, bypassing complex inverse rendering challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D scene relighting methods struggle with complex real-world scenes due to the need for solving challenging inverse rendering problems.

Method: The method leverages generative video-to-video relighting diffusion models to seamlessly integrate relighting into 3D reconstructions, avoiding under-determined inverse rendering issues.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that this approach effectively renders novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

Conclusion: By using a diffusion-based approach, the method provides a flexible and high-quality relighting solution for 3D reconstructions of real-world room-scale scenes.

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

*Dohun Lee,Chun-Hao Paul Huang,Xuelin Chen,Jong Chul Ye,Duygu Ceylan,Hyeonho Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Memory-V2V, a framework for iterative video editing that improves cross-consistency and computational efficiency by incorporating explicit memory and token compression strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing models struggle to maintain consistency across sequential edits in iterative editing processes, which is essential for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed Memory-V2V framework utilizes an external cache for prior results and incorporates retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies. It also introduces a learnable token compressor to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: Memory-V2V significantly enhances cross-consistency in video editing, reduces computational redundancy with a 30% speedup, and improves performance in tasks like video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned editing.

Conclusion: Memory-V2V successfully addresses multi-turn video editing challenges, offering consistent outputs and computational efficiency without compromising overall performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'perspective tokens' to enhance multimodal language models (MLMs) in spatial reasoning and visual perspective tasks, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning and perspective-taking due to an egocentric bias, limiting their ability to perform allocentric reasoning.

Method: The authors propose 'perspective tokens,' embeddings that encode orientation using either body-keypoint cues or abstract mental rotation representations. These tokens are integrated into LLaVA-1.5-13B and evaluated across various benchmarks.

Result: Perspective tokens improved MLM performance in spatial perspective-taking tasks, particularly on benchmarks like Isle Bricks V2, COCO, and 3DSRBench. They also revealed latent orientation sensitivity in base models.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial perspective embeddings enhances allocentric reasoning in MLMs, providing a more human-like mechanism for spatial cognition and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper presents an energy-efficient framework using spiking neural networks (SNNs) for 3D brain tumor segmentation, showcasing reduced computational costs and robust uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable and energy-efficient approach for 3D brain tumor segmentation suitable for low-power medical applications.

Method: A multi-view ensemble of SNN models was employed along with Forward Propagation Through Time (FPTT) to ensure reduced computational cost and improved segmentation efficiency.

Result: Experiments on BraTS datasets showed competitive accuracy, robust uncertainty estimation, and a significant reduction in FLOPs by 87%.

Conclusion: The methodology demonstrates the potential of SNNs in providing reliable, low-power solutions for medical IoT and Point-of-Care systems.

Abstract: We propose a reliable and energy-efficient framework for 3D brain tumor segmentation using spiking neural networks (SNNs). A multi-view ensemble of sagittal, coronal, and axial SNN models provides voxel-wise uncertainty estimation and enhances segmentation robustness. To address the high computational cost in training SNN models for semantic image segmentation, we employ Forward Propagation Through Time (FPTT), which maintains temporal learning efficiency with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenges (BraTS 2017 and BraTS 2023) demonstrate competitive accuracy, well-calibrated uncertainty, and an 87% reduction in FLOPs, underscoring the potential of SNNs for reliable, low-power medical IoT and Point-of-Care systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate performance degradation in federated learning when dealing with domain shifts and heterogeneity in multi-institutional medical imaging data.

Method: The paper introduces FeTTL, a framework that jointly learns a global template and task model to harmonize data distributions among federated clients.

Result: FeTTL outperformed state-of-the-art federated learning baselines in optical disc segmentation and metastasis classification, demonstrating statistical significance (p-values < 0.002).

Conclusion: FeTTL is an effective and extensible approach to address distribution shifts in federated learning, enabling robust model deployment in multi-institutional medical environments.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper assesses how well foundation models can identify crucial sub-events in temporally-ordered multimodal contexts such as football. Results show limitations in the models' performance, revealing reliance on one modality and lack of cross-modal synthesis capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand foundation models' ability to process and rank key events in multimodal data, particularly in generating narrative or summarization for real-world cases like sports events.

Method: The authors create a new dataset using implicit human preferences from football highlight reels and evaluate state-of-the-art models on distinguishing important from non-important sub-events.

Result: The tested models perform close to chance and struggle to synthesize multimodal information effectively. Models showed reliance on single-dominant modalities.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for modular model architectures and improved training strategies to better handle multimodal heterogeneity and achieve effective cross-modal integration.

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

*Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a method for aligning multi-modal images of historical panel paintings using a non-rigid registration technique and keypoints based on craquelure features, achieving improved registration performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of manually aligning multi-modal image data of historical paintings, such as differing resolutions, distortions, and modality-specific content, while improving efficiency and precision.

Method: The method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) for craquelure-based keypoint detection and description, a graph neural network for descriptor matching, and a multi-level keypoint refinement approach for coarse-to-fine registration.

Result: The proposed method, tested on a comprehensive dataset with five multi-modal domains and various image resolutions, showed superior registration performance compared to competing methods. Ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of its modules.

Conclusion: The proposed coarse-to-fine registration approach successfully addresses challenges in multi-modal image alignment of historical paintings, providing more precise and efficient registration performance.

Abstract: Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yiheng Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VTFusion, a framework designed for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) by integrating adaptive domain-specific vision-text fusion techniques for industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FSAD approaches face challenges due to reliance on pre-trained features unsuitable for industrial data and ineffective cross-modal fusion strategies.

Method: VTFusion incorporates adaptive feature extractors for both modalities and a multimodal prediction fusion module that enhances anomaly detection using synthetic anomalies and cross-modal exchange mechanisms.

Result: VTFusion achieves outstanding FSAD performance on industrial datasets, including AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% on MVTec AD and VisA datasets, and an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world automotive dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses FSAD challenges in industrial scenarios and demonstrates practical applicability with significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.

*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called EBD-VBR for Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), addressing shortcomings in existing methods by combining entropy-based point discovery and vision-based reasoning to enhance segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve RES, which enables pixel-level target understanding via linguistic expressions, addressing limitations of current methods such as dependency on unreliable point prompts and textual coordinate reasoning.

Method: EBD is used to identify high-information points through spatial uncertainty modeling, and VBR ensures robust point validation by combining visual-semantic alignment, forming a coarse-to-fine segmentation workflow.

Result: EBD-VBR sets new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg, confirming its efficacy in accurate segmentation with minimal inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed EBD-VBR effectively addresses RES limitations by improving point discovery and reasoning processes, delivering semantically robust and accurate segmentation masks for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSRNet employs heterogeneous blocks and a cosine annealing mechanism for more effective image super-resolution results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of structural information used in image super-resolution through a novel network architecture and training strategy.

Method: Designed odd and even heterogeneous blocks to manage structural information. Introduced a cosine annealing mechanism with warm restarts to optimize training and adjust learning rates.

Result: CSRNet demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CSRNet effectively recovers high-quality images by leveraging complementary structural information and optimized training strategies.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can use hierarchical information to progressively extract structural information to recover high-quality images. However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging task of detecting small, low-contrast targets in complex backgrounds for applications like surveillance and remote sensing. Current methods face issues with imbalanced local-global features and feature redundancy.

Method: The proposed method, DCCS-Det, includes a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block for combining local and directional global features, and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module to improve feature quality via cross-scale and random pooling strategies.

Result: DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency in detecting small infrared targets across several datasets. Ablation studies confirm substantial contributions from the DSE and LaSEA modules.

Conclusion: DCCS-Det effectively tackles challenges in infrared small object detection, particularly under complex conditions, showcasing robust target representation and detection capabilities.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with extreme facial poses and require additional resources, while diffusion methods are not suitable for real-time processing.

Method: AlphaFace incorporates an open-source vision-language model, CLIP embeddings, and novel semantic contrastive losses to enhance identity representation and attribute preservation.

Result: Experiments on FF++, MPIE, and LPFF datasets show AlphaFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: AlphaFace achieves a balance between high-quality results and real-time performance, improving pose robustness without additional computational burdens.

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDAFNet, an advanced infrared small target detection network that resolves target edge degradation and frequency interference issues using multi-scale and frequency adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods suffer from target edge degradation with increasing network layers and convolution inefficiency in distinguishing frequency components, causing false detections and low performance.

Method: The authors propose MDAFNet which incorporates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module for edge enhancement and the Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module for improved frequency-based target detection.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets validate the superior detection accuracy and performance of the proposed MDAFNet model.

Conclusion: MDAFNet shows enhanced infrared small target detection by mitigating target edge degradation and frequency interference issues effectively, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.

TL;DR: The paper presents Emotion-LLaMAv2, an advanced multimodal large language model for emotional reasoning, along with the MMEVerse benchmark for standardized evaluation in emotion recognition and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current multimodal emotional reasoning systems, such as reliance on explicit face detectors, lack of high-quality annotations, and absence of standardized benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose three advancements: an end-to-end multiview encoder for richer emotional cues, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module for enhanced feature interactions, and a curriculum learning scheme for unifying emotion recognition and reasoning.

Result: Emotion-LLaMAv2 is trained on the new MMEVerse dataset, which consolidates twelve public datasets and provides 130k training and 36k testing clips. This enables high-quality reproducible evaluation across 18 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark set new standards for multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning, addressing key limitations of existing systems and creating a robust, reproducible framework.

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation in current segmentation models that treat pathology segmentation as a static task and fail to incorporate diverse pathology structures and expert feedback.

Method: VISTA-PATH combines visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and user-provided spatial prompts to enable detailed multi-class segmentation for pathology images. It uses a curated dataset of 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets, enhancing model performance and compatibility with clinical tasks.

Result: The model outperforms existing segmentation models in external benchmarks, supports human-in-the-loop refinement, and provides high-fidelity segmentation that aids clinical analysis such as the Tumor Interaction Score (TIS).

Conclusion: VISTA-PATH shifts pathology segmentation from static prediction to a dynamic, interactive, and clinically applicable methodology, improving tissue analysis and patient outcome predictions.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of existing datasets in physical reasoning, such as high costs in annotating real-world videos and lack of realism in synthetic simulations, by leveraging gameplay glitches as a scalable and diverse data source.

Method: The paper introduces PhysGame, a dataset with 140,057 glitch-centric QA pairs using a prompting strategy based on gameplay metadata, and GameBench, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning. The approach uses anomalies in games as a learning pathway.

Result: By tuning models with PhysGame, the performance on real-world reasoning (Game2Real) improved by 2.5%, and general reasoning (Game2General) increased by 1.9%. Models also achieved a 3.7% improvement on GameBench, enhancing detection of physical implausibilities.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that anomalies from gameplay videos can serve as an effective and scalable tool for advancing physical reasoning in multimodal AI, showing potential for broader real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VGGT models depend on labeled training data, limiting their application to unlabeled and unseen scenes, creating the need for self-supervised learning approaches.

Method: The proposed framework extends conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints using sampled source frames geometrically projected onto multiple target frames.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of spatiotemporal inconsistency in video generation models, particularly in highly dynamic real-world environments, and improve synthesis capabilities for arbitrary camera viewpoints.

Method: Develop a diffusion-based framework, AnyView, utilizing multi-source datasets including monocular, multi-view static, and multi-view dynamic to generalize spatiotemporal implicit representations.

Result: AnyView achieves competitive and consistent performance in video generation benchmarks and excels in extreme dynamic view synthesis scenarios, maintaining high realism and consistency compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: AnyView demonstrates robust and scalable video generation capabilities from arbitrary viewpoints, outperforming typical baselines in maintaining spatiotemporal consistency under challenging dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents EKDC-Net, a network for tree species classification that incorporates expert knowledge and improves accuracy using minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity in tree species classification, which limit existing methods in distinguishing few-shot or confusing categories.

Method: The proposed EKDC-Net uses a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM) to extract expert knowledge and an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM) to calibrate predictions dynamically.

Result: The approach improves classification accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% with minimal additional parameters (0.08M) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The work introduces a scalable and efficient classification framework, EKDC-Net, and a new dataset CU-Tree102, contributing significantly to biodiversity monitoring and forest inventory.

Abstract: Accurate fine-grained tree species classification is critical for forest inventory and biodiversity monitoring. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external "Domain Expert" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/TreeCLS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SALAD, a method to accelerate Diffusion Transformers for video generation with sparse and linear attention, achieving high sparsity and speedup without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational latency of full attention in video generation due to long input sequences and quadratic complexity, while maintaining performance.

Method: SALAD incorporates a lightweight linear attention branch parallel to sparse attention, balanced via an input-dependent gating mechanism. It uses an efficient finetuning process requiring minimal data and steps.

Result: SALAD achieves 90% sparsity, a 1.72x inference speedup, and generation quality on par with the full attention baseline.

Conclusion: SALAD provides an effective balance between computational efficiency and performance in video generation, with a highly efficient finetuning process.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TangramPuzzle, a benchmark for evaluating compositional spatial reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating the compositional spatial reasoning of MLLMs with precise geometric criteria, which are often lacking in current frameworks.

Method: Researchers designed TangramPuzzle, which includes the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE) for exact machine-verifiable coordinate specifications. They proposed two tasks: Outline Prediction and End-to-End Code Generation.

Result: Evaluation experiments revealed that MLLMs prioritize matching shapes but often fail to adhere to geometric constraints, leading to distortions in the outputs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the gap in MLLMs' compositional spatial reasoning abilities and the value of the TangramPuzzle benchmark in assessing and improving this aspect.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchoredDream generates realistic 360° indoor scenes from a single image using a zero-shot pipeline with geometry and appearance boosting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to generate realistic 360° indoor scenes from single images, despite challenges of appearance consistency and geometric plausibility in existing methods.

Method: A zero-shot pipeline using an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism and modules like warp-and-inpaint, Grouting Block, etc., to achieve high-fidelity results.

Result: AnchoredDream significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual consistency and geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed anchored approach sets a high standard for realistic single-view 360° scene generation while addressing current limitations effectively.

Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial understanding overlook adaptability to changing environments and real-world deployment feasibility.

Method: Developed the OnlineSI framework with finite spatial memory to ensure scalable computation and integration of 3D point cloud information with semantics.

Result: Introduced Fuzzy $F_1$-Score for evaluation and demonstrated success of OnlineSI on datasets improving spatial understanding in videos.

Conclusion: OnlineSI offers a solution for real-world embodied systems by enabling enhanced spatial understanding and reasoning through continuous learning.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance hierarchical open-set classification by incorporating the semi-supervised learning scenario, enabling better utilization of large mixed datasets containing known and unknown classes.

Method: A teacher-student framework is developed, introducing subtree pseudo-labels for supervision and age-gating to prevent overconfidence in pseudo-labeling, applied to a hierarchical open-set classification task.

Result: The proposed method outperforms self-supervised pretraining and supervised adaptation. It matches fully supervised performance using minimal labeled samples (20 per class) in the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach proves effective for semi-supervised hierarchical open-set classification, achieving notable performance gains and providing a valid alternative to fully supervised models with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework called HA2F for improving remote sensing change detection (RSCD) using dual modules to address feature alignment and noise sensitivity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve existing RSCD methods that face challenges such as cross-temporal feature matching deviations and sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise.

Method: The proposed HA2F framework includes two modules: DHFCM for adaptive feature calibration via dynamic fusion and NAFRM for noise-adaptive feature refinement using spatial masks.

Result: Experiments show HA2F achieves superior results compared to existing methods on several datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HA2F is effective and enhances RSCD performance, with ablation studies confirming the significance of its dual modules—DHFCM and NAFRM.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for CoVR show limited improvements by fusing multimodal inputs in a single stage, necessitating a more effective approach to integrate visual and textual queries.

Method: The authors propose a framework featuring a cross-attention module (X-Aligner) for progressive multimodal fusion and use captions as additional inputs. The two-stage training process aims to keep the pretrained VLM representations intact.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Recall@1 of 63.93% on the Webvid-CoVR-Test dataset and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles limitations of current CoVR methods by leveraging advanced multimodal fusion and pretrained models, setting a strong performance benchmark.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR obtaining a Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in medical AI, including limited annotations, computational constraints, and poor generalization in models.

Method: The framework uses MobileNetV2 as the backbone, pre-trained with a SimCLR self-supervised approach, coupled with a parameterized quantum circuit for feature enhancement, forming a hybrid classical-quantum model.

Result: The method improved Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score compared to classical approaches, validated with fewer parameters and reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: This hybrid classical-quantum solution enables resource-efficient, high-performing medical AI, showing promise for medical image analysis in constrained environments.

Abstract: Intelligent medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision support but is often limited by scarce annotations, constrained computational resources, and suboptimal model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability. Overall, this work provides a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical artificial intelligence under resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: Challenges exist in accurately detecting small objects from UAV imagery due to imbalanced scales and blurred edges.

Method: BPIM integrates position and boundary information, as well as cross-scale fusion strategies using multiple modules such as PIG, BIG, CSF, TFF, and AWF.

Result: BPIM enhances contextual discrimination and small object detection, outperforming baseline Yolov5-P2 across VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets.

Conclusion: The BPIM framework provides promising performance in small object detection compared to state-of-the-art methods at comparable computational load.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models. This research highlights the potential of SCHIGAND to supplement and, in some cases, replace real data for facial biometric applications, paving the way for privacy-compliant and scalable solutions in synthetic dataset generation.

Motivation: Maintaining pixel-level edge structures during image editing using LDMs is challenging, affecting tasks like photorealistic style transfer and tone adjustment.

Method: The proposed Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) integrates into the LDM generative process using local linear models, complemented by post-processing, a masking strategy, and a color preservation loss.

Result: SPL significantly improves structural fidelity in latent-diffusion-based image editing, as confirmed through experiments.

Conclusion: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in maintaining structural features during image editing with latent diffusion models, with planned code release for community use.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing.

TL;DR: ReWeaver is a framework for topology-accurate 3D garment reconstruction using sparse multi-view RGB images, improving simulations and robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle limitations in existing unstructured garment reconstruction methods, such as inaccuracies in garment topology, making outputs unsuitable for high-fidelity simulations.

Method: ReWeaver reconstructs 3D garments by predicting seams and panels along with their connectivity in both 2D UV and 3D spaces. A large-scale dataset (GCD-TS) is introduced for training.

Result: ReWeaver demonstrates superior performance in terms of topology accuracy, geometric alignment, and seam-panel consistency compared to existing models.

Conclusion: ReWeaver enables accurate 3D garment reconstruction suitable for simulations and applications like digital avatars, virtual try-on, and robotic manipulation.

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

*Hongda Liu,Yunfan Liu,Min Ren,Lin Sui,Yunlong Wang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACLNet, a model that improves feature discrimination for skeleton-based human activity understanding by exploiting structural inter-class relationships and addressing challenges with anomalous positive samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for skeleton-based human activity understanding fail to examine inter-class similarities and overlook the challenges posed by anomalous samples, causing limitations in feature discrimination.

Method: The model utilizes an affinity metric to form activity superclasses, a dynamic temperature schedule for adjusting penalties, and a margin-based strategy for handling hard positive and negative samples.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate ACLNet's performance improvement across multiple benchmarks for skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

Conclusion: ACLNet effectively refines contrastive learning with sophisticated strategies, enhancing skeleton-based human activity recognition tasks.

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

### [106] [CER-HV: A CER-Based Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Cleaning Datasets Applied to Arabic-Script HTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16713)
*Sana Al-azzawi,Elisa Barney,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Arabic-script handwritten text recognition (HTR), introducing CER-HV to enhance data quality by identifying and removing label errors, alongside achieving state-of-the-art recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome the gap between Arabic-script HTR and Latin-script HTR by addressing data quality issues and proposing an effective framework for detection and cleaning of label errors.

Method: The CER-HV framework uses a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) for noise detection with early stopping to avoid overfitting, coupled with human verification for high-ranking samples.

Result: CER-HV identifies errors in datasets with up to 90% precision and improves recognition performance by reducing Character Error Rates (CER) on noisier datasets by up to 1.8%. The CRNN achieved state-of-the-art CER results across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Improved data quality through CER-HV demonstrably enhances HTR performance for Arabic-script languages, offering a general framework applicable to other text recognition datasets.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

*Yann Le Gall,Nicolas Burlet,Mathieu Simon,Fabien Novella,Samantha Dugelay,Jean-Philippe Malkasse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to retrieve and utilize shadow information in Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) data for improved target analysis and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSAS provides high-resolution 360° views of the seabed but loses shadow details critical for target recognition and analysis, creating the need to recover shadow information.

Method: The paper uses sub-aperture filtering for shadow retrieval, Fixed Focus Shadow Enhancement (FFSE) for sharpening shadows, and proposes an interactive visualization interface for shadow analysis. Additionally, a space-carving method is applied for 3D reconstruction using shadow data.

Result: The recovery and utilization of shadow information enhances target analysis and enables accurate 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: Shadows in CSAS data serve as valuable cues for improving target recognition and 3D reconstruction, showcasing the capability to enhance operational outcomes in areas like mine warfare.

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

*Renjie Ding,Yaonan Wang,Min Liu,Jialin Zhu,Jiazheng Wang,Jiahao Zhao,Wenting Shen,Feixiang He,Xiang Che*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits and proposes enhancements for the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by identifying issues with update coupling and gradient coupling, re-thinking the process, and introducing a redesigned optimization technique called AdamW-GS for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address overlooked issues in the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), specifically update step coupling and gradient coupling, to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, and Decoupled Attribute Regularization to decouple the optimization process. It then proposes a re-designed optimization approach, AdamW-GS, by recombining the beneficial aspects discovered through empirical analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AdamW-GS achieves better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness in 3DGS.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of 3DGS optimization and introduces AdamW-GS, which improves both efficiency and effectiveness, by addressing critical overlooked issues.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework using open-source data and YOLOv11 to localize highway cracks, validating its utility with a Swiss RHCD index for highway maintenance guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address the rising challenge of maintaining highways under stress from climate-induced temperature fluctuations, which increase costs. Efficient maintenance strategies leveraging publicly available data are deemed essential.

Method: The framework integrates airborne imagery with OpenStreetMap data and refines YOLOv11 to localize highway cracks. The Swiss RHCD index was developed and correlated with various parameters to demonstrate its relevance for maintenance.

Result: The framework's crack classification achieved an F1-score of 0.84 (cracks) and 0.97 (no cracks). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlation with LT-LST-A and TV, showing its unique contribution. High RHCD values were noted near urban centers and intersections.

Conclusion: Open-source data sharing can facilitate highway infrastructure maintenance innovations, particularly by enabling accurate, targeted, and efficient strategies, as demonstrated by the framework's validation with the Swiss RHCD index.

Abstract: Highway networks are crucial for economic prosperity. Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations are exacerbating stress on road pavements, resulting in elevated maintenance costs. This underscores the need for targeted and efficient maintenance strategies. This study investigates the potential of open-source data to guide highway infrastructure maintenance. The proposed framework integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization. To demonstrate the framework's real-world applicability, a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index was calculated to inform nationwide highway maintenance. The crack classification model achieved an F1-score of $0.84$ for the positive class (crack) and $0.97$ for the negative class (no crack). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlations with Long-term Land Surface Temperature Amplitudes (LT-LST-A) (Pearson's $r\ = -0.05$) and Traffic Volume (TV) (Pearson's $r\ = 0.17$), underlining the added value of this novel index for guiding maintenance over other data. Significantly high RHCD values were observed near urban centers and intersections, providing contextual validation for the predictions. These findings highlight the value of open-source data sharing to drive innovation, ultimately enabling more efficient solutions in the public sector.

*Cuong Le,Pavló Melnyk,Bastian Wandt,Mårten Wadenbäck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method, improves accuracy and speed using flow matching techniques and graph convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of depth ambiguity and overconfident incorrect estimations in 3D human pose recovery using a monocular camera.

Method: FMPose employs a flow matching generative approach with continuous normalizing flows for optimal transport and models 2D lifting via graph convolutional networks.

Result: FMPose demonstrates faster and more accurate 3D pose estimations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: The method showcases significant advancements in 3D human pose estimation accuracy and efficiency by leveraging probabilistic approaches and optimal transport techniques.

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

### [112] [AutoRegressive Generation with B-rep Holistic Token Sequence Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16771)
*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrepARG, a sequence-based autoregressive architecture for B-rep generation using a novel token sequence representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing B-rep generation approaches rely on graph-based representations that separate geometric and topological features, preventing the use of sequence-based frameworks like transformers.

Method: The BrepARG encodes B-reps into three types of tokens: geometry, position, and topology, constructs a hierarchical token sequence, and employs a transformer-based autoregressive model for next-token prediction.

Result: Experimental results show BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing the feasibility of holistic token sequence representation for B-reps.

Conclusion: BrepARG demonstrates the effectiveness of representing and generating B-reps with holistic token sequences, paving the way for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

*Shuai Huang,Xuhan Lin,Yuwu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CASP, a mechanism to improve few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) by steering CLS token attention and augmenting feature generalization, achieving superior performance with reduced parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL), which require adapting to novel classes with limited data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and to utilize pretrained knowledge effectively for future class generalization.

Method: The paper proposes CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP), introducing bias parameters into self-attention weights of the CLS token to filter task-irrelevant information. Additionally, an attention perturbation strategy and Manifold Token Mixup are employed to enhance generalization by synthesizing potential class features.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CASP exceeds state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization for FSCIL across datasets like CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R, while significantly reducing parameter overhead and removing the need for fine-tuning during incremental phases.

Conclusion: CASP is a robust approach to FSCIL that effectively utilizes pretrained knowledge, improves generalization, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and achieves superior results with minimal parameter increase and no incremental fine-tuning.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method proposed for precise spinal ligament landmark detection with higher accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate ligament attachment representation in spine modeling for biomechanical simulations.

Method: Shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae combined with domain-specific rules for attachment point detection.

Result: Validates on two datasets with MAE of 0.7 mm and RMSE of 1.1 mm, showing strong generalization and accuracy.

Conclusion: Proposed approach improves reliability and accuracy for spinal region modeling applications.

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

*Xuewei Li,Xinghan Bao,Zhimin Chen,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces REL-SF4PASS, a novel method for panoramic semantic segmentation using cylindrical coordinates for depth representation and a dynamic multi-modal fusion strategy to enhance scene perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve panoramic semantic segmentation performance by overcoming limitations in depth representation and fusion strategies, and making better use of panoramic image geometry.

Method: The paper proposes the REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinates and the SMMF dynamic fusion strategy to adapt to different regions within panoramic images.

Result: Experimental results show an improvement of 2.35% average mIoU on the Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets and a reduction in performance variance by 70% under 3D disturbances.

Conclusion: REL-SF4PASS significantly enhances performance and robustness in panoramic semantic segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness through improved accuracy and stability.

Abstract: As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) aims to give complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance.

*Chen-Ying Chien,Po-Chih Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study presents a CNN-LSTM framework using visual data and eye-tracking to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors, achieving higher accuracy on subjective and objective aesthetic dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand perceptions of interior spaces and develop predictive models for evaluating aesthetic experiences, which are highly subjective and complex.

Method: The study uses a dual-branch CNN-LSTM model that integrates video-based visual features and eye-tracking signals. Evaluation is based on a dataset of 224 interior design videos, gaze data, and 15 aesthetic dimensions rated by participants.

Result: The model achieves 72.2% accuracy on objective visual dimensions and 66.8% on subjective dimensions, outperforming existing models. Eye-tracking enhances evaluations, even though the model works well with only visual input.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking data improves model predictions and subjective evaluations, making it a valuable tool for aesthetic assessment in interior design, even when not always available during deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

*Chenxi Ruan,Yu Xiao,Yihan Hou,Guosheng Hu,Wei Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ColorConceptBench to evaluate color-concept associations in text-to-image models, revealing their shortcomings in addressing implicit color semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how text-to-image (T2I) models handle implicit or abstract color concepts, which is underexplored compared to explicit color associations.

Method: Developed ColorConceptBench, a benchmark with 6,369 human annotations over 1,281 color concepts, and systematically tested seven T2I models for their capability to associate implicit color concepts with probable distributions.

Result: Seven T2I models were found to lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, with limitations persisting despite using common improvement techniques like scaling and guidance.

Conclusion: Achieving human-like recognition of implicit color semantics in T2I models requires a paradigm shift in learning representations, beyond merely expanding model sizes.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

*Fangzheng Wu,Brian Summa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight, validation-free method to select checkpoints and monitor performance during training using a gradient-based criterion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for validation labels during model training, providing a more efficient and universal process for checkpoint selection and early stopping.

Method: They use the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch as a signal to evaluate model progress over forward-backward passes. They also suggest normalization techniques based on the model family.

Result: The proposed approach closely matches oracle-level checkpoint selection performance, works across various neural network architectures, and is efficient with less than 0.1% of epoch cost.

Conclusion: Their method offers an effective and practical approach to validation-free checkpointing and early stopping, making training pipelines more efficient and label-independent.

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced VLMs, especially Qwen2.5, into surgical processes shows significant promise for enhancing surgical tool detection and advancing AI in surgery.

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in long-form video generation, proposing a lightweight method to mitigate performance decay and sink-collapse issues. It enables real-time, infinite-length video generation with consistent quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video generation suffers from coherence loss and error accumulation, especially with sink-collapse failure due to structural conflicts in generative models.

Method: The authors propose a training-free approach called multi-head RoPE jitter to break inter-head attention homogenization and suppress sink-collapse in video generation models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method alleviates sink-collapse while maintaining quality, enabling streaming video generation up to 12 hours with negligible quality decay.

Conclusion: The method effectively suppresses long-horizon coherence issues, supports real-time infinite-length video generation, and represents a significant advancement in streaming video generative technology.

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

*Jingran Zhang,Ning Li,Yuanhao Ban,Andrew Bai,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reward-guided approach for autoregressive video generation, achieving results comparable or superior to current methods without relying on strong teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of existing autoregressive video generation models, which rely heavily on teacher architectures, often resulting in lower performance and constrained output quality.

Method: The authors propose an approach guided by reward signals, allowing for more efficient and scalable autoregressive video generation without the constraints imposed by teacher models. This method improves training simplicity, visual fidelity, and temporal consistency.

Result: The proposed model successfully matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art autoregressive methods on benchmarks such as VBench, achieving a score of 84.92 without requiring complex distillation processes.

Conclusion: The reward-guided method provides an elegant solution for enhancing autoregressive video generation, combining efficiency, simplicity, and strong output quality, making it a promising alternative to traditional teacher-dependent methods.

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

*Ba-Thinh Lam,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Hoang-Thien Nguyen,Quang-Khai Bui-Tran,Nguyen Lan Vi Vu,Phat K. Huynh,Ulas Bagci,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a domain-invariant framework for mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation, tackling challenges with limited annotations and severe domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by scarce annotations and domain discrepancies in medical image segmentation, where images are acquired from various centers or scanners.

Method: The framework incorporates a Copy-Paste Mechanism for data augmentation and a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy block to align unlabeled features with labeled anchors for domain-invariant representations, integrated into a teacher-student architecture.

Result: The method achieves robust segmentation performance even with limited labeled data and unknown domain discrepancies, outperforming existing semi-supervised and domain adaptation approaches in benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach presents a promising solution for overcoming mixed-domain challenges in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, enhancing robustness and precision.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisGym, a suite of environments to evaluate and train Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multi-step visual decision-making tasks, revealing their limitations and providing potential improvement pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation settings for VLMs in multi-step visual interactions and decision-making tasks over long horizons.

Method: The authors developed VisGym, which consists of 17 diverse environments. It allows for flexible difficulty controls, input formats, and planning horizons, alongside multi-step solvers for supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments showed that most VLMs struggle with interactive tasks, exhibiting low success rates, with degraded performance on unbounded histories and difficulties in processing visual-contextual tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the current limitations of VLMs in interactive multi-step contexts and suggests improvements such as incorporating goal observations, textual feedback, and fine-tuning through exploratory demonstrations.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

*David Serrano-Lozano,Anand Bhattad,Luis Herranz,Jean-François Lalonde,Javier Vazquez-Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncLight is a method for consistent relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene, addressing challenges like lighting consistency in multi-camera setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining lighting consistency for multi-view applications like broadcasts or stereoscopic cinema.

Method: SyncLight uses a multi-view diffusion transformer with a latent bridge matching formulation, trained on a hybrid dataset of synthetic and real-world captures.

Result: SyncLight achieves high-fidelity, parametric relighting across multi-view scenes, generalizing to arbitrary viewpoints without needing camera pose information.

Conclusion: SyncLight simplifies and enhances practical workflows for consistent relighting in multi-view capture systems.

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

### [125] [Space Filling Curves is All You Need: Communication-Avoiding Matrix Multiplication Made Simple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16294)
*Evangelos Georganas,Alexander Heinecke,Pradeep Dubey*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using generalized Space Filling Curves (SFC) for more efficient and platform-independent matrix multiplication, outperforming existing vendor libraries on CPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize matrix multiplication, a critical kernel in Deep Learning and HPC, especially on modern CPUs with matrix accelerators, minimizing data movement across memory hierarchies to mitigate performance bottlenecks.

Method: The method leverages partitioning of matrix multiplication computation using generalized Hilbert Curves for improved data locality and extends this with Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms to minimize data movement, enabling compact and efficient implementations.

Result: The proposed SFC-based and CA-algorithm implementations achieve state-of-the-art results, improving performance by up to 2x compared to vendor libraries on various CPU platforms and matrix shapes.

Conclusion: The study presents a robust, shape-independent, and platform-oblivious approach to matrix multiplication achieving substantial performance enhancements with minimal implementation complexity.

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is the cornerstone of Deep Learning and HPC workloads; accordingly, academia and industry have heavily optimized this kernel. Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance "glass jaws". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes.

### [126] [Consensus In Asynchrony](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16460)
*Ivan Klianev*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fault-tolerant consensus algorithm using event-based synchronization in asynchronous settings. It reconciles with the FLP impossibility theorem by identifying new insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address deterministic fault-tolerant consensus in asynchronous systems while revisiting the limitations established by the FLP impossibility theorem.

Method: An algorithm is developed that achieves vector agreement under asynchronous conditions with safety, liveness, and fault tolerance. Additionally, theoretical analysis is provided regarding the assumptions of FLP impossibility.

Result: The algorithm achieves valid vector agreement despite asynchrony, tolerates one crash, and experimental results challenge the assumptions of the FLP impossibility theorem.

Conclusion: Events-based synchronization can overcome challenges posed by FLP impossibility under specific assumptions, which suggests potential for effective fault-tolerant consensus algorithms.

Abstract: We demonstrate sufficiency of events-based synchronisation for solving deterministic fault-tolerant consensus in asynchrony. Main result is an algorithm that terminates with valid vector agreement, hence operates with safety, liveness, and tolerance to one crash. Reconciling with the FLP impossibility result, we identified: i) existence of two types of agreements: data-independent and data-dependent; and ii) dependence of FLP theorem correctness on three implicit assumptions. Consensus impossibility with data-dependent agreement is contingent on two of them. The theorem-stated impossibility with every agreement type hinges entirely on the third. We provide experimental results showing that the third assumption has no evidence in support.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel for Huawei's Ascend 910 NPU, achieving up to 1.74x speedup and addressing limitations of the device's architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient weight-only quantization (W4A16) on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit, overcoming challenges of limited mixed-precision support and a decoupled compute architecture.

Method: Designed a W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel leveraging vector cores for INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to reduce memory latency.

Result: The method achieves up to 1.74x speedup for certain scenarios, but due to memory transfer limitations, the maximum speedup over FP16xFP16 multiplication is constrained to 1.48x.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for deploying quantized LLMs efficiently on domain-specific accelerators, with insights into performance challenges.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale, weight-only quantization (W4A16: 4-bit weights, 16-bit activations) becomes critical for reducing memory footprint with minimal accuracy loss. However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch. In the long run, our method lays a solid foundation and provides insightful views for the efficient deployment of quantized large language models on various domain-specific accelerators.

TL;DR: GOXN is an energy experimentation engine for Kubernetes microservices that measures compute, network, and storage energy, highlighting underestimation risks when network and storage energy are excluded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of service-level energy measurements for microservice-based applications, which require quantifying energy consumption in compute, network, and storage components.

Method: Developed GOXN, leveraging metrics from Kepler and cAdvisor, and employed an additive energy model to analyze container data for deriving service-level energy consumption.

Result: Excluding network and storage energy can underestimate auxiliary-service energy by up to 63%. High tracing loads shift energy dominance towards network and storage components.

Conclusion: Service-level energy measurement must account for network and storage energy to avoid significant underestimations, particularly under high tracing loads in microservices.

Abstract: Recent advancements enable fine-grained energy measurements in cloud-native environments (e.g., at container or process level) beyond traditional coarse-grained scopes. However, service-level energy measurement for microservice-based applications remains underexplored. Such measurements must include compute, network, and storage energy to avoid underestimating consumption in distributed setups. We present GOXN (Green Observability eXperiment eNginE), an energy experimentation engine for Kubernetes-based microservices that quantifies compute, network, and storage energy at the service level. Using GOXN, we evaluated the OpenTelemetry Demo under varying configurations (monitoring, tracing, service mesh) and steady synthetic load, collecting metrics from Kepler and cAdvisor. Our additive energy model derives service-level energy from container-level data. Results show that excluding network and storage can underestimate auxiliary-service energy by up to 63%, and that high tracing loads shift energy dominance toward network and storage.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to accelerate the classical workload of Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD), focusing on iterative Hamiltonian diagonalization in selected configuration subspaces, which is computationally expensive.

Method: The method involves implementing SBD with GPU acceleration by restructuring configuration processing, excitation generation, and matrix-vector operations using GPU-friendly data layouts and Thrust-based data-parallel primitives.

Result: The GPU-accelerated SBD achieves up to approximately 40x speedup over CPU execution and significantly reduces the runtime of SQD iterations.

Conclusion: The proposed GPU-native approach demonstrates the utility of parallel primitives for building portable, high-performance workflows for quantum-classical computations.

Abstract: Selected Basis Diagonalization (SBD) plays a central role in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD), where iterative diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in selected configuration subspaces forms the dominant classical workload. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of SBD using the Thrust library. By restructuring key components -- including configuration processing, excitation generation, and matrix-vector operations -- around fine-grained data-parallel primitives and flattened GPU-friendly data layouts, the proposed approach efficiently exploits modern GPU architectures. In our experiments, the Thrust-based SBD achieves up to $\sim$40$\times$ speedup over CPU execution and substantially reduces the total runtime of SQD iterations. These results demonstrate that GPU-native parallel primitives provide a simple, portable, and high-performance foundation for accelerating SQD-based quantum-classical workflows.

*Avinash Maurya,M. Mustafa Rafique,Franck Cappello,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel checkpointing architecture named DataStates-LLM to enhance efficiency in managing state during the training of large-scale transformer-based language models, achieving significant performance gains compared to existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in checkpointing distributed state in extreme-scale LLM training caused by heterogeneity in data structures and bottlenecks in serialization and data transfer.

Method: DataStates-LLM utilizes State Providers to separate state abstraction from data movement and employs asynchronous snapshots to streamline checkpointing processes, reducing runtime overheads.

Result: Experiments on models up to 70B parameters with 256 A100 GPUs show that DataStates-LLM improves checkpointing throughput by up to 4x and reduces training time by up to 2.2x compared to current solutions.

Conclusion: DataStates-LLM effectively overcomes checkpointing inefficiencies in large-scale LLM training, contributing to faster and more scalable training methods for state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Transformer-based models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), now scaling to trillions of parameters, has necessitated training across thousands of GPUs using complex hybrid parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism). Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the challenge of accurately learning DAG structures from purely observational data, which is critical in many scientific fields.

Method: The authors extend the score matching framework to discrete data and introduce a new leaf discriminant criterion using a discrete score function to initially identify DAG topological ordering before edge pruning for graph recovery.

Result: The method shows strong performance in both simulated and real-world experiments, accurately inferring causal orders and enhancing the efficacy of existing causal discovery algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust approach for learning DAG structures from discrete data, significantly improving causal order inference and helping existing methods perform better.

Abstract: Learning DAG structures from purely observational data remains a long-standing challenge across scientific domains. An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve model transparency and trust in clinical practice, addressing the gap between high-performing but opaque AI models and the need for interpretability in survival modelling applications.

Method: The authors introduced CRISPNAM-FG, which relies on Neural Additive Models with Fine-Gray formulations to ensure interpretability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy.

Result: The model demonstrates high predictive power and transparency, validated on benchmark datasets and real-world data from Ontario hospitals from 2016-2023.

Conclusion: CRISPNAM-FG provides interpretable and auditable predictions while achieving competitive performance, which could enhance AI adoption in clinical settings.

Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high levels of depression and anxiety among college students by leveraging wearable technology for mental health diagnosis.

Method: Machine learning models were applied to the StudentMEH Fitbit dataset, analyzing heart rate, sleep, and other physiological data to predict mental health issues.

Result: The study demonstrated high F1 scores for screening anxiety (0.79), stress (0.77), and depression (0.78) using heart rate and sleep modalities.

Conclusion: Wearable devices can play a critical role in continuous mental health monitoring, provided appropriate data aggregation levels and modalities are identified.

Abstract: College students experience many stressors, resulting in high levels of anxiety and depression. Wearable technology provides unobtrusive sensor data that can be used for the early detection of mental illness. However, current research is limited concerning the variety of psychological instruments administered, physiological modalities, and time series parameters. In this research, we collect the Student Mental and Environmental Health (StudentMEH) Fitbit dataset from students at our institution during the pandemic. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of predictive machine learning models to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress using different Fitbit modalities. Our findings indicate potential in physiological modalities such as heart rate and sleep to screen for mental illness with the F1 scores as high as 0.79 for anxiety, the former modality reaching 0.77 for stress screening, and the latter modality achieving 0.78 for depression. This research highlights the potential of wearable devices to support continuous mental health monitoring, the importance of identifying best data aggregation levels and appropriate modalities for screening for different mental ailments.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the training process of GPs by reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy.

Method: A new objective, Projected Likelihood, is introduced based on lower-dimensional projections of the data. It includes the calculation of information loss and its reduction via random projections on a unit sphere.

Result: PL demonstrates superiority in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional GP training and the variational approaches across various optimizers, kernels, and datasets.

Conclusion: The PL approach provides a practical alternative for training GPs, offering better performance and reduced computational demands for moderately large datasets.

Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.

*Shuhang Tan,Jayson Sia,Paul Bogdan,Radoslav Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to neural network data flow analysis using graph theory, particularly through the Ollivier-Ricci curvature, to identify critical and non-critical NN connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better analyze neural network connections and their impact on performance using graph theory, offering a potential tool for tasks like robustness assessment or model repair.

Method: The authors applied Ollivier-Ricci curvature to build neural curvature (NC) based on NN activation patterns, and ranked NN connections by their importance. They validated this ranking through pruning experiments.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that negative-ORC edges are critical to performance, and their removal leads to substantial degradation, while positive-ORC edges are less impactful. The method outperformed state-of-the-art pruning techniques in identifying non-critical edges.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-theoretic approach to NN data flow analysis provides a powerful framework for identifying important connections, with promising implications for network pruning and optimization.

Abstract: This paper provides a fresh view of the neural network (NN) data flow problem, i.e., identifying the NN connections that are most important for the performance of the full model, through the lens of graph theory. Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.

*Andrew Thompson,Miles McCrory*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides exact analytical expressions for propagation of uncertainty in single-hidden-layer ReLU-based MLPs, given multivariate Gaussian inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analytical results on uncertainty propagation in neural networks rely on approximations or series expansions, which may lack exactness. This paper aims to derive precise expressions for such uncertainty.

Method: The authors analytically derive the mean and variance of MLP outputs by focusing on inputs that are multivariate Gaussian, avoiding approximations.

Result: They obtain exact expressions for the output mean and variance of single-hidden-layer MLPs with ReLU activation under Gaussian input conditions.

Conclusion: The study enhances the understanding of uncertainty propagation through MLPs, offering exact formulas rather than relying on approximations or expansions.

Abstract: We give analytical results for propagation of uncertainty through trained multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with a single hidden layer and ReLU activation functions. More precisely, we give expressions for the mean and variance of the output when the input is multivariate Gaussian. In contrast to previous results, we obtain exact expressions without resort to a series expansion.

### [137] [A Regularized Actor-Critic Algorithm for Bi-Level Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16399)
*Sihan Zeng,Sujay Bhatt,Sumitra Ganesh,Alec Koppel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses bi-level optimization where the upper-level modifies rewards in an MDP and proposes a novel penalty-based, first-order actor-critic algorithm without relying on inefficient nested-loop procedures or strong regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for bi-level optimization in RL involve inefficiencies like second-order dependency, strong regularization, or nested-loop sample use.

Method: They developed a single-loop, penalty-based actor-critic algorithm with attenuated entropy regularization to estimate hyper-gradients without solving the RL problem exactly.

Result: Finite-time and finite-sample convergence to a stationary point is proved under a new analysis framework, supported by experiments on GridWorld and RLHF for tweet generation.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is efficient and avoids strong lower-level regularization, resolving issues in bi-level optimization framework with demonstrated effectiveness in practical RL tasks.

Abstract: We study a structured bi-level optimization problem where the upper-level objective is a smooth function and the lower-level problem is policy optimization in a Markov decision process (MDP). The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. We validate the performance of our method through experiments on a GridWorld goal position problem and on happy tweet generation through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

### [138] [Towards a Theoretical Understanding to the Generalization of RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16403)
*Zhaochun Li,Mingyang Yi,Yue Wang,Shisheng Cui,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes the generalization theory of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in high-dimensional settings for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite RLHF's empirical successes in aligning LLMs with human intent, its theoretical generalization properties in high-dimensional settings have been relatively unexplored.

Method: The paper utilizes algorithmic stability under a linear reward model, proven under a feature coverage condition, to develop the theoretical framework. It extends the results to gradient-based learning algorithms like Gradient Ascent and Stochastic Gradient Ascent.

Result: The analysis derived a generalization bound of order O(n^-1/2) for the empirical optima of policy models. This bound corroborates with the generalization observed in practice for LLMs after RLHF.

Conclusion: The findings provide new theoretical support for the generalization behavior of LLMs utilizing RLHF and enhance the understanding of its alignment properties.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have emerged as the dominant approaches for aligning Large Language Models with human intent. While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Thus, we argue that our results provide new theoretical evidence for the empirically observed generalization of LLMs after RLHF.

### [139] [Reasoning-Enhanced Rare-Event Prediction with Balanced Outcome Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16406)
*Vitaly Bulgakov,Alexander Turchin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPCORP is a two-stage framework designed for rare-event prediction, improving precision and reducing damage costs in imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in fields like healthcare and finance can have catastrophic consequences. The extreme class imbalance in these data sets reduces the efficacy of conventional prediction models.

Method: LPCORP combines a reasoning-enhanced prediction model with a logistic-regression corrector that mitigates bias without resampling the data.

Result: Significant performance gains in precision, improvement in class balance, and a cost reduction in rare-event management by over 50% were observed in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: LPCORP is effective in addressing low-prevalence biases and enhancing prediction-driven preventive measures in critical domains.

Abstract: Rare-event prediction is critical in domains such as healthcare, finance, reliability engineering, customer support, aviation safety, where positive outcomes are infrequent yet potentially catastrophic. Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.

### [140] [A Refinement of Vapnik--Chervonenkis' Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16411)
*A. Iosevich,A. Vagharshakyan,E. Wyman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits Vapnik–Chervonenkis' theorem, enhancing VC probability estimates by introducing a refined normal approximation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the classical Vapnik–Chervonenkis probability estimates by exploring moderate-deviation boundaries, to refine convergence analysis.

Method: They utilize a normal approximation with explicit Berry–Esseen error control instead of Hoeffding's inequality in the classical VC theorem.

Result: This approach introduces a sharper VC estimate with an additional factor $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}^{-1}$, enhancing accuracy in large $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper enhances the understanding of uniform convergence rates through refined probabilistic techniques, contributing to sharper probability bounds in large deviation setups.

Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.

### [141] [Multigrade Neural Network Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16884)
*Shijun Zhang,Zuowei Shen,Yuesheng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces multigrade deep learning (MGDL) as a framework to systematically reduce errors in deep neural networks by training in separate grades, achieving provable convergence of residuals to zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of training deep architectures, such as non-convex optimization landscapes, and to propose a structured training method inspired by the stability seen in shallow networks like one-layer ReLU models.

Method: The MGDL method trains networks grade-by-grade, freezing previously learned parameters and focusing the next grade solely on reducing the residual error in a hierarchical and stable manner with operator-theoretic foundations.

Result: The authors proved that MGDL achieves strict reductions in residuals across grades and ensures uniform convergence of errors to zero for a continuous target function. Numerical experiments support these findings.

Conclusion: MGDL provides a rigorous and interpretable approach to training deep networks with guarantees of error refinement and stability, offering a novel pathway for improving deep learning optimization and scalability.

Abstract: We study multigrade deep learning (MGDL) as a principled framework for structured error refinement in deep neural networks. While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks. Numerical experiments further illustrate the theoretical results.

### [143] [FedSGM: A Unified Framework for Constraint Aware, Bidirectionally Compressed, Multi-Step Federated Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16897)
*Antesh Upadhyay,Sang Bin Moon,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSGM is a unified framework tackling functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation in federated learning (FL), utilizing efficient gradient-based updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address primary challenges in FL, such as functional constraints, communication efficiency, and ensuring theoretical convergence guarantees in realistic settings.

Method: Leverages projection-free primal updates and applies bi-directional error feedback to manage compression noise and local updates, ensuring convergence despite partial client participation.

Result: Guarantees $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, introduces soft switching near constraints, and validates its effectiveness via experimentation in constrained tasks.

Conclusion: FedSGM provides a comprehensive framework addressing key federated learning challenges, unifying functional constraints, efficiency, and robust learning under practical limitations.

Abstract: We introduce FedSGM, a unified framework for federated constrained optimization that addresses four major challenges in federated learning (FL): functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning. Finally, we validate the theoretical guarantees of FedSGM via experimentation on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) tasks.

### [144] [Bayesian Experimental Design for Model Discrepancy Calibration: A Rivalry between Kullback--Leibler Divergence and Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16425)
*Huchen Yang,Xinghao Dong,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the trade-offs between Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Wasserstein distance as utility functions in Bayesian Experimental Design (BED).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the long-standing question of selecting appropriate utility functions in Bayesian Experimental Design (BED), as different criteria emphasize varying notions of information.

Method: The authors first use a toy example to analyze limitations of Wasserstein distance and then conduct a systematic comparison of KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics through a classical source inversion problem in BED.

Result: The study demonstrates that KL divergence achieves faster convergence in ideal conditions without model discrepancy, while Wasserstein distance provides more robust results in cases of significant model discrepancy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with guidelines for selecting the most suitable utility function, clarifying trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein distance in BED applications.

Abstract: Designing experiments that systematically gather data from complex physical systems is central to accelerating scientific discovery. While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.

*Navid Ardeshir,Samuel Deng,Daniel Hsu,Jingwen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows improved sample complexity for multi-group learning in the group-realizable setting, but highlights computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how group-realizable settings impact the sample complexity of multi-group learning, aiming to explore improvements over the agnostic setting, even for infinite families of groups with finite VC dimensions.

Method: Empirical risk minimization is used over group-realizable concepts to demonstrate improved sample complexity. However, the authors identify its computational intractability and propose improper learning as an alternative.

Result: The authors demonstrate that group-realizable settings lead to better sample complexity by employing empirical risk minimization, despite the concept class having infinite VC dimensions.

Conclusion: While group-realizable settings improve sample complexity, their computational intractability necessitates alternative approaches like improper learning.

Abstract: The sample complexity of multi-group learning is shown to improve in the group-realizable setting over the agnostic setting, even when the family of groups is infinite so long as it has finite VC dimension. The improved sample complexity is obtained by empirical risk minimization over the class of group-realizable concepts, which itself could have infinite VC dimension. Implementing this approach is also shown to be computationally intractable, and an alternative approach is suggested based on improper learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores modeling Vapor Pressure (VP) and Odor Threshold (OP), introduces rich molecular graph features, and presents a 'safe multitask' method for optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve odor-property modeling and evaluate models' out-of-distribution performance in VP and OP tasks.

Method: Uses Bemis-Murcko scaffold split, A20/E17 molecular graph features, GINE/PNA network backbones, and proposes 'safe multitask' methodology with techniques like delayed activation and gradient clipping.

Result: Achieves Val MSE of ~0.21 for VP with PNA regression and ~0.60-0.61 for OP single-task training. The 'safe multitask' approach yields improved VP generalization and avoids harming primary tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates robust methodology, reproducible experiments, and provides insights into model limitations and handling data noise through odor-property modeling.

Abstract: We investigate two important tasks in odor-related property modeling: Vapor Pressure (VP) and Odor Threshold (OP). To evaluate the model's out-of-distribution (OOD) capability, we adopt the Bemis-Murcko scaffold split. In terms of features, we introduce the rich A20/E17 molecular graph features (20-dimensional atom features + 17-dimensional bond features) and systematically compare GINE and PNA backbones. The results show: for VP, PNA with a simple regression head achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.21 (normalized space); for the OP single task under the same scaffold split, using A20/E17 with robust training (Huber/winsor) achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.60-0.61. For multitask training, we propose a **"safe multitask"** approach: VP as the primary task and OP as the auxiliary task, using delayed activation + gradient clipping + small weight, which avoids harming the primary task and simultaneously yields the best VP generalization performance. This paper provides complete reproducible experiments, ablation studies, and error-similarity analysis while discussing the impact of data noise and method limitations.

### [147] [A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979)
*Dayal Singh Kalra,Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet,Andrey Gromov,Ishita Mediratta,Kelvin Niu,Alexander H Miller,Michael Shvartsman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computationally efficient measure, critical sharpness ($λ_c$), for analyzing neural network loss curvature dynamics without prohibitive costs, thereby scaling analysis up to LLMs with 7B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct measurement of Hessian sharpness ($λ_{max}^H$), crucial to understanding LLM training dynamics, is computationally expensive, necessitating alternative methods.

Method: The authors utilize critical sharpness ($λ_c$), a less computationally intensive curvature measure requiring fewer than 10 forward passes, and develop relative critical sharpness ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$) for loss landscapes transitioning from pre-training to fine-tuning.

Result: The paper demonstrates scalable sharpness phenomena like progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability across pre-training and mid-training in OLMo-2 models with up to 7B parameters.

Conclusion: Critical sharpness provides a practical curvature analysis tool for diagnosing LLM training dynamics and optimizing data composition strategies across large-scale networks.

Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

*Kanishk Gandhi,Shivam Garg,Noah D. Goodman,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Endless Terminals, an autonomous pipeline generating diverse tasks for training reinforcement learning agents. Significant performance improvements were demonstrated across both synthetic and human-curated benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in self-improving agents caused by a lack of scalable, autonomous training environments, as existing benchmarks are designed for evaluation rather than training.

Method: The authors developed Endless Terminals, a pipeline generating tasks through four stages: task description creation, environment preparation, test generation, and solvability filtering. Vanilla PPO is used for training agents with binary rewards and minimal interaction loops.

Result: Agents trained using Endless Terminals achieve substantial performance improvements: models like Qwen2.5-7B saw gains from 10.7% to 53.3% on synthetic benchmarks, and similar notable improvements on human-curated benchmarks, outperforming alternative methods.

Conclusion: Endless Terminals demonstrates that simple RL frameworks can achieve superior results when scalable environments are provided, marking a step forward for autonomous agent training.

Abstract: Environments are the bottleneck for self-improving agents. Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds. These results demonstrate that simple RL succeeds when environments scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function for LSTM networks, which improves gradient propagation and learning stability especially for noisy financial time series, achieving better predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation functions like ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU struggle with gradient instability, particularly in handling noisy, non-stationary financial time series. A method to address this is needed.

Method: The authors propose BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function rooted in Brownian motion. It is tested using Monte Carlo simulations and applied within LSTM networks, evaluated on both financial time series and classification data.

Result: BrownianReLU resulted in consistent performance improvements with lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$, showcasing better predictive accuracy and generalization. It also showed significant sensitivity and accuracy adjustment in classification.

Conclusion: BrownianReLU enhances learning stability and achieves meaningful performance across tasks, making it a valuable choice for sequential modeling, particularly in financial time series.

Abstract: Deep learning models are effective for sequential data modeling, yet commonly used activation functions such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU often exhibit gradient instability when applied to noisy, non-stationary financial time series. This study introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function induced by Brownian motion that enhances gradient propagation and learning stability in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Using Monte Carlo simulation, BrownianReLU provides a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs, mitigating the dying ReLU problem. The proposed activation is evaluated on financial time series from Apple, GCB, and the S&P 500, as well as LendingClub loan data for classification. Results show consistently lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, indicating improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Although ROC-AUC metric is limited in classification tasks, activation choice significantly affects the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity, with Brownian ReLU and the selected activation functions yielding practically meaningful performance.

*Sejun Park,Yeachan Park,Geonho Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the representability of transformers with floating-point operations and discovers limitations such as their inability to represent all permutation-equivariant functions when sequence length increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on transformers assume ideal conditions like real parameters and exact operations, which differ from practical applications with floating-point parameters and inexact computations.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the limitations and representability of floating-point transformers, exploring their ability to represent non-permutation-equivariant and permutation-equivariant functions under bounded and large sequence lengths.

Result: Floating-point transformers can represent non-permutation-equivariant functions and represent all permutation-equivariant functions under bounded sequence length. However, they cannot achieve this when sequence lengths are large.

Conclusion: Floating-point transformers have a distinct representability behavior compared to ideal transformers, with limitations affected by sequence length and positional encodings.

Abstract: The study on the expressive power of transformers shows that transformers are permutation equivariant, and they can approximate all permutation-equivariant continuous functions on a compact domain. However, these results are derived under real parameters and exact operations, while real implementations on computers can only use a finite set of numbers and inexact machine operations with round-off errors. In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers.

### [151] [On the Effects of Adversarial Perturbations on Distribution Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16464)
*Yipei Wang,Zhaoying Pan,Xiaoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the tradeoff between adversarial robustness and distribution robustness, offering theoretical analysis and uncovering nuanced interactions involving feature separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the interaction and tradeoff between adversarial robustness and distribution robustness, which are crucial for reliable model performance but often conflict.

Method: The paper uses a theoretical analysis approach, focusing on models trained on perturbed data. It studies $ell_infty$ perturbations and the impact of feature separability on robustness.

Result: The findings reveal that $ell_infty$ perturbations on biased data can improve distribution robustness, and this gain persists on highly skewed data if simplicity bias leads to reliance on core features.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of considering feature separability in robustness tradeoffs, cautioning against oversights that can lead to incomplete conclusions on reliable performance.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness refers to a model's ability to resist perturbation of inputs, while distribution robustness evaluates the performance of the model under data shifts. Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\ell_\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel SSL framework, R-NCE, which integrates FreeSurfer features to discover biomarkers for Alzheimer's. It outperforms traditional and SSL methods and identifies biologically relevant traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find more sensitive, biologically grounded biomarkers for early Alzheimer's detection using structural MRI data without being limited to hand-crafted features.

Method: Developing R-NCE, a self-supervised learning framework that integrates FreeSurfer features and maximizes augmentation-invariant information.

Result: R-NCE surpasses traditional features and other SSL methods in disease prediction tasks and reveals genetic links to Alzheimer's-related processes.

Conclusion: R-NCE offers a significant advancement in biomarker discovery, combining computational and biological insights to enhance Alzheimer's research.

Abstract: Discovery of sensitive and biologically grounded biomarkers is essential for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural MRI is widely available but typically relies on hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness or volume. We ask whether self-supervised learning (SSL) can uncover more powerful biomarkers from the same data. Existing SSL methods underperform FreeSurfer-derived features in disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction. We introduce Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a new SSL framework that integrates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while maximizing additional augmentation-invariant information. R-NCE outperforms traditional features and existing SSL methods across multiple benchmarks, including AD conversion prediction. To assess biological relevance, we derive Brain Age Gap (BAG) measures and perform genome-wide association studies. R-NCE-BAG shows high heritability and associations with MAPT and IRAG1, with enrichment in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating sensitivity to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes.

### [153] [Robust Categorical Data Clustering Guided by Multi-Granular Competitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16491)
*Shenghong Cai,Yiqun Zhang,Xiaopeng Luo,Yiu-Ming Cheung,Hong Jia,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) method and its derivative Cluster Aggregation strategy (CAME) for robust and scalable clustering of categorical data by leveraging the data's nested granular cluster structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cluster analysis of categorical data faces challenges due to the inability to define distance spaces, as can be done with Euclidean distances for numerical data. This makes clustering sparse, discrete data and identifying nested granular clusters particularly complex.

Method: The authors propose the MGCPL algorithm, which allows clusters to interactively tune and converge in stages based on compactness. They combine this with the CAME strategy, encoding objects based on learned distributions from MGCPL before performing clustering on embeddings.

Result: Their approach, named MCDC, effectively handles multi-granular clustering structures, demonstrates robustness across various data domains, scales linearly for large data sets, and facilitates pre-partitioning for distributed computing.

Conclusion: MCDC is an effective, scalable, and robust clustering method suitable for categorical data and distributed computing tasks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods on public categorical data sets, as confirmed through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Data set composed of categorical features is very common in big data analysis tasks. Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.

*Zekai Chen,Kairui Yang,Xunkai Li,Henan Sun,Zhihan Zhang,Jia Li,Qiangqiang Dai,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes BoostFGL, a fairness-aware federated graph learning framework that uses boosting to improve fairness for disadvantaged node groups without compromising overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated graph learning methods show high overall accuracy but fail to address severe accuracy degradation for disadvantaged node groups, driven by label skew, topology confounding, and aggregation dilution.

Method: BoostFGL includes three mechanisms: client-side node boosting to emphasize underserved nodes, client-side topology boosting for better propagation emphasis, and server-side model boosting for enhanced aggregation of difficult updates.

Result: BoostFGL improves Overall-F1 by 8.43%, showing significant fairness gains and competitive overall performance compared to baseline methods, validated on 9 datasets.

Conclusion: BoostFGL effectively addresses fairness in federated graph learning, ensuring balanced performance improvements across node groups without degrading overall accuracy.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across decentralized subgraphs without exposing raw data. While existing FGL methods often achieve high overall accuracy, we show that this average performance can conceal severe degradation on disadvantaged node groups. From a fairness perspective, these disparities arise systematically from three coupled sources: label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding in message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. To address this, we propose \textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL. BoostFGL introduces three coordinated mechanisms: \ding{182} \emph{Client-side node boosting}, which reshapes local training signals to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; \ding{183} \emph{Client-side topology boosting}, which reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable yet underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; and \ding{184} \emph{Server-side model boosting}, which performs difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show that BoostFGL delivers substantial fairness gains, improving Overall-F1 by 8.43\%, while preserving competitive overall performance against strong FGL baselines.

*Jiaye Li,Gang Chen,Hang Xu,Shichao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive graph model design to improve kNN classification in artificial intelligence by achieving faster inference speeds without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address limitations of the kNN algorithm, specifically inefficiency in large-scale applications due to inference speed and accuracy trade-offs.

Method: The method integrates a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, offloading neighbor selection and weighting during training while utilizing adaptive neighbor counts for precise classification.

Result: The approach accelerates inference speeds while maintaining classification accuracy, showcasing superior performance against eight baselines on six datasets.

Conclusion: The solution provides a scalable and robust method to address kNN inference bottlenecks, setting a new paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.

Abstract: The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a cornerstone of non-parametric classification in artificial intelligence, yet its deployment in large-scale applications is persistently constrained by the computational trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Existing approximate nearest neighbor solutions accelerate retrieval but often degrade classification precision and lack adaptability in selecting the optimal neighborhood size (k). Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy. These findings offer a scalable, robust solution to the long-standing inference bottleneck of kNN, establishing a new structural paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.

*Enes Arda,Semih Cayci,Atilla Eryilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a shallow Transformer model and finds that its optimization scales efficiently with sample size but requires more memory for longer sequences compared to recurrent architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to delve into why Transformers are highly effective and explore their optimization landscape, especially compared to recurrent models.

Method: The authors analyze a Transformer with multiple independent heads in the kernel regime, using projected gradient descent for theoretical evaluation.

Result: They reveal that the required width scales logarithmically with sample size, the optimization error is independent of sequence length, and demonstrate these findings in teacher-student settings.

Conclusion: Transformers outperform recurrent architectures in optimization scaling and error independence of sequence length, though they trade off with higher memory requirements for longer sequences.

Abstract: Understanding why Transformers perform so well remains challenging due to their non-convex optimization landscape. In this work, we analyze a shallow Transformer with $m$ independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime. Our analysis reveals two main findings: (i) the width required for nonasymptotic guarantees scales only logarithmically with the sample size $n$, and (ii) the optimization error is independent of the sequence length $T$. This contrasts sharply with recurrent architectures, where the optimization error can grow exponentially with $T$. The trade-off is memory: to keep the full context, the Transformer's memory requirement grows with the sequence length. We validate our theoretical results numerically in a teacher-student setting and confirm the predicted scaling laws for Transformers.

### [157] [Rethinking Large Language Models For Irregular Time Series Classification In Critical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16516)
*Feixiang Zheng,Yu Wu,Cecilia Mascolo,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model ICU time series data, focusing on encoder design and multimodal alignment strategies. It highlights an encoder's importance for handling data irregularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding patterns in ICU time series data, which often exhibits irregularities and missing points, is critical. The study evaluates LLMs' potential and challenges for this purpose.

Method: They establish a testbed based on ICU datasets, comparing state-of-the-art LLM models with supervised and self-supervised learning methods. Encoders and alignment strategies were systematically assessed.

Result: Encoders explicitly designed for irregular time series significantly improved performance (AUPRC +12.8%), while refined alignment strategies showed modest gains (+2.9%). However, LLM-based methods required longer training and struggled in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for ICU time series tasks but face challenges like high training costs and limitations in data-scarce scenarios. Their practical deployment for irregular data requires further refinement.

Abstract: Time series data from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) provides critical information for patient monitoring. While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\%$ improvement over cross-attention. However, LLM-based methods require at least 10$\times$ longer training than the best-performing irregular supervised models, while delivering only comparable performance. They also underperform in data-scarce few-shot learning settings. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for irregular ICU time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DANCE, a new paradigm for text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) to address challenges in overhead, suboptimal performance, and interpretability by using round-wise condensation and evidence-based interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve federated graph learning (FGL) incorporating textual attributes (TAG-FGL), while addressing inefficiencies, suboptimal performance, and lack of interpretability stemming from current methods.

Method: DANCE introduces round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation to adaptively summarize multi-hop neighborhoods and retains provenance in evidence packs, ensuring interpretability and efficiency in TAG-FGL.

Result: DANCE achieves superior results, improving accuracy by 2.33% and reducing token usage by 33.42%, with only an 8% condensation ratio, across 8 TAG datasets.

Conclusion: DANCE effectively addresses TAG-FGL challenges, offering enhanced accuracy and interpretability while minimizing computational cost and maintaining traceability in predictions.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training on graph data across multiple clients. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \textbf{2.33\%} at an \textbf{8\%} condensation ratio, with \textbf{33.42\%} fewer tokens than baselines.

*Xianya Fang,Feiyang Ren,Xiang Chen,Yu Tian,Zhen Bi,Haiyang Yu,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses object hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by proposing SARE, a framework that stabilizes unlearning through geometric optimization and improves hallucination suppression effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models often hallucinate objects, which undermines their reliability. Existing unlearning methods fail due to structural fragility, as hallucinations reappear after lightweight relearning.

Method: The paper introduces SARE, a targeted min-max optimization framework with Targeted-SAM mechanism to flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. This ensures suppression of hallucinations even under parameter perturbations.

Result: SARE achieves significant improvements in erasure efficacy compared to baselines while maintaining general generation quality. Hallucination suppression remains stable even after parameter updates or lightweight relearning.

Conclusion: SARE effectively addresses the structural fragility of standard unlearning methods, ensuring prolonged suppression of hallucinations and enhancing reliability of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are powerful but prone to object hallucinations, which describe non-existent entities and harm reliability. While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization.

### [160] [A Collision-Free Hot-Tier Extension for Engram-Style Conditional Memory: A Controlled Study of Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16531)
*Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Collisions in Engram-style conditional memory have unexpected regularization benefits, and simply improving lookup precision doesn't consistently enhance outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if high-frequency key collisions are the bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory systems and explore their impact on training dynamics.

Method: Developed "Engram-Nine," a collision-free memory extension using a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) for frequent n-grams while preserving a multi-head hashed lookup as the cold-tier.

Result: Collision-free setups do not guarantee improved validation loss. Through analysis, collision noise appears to act as implicit regularization, aiding training dynamics within certain scenarios.

Conclusion: Lookup precision alone isn't the key issue; gating credit assignment and the regularization effect of collisions play significant roles in training outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate whether high-frequency key collisions are a primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory. To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.
  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent "hot-to-cold advantage flip" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.
  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.

*Xiaobin Li,Run Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study enhances UMAP, a popular dimensionality reduction method, by addressing its limitations in preserving manifold geometry. The improved method achieves more accurate data visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP struggles to preserve intrinsic manifold geometry due to the local Euclidean distance assumption, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse that hinder faithful visualizations.

Method: The method introduces Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior to reinforce critical edges and Jaccard similarity as a topological prior to ensure neighborhood consistency, creating the JORC-UMAP approach.

Result: JORC-UMAP demonstrates reduced structural errors like tearing and collapse, improved SVM accuracy, better triplet preservation scores, and computational efficiency on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: JORC-UMAP offers a geometry-aware version of UMAP, enhancing its ability to visualize high-dimensional data more faithfully, without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.

*Vasileios Sevetlidis,George Pavlidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diagnostic framework for understanding the memory dynamics of neural training, using a process tensor approach and back-flow distinguishability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled and model-agnostic tool to measure and analyze training memory effects and understand deviations from idealized Markov dynamics in practical SGD.

Method: The authors develop a simple two-step protocol to measure non-Markovianity during training through an increase of distinguishability metrics (like TV, JS, or Hellinger distances) on model outputs under specific experimental manipulations.

Result: The authors observed consistent positive back-flow of metrics certifying non-Markovianity, which was sensitive to optimizer state, data overlap, and training schedules, and disappeared under causal breaks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively diagnoses training memory effects, offering empirical guidance for evaluating and fine-tuning optimizers, data curricula, and schedules, and establishes a new perspective on SGD dynamics.

Abstract: This work proposes neural training as a \emph{process tensor}: a multi-time map that takes a sequence of controllable instruments (batch choices, augmentations, optimizer micro-steps) and returns an observable of the trained model. Building on this operational lens, we introduce a simple, model-agnostic witness of training memory based on \emph{back-flow of distinguishability}. In a controlled two-step protocol, we compare outcome distributions after one intervention versus two; the increase $Δ_{\mathrm{BF}} = D_2 - D_1>0$ (with $D\in\{\mathrm{TV}, \mathrm{JS}, \mathrm{H}\}$ measured on softmax predictions over a fixed probe set) certifies non-Markovianity. We observe consistent positive back-flow with tight bootstrap confidence intervals, amplification under higher momentum, larger batch overlap, and more micro-steps, and collapse under a \emph{causal break} (resetting optimizer state), directly attributing the effect to optimizer/data-state memory. The witness is robust across TV/JS/Hellinger, inexpensive to compute, and requires no architectural changes. We position this as a \emph{measurement} contribution: a principled diagnostic and empirical evidence that practical SGD deviates from the Markov idealization. An exploratory case study illustrates how the micro-level signal can inform curriculum orderings. "Data order matters" turns into a testable operator with confidence bounds, our framework offers a common stage to compare optimizers, curricula, and schedules through their induced training memory.

### [163] [Predicting Startup Success Using Large Language Models: A Novel In-Context Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16568)
*Abdurahman Maarouf,Alket Bakiaj,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative method called kNN-ICL, leveraging in-context learning with large language models to predict early-stage startup success in data-scarce conditions, achieving superior accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Venture capital firms struggle to predict early-stage startup success due to limited data, highlighting the need for improved methods that perform well in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: The authors propose kNN-ICL, an in-context learning framework using large language models, selecting relevant examples based on similarity without the requirement for traditional model training.

Result: Experimentation using Crunchbase data demonstrates that kNN-ICL exceeds the performance of supervised learning baselines and standard in-context learning, achieving reliable predictions with as few as 50 examples.

Conclusion: kNN-ICL effectively leverages a minimal dataset for accurate startup success predictions, introducing a valuable tool for venture capital decision-making in environments with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unique dataset combining Finnish railway operations with meteorological data, enabling insights into train delays and weather impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integrated datasets combining railway operational data with weather data for better understanding and prediction of train delays in Nordic regions.

Method: The dataset integrates railway operation metrics with weather data from environmental stations using spatial-temporal alignment and advanced preprocessing techniques like spatial fallback algorithms.

Result: The dataset includes 38.5 million observations with 28 engineered features. Analysis reveals strong seasonal trends in delays, particularly in winter, and demonstrates predictive capabilities using XGBoost regression achieving an MAE of 2.73 minutes.

Conclusion: The dataset is a comprehensive tool for research on train delays, weather impacts, and infrastructure resilience, supporting advanced machine learning applications in railway operations research.

Abstract: Train delays result from complex interactions between operational, technical, and environmental factors. While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability limitations of existing EGNNs, which struggle with computational inefficiencies when handling dense tensor operations and geometric feature construction.

Method: E2Former-V2 introduces Equivariant Axis-Aligned Sparsification (EAAS) that transforms dense tensor computations into efficient sparse operations, coupled with a custom hardware-aware node-centric attention mechanism implemented through a Triton kernel.

Result: E2Former-V2 achieves a 20x computational improvement in TFLOPS compared to standard implementations while maintaining predictive performance in 3D atomistic modeling on SPICE and OMol25 datasets.

Conclusion: Large-scale equivariant models, like E2Former-V2, can achieve both scalability and efficiency when implemented with well-designed algebraic sparsity and hardware-aware optimizations on accessible GPUs.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have become a widely used approach for modeling 3D atomistic systems. However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{A}xis-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\mathrm{SO}(3) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \textbf{20$\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms.

### [166] [Dual-Prototype Disentanglement: A Context-Aware Enhancement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16632)
*Haonan Yang,Jianchao Tang,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an auxiliary method (DPAD) to enhance time series forecasting models by enabling dynamic disentanglement and context-aware adaptation of temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting models often fail to dynamically separate complex temporal patterns and produce context-aware results; instead, they rely on static representations.

Method: The proposed DPAD framework introduces a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP) to capture both common and rare patterns, combined with a Dual-Path Context-aware routing mechanism and Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) for better specialization of prototype banks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently boosts forecasting models' performance and reliability on diverse real-world datasets when integrated.

Conclusion: DPAD enriches forecasting models by enabling them to dynamically disentangle and adapt to complex temporal patterns, significantly improving prediction accuracy and robustness across benchmarks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.

### [167] [Provably Robust Bayesian Counterfactual Explanations under Model Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16659)
*Jamie Duell,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Probabilistically Safe Counterfactual Explanations (PSCE) to create counterfactual explanations that remain valid despite model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanations often become invalid or unreliable when machine learning models are frequently updated, creating a need for robust explanations that perform well under such changes.

Method: The authors propose PSCE, based on Bayesian principles, which introduces probabilistic guarantees ($δ$-safe for high confidence and $ε$-robust for low variance) to ensure the robustness of counterfactuals. The method incorporates uncertainty-aware constraints into the optimization process.

Result: Empirical validation shows that PSCE generates counterfactual explanations that are more plausible, discriminative, and robust when compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian counterfactual methods.

Conclusion: PSCE provides a robust framework for generating counterfactual explanations, ensuring their validity and reliability under frequent model updates.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer interpretable insights into machine learning predictions by answering ``what if?" questions. However, in real-world settings where models are frequently updated, existing counterfactual explanations can quickly become invalid or unreliable. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $δ$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $ε$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\langle δ, ε\rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.

*Adrick Tench,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a flexible ensemble method that combines expert knowledge (like LLMs) with multiple causal discovery algorithms to address diverse, real-world challenges in identifying causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate causal modeling is crucial in healthcare for its role in understanding treatment effects, interpretability, and decision-making. The plethora of causal algorithms complicates practitioners' choices, necessitating an approach that handles algorithm diversity and real-world challenges.

Method: The authors introduce a model averaging technique that leverages expert knowledge dynamically (from sources like LLMs) to ensemble causal discovery algorithms, aiming to improve performance under real-world conditions, including noisy data.

Result: The method shows effectiveness—even with imperfect experts—via experiments in clean and noisy data contexts. It evaluates varying degrees of expert accuracy and the utility of LLMs in clinical causal discovery tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical ensemble strategy for causal discovery in complex real-world scenarios, demonstrating that even imperfect expert input (like LLMs) can enhance algorithm robustness and provide valuable insights for healthcare applications.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships is critical for healthcare. Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequential penalty method to handle strict constraints in optimization problems during learning tasks and proves convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios in learning tasks where processing requirements need strict constraints rather than arbitrary penalties.

Method: A sequential penalty method is proposed to manage constraints in optimization problems effectively, with theoretical convergence guarantees demonstrated.

Result: Experimental results on image processing tasks validate the practical viability of the method and its convergence properties in deep learning contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed method is both effective in theory and practical for real-world learning tasks, particularly for handling strict constraint scenarios.

Abstract: In many learning tasks, certain requirements on the processing of individual data samples should arguably be formalized as strict constraints in the underlying optimization problem, rather than by means of arbitrary penalties. We show that, in these scenarios, learning can be carried out exploiting a sequential penalty method that allows to properly deal with constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess convergence guarantees under assumptions that are reasonable in deep learning scenarios. Moreover, the results of experiments on image processing tasks show that the method is indeed viable to be used in practice.

### [170] [Calibrated Probabilistic Interpolation for GEDI Biomass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16834)
*Robin Young,Srinivasan Keshav*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs) for reliable biomass mapping on large landscapes, addressing issues in traditional machine learning methods' uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving the accuracy and uncertainty calibration of biomass mapping from sparse GEDI LiDAR observations across heterogeneous and complex landscapes, where traditional methods struggle.

Method: The authors propose ANPs, which use probabilistic meta-learning, local observation sets, and geospatial embeddings to provide flexible and spatially-aware predictions with better-calibrated uncertainty.

Result: ANPs were validated across five biomes, achieved competitive prediction accuracy, showed ideal uncertainty calibration, and demonstrated strong adaptability in cross-region transfers with minimal local data.

Conclusion: ANPs provide a scalable and robust method for biomass mapping that overcomes limitations of current ensemble-based approaches and is applicable at continental scale for Earth observation tasks.

Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.

TL;DR: The paper showcases how human collaboration with large language models (LLMs) can enhance algorithms and solve persistent problems in theoretical computer science, specifically combinatorial optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the synergy between human expertise and LLMs to derive solutions for long-standing challenges in combinatorial optimization.

Method: By iteratively refining outputs from the FunSearch algorithm using expert insights, the study improves constructions for various optimization problems.

Result: Improved adversarial instances were identified in problems like hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, knapsack problem, and Lovász's gasoline problem, surpassing benchmarks not improved for over a decade.

Conclusion: Human-LLM collaboration allows breakthrough results in theoretical computer science research, emphasizing the importance of combining computational insights with expert refinements.

Abstract: We demonstrate the power of human-LLM collaboration in tackling open problems in theoretical computer science. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lovász's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.
  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions. This work highlights that LLMs are a strong collaborative tool in mathematics and computer science research.

### [172] [Provably Learning Attention with Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16873)
*Satwik Bhattamishra,Kulin Shah,Michael Hahn,Varun Kanade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates learning Transformer-based sequence models through black-box output queries. It introduces query-efficient methods for single-head attention models, robust learning under oracle noise, and highlights parameter non-identifiability in multi-head attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning the parameters of Transformer models in a black-box setting by leveraging the outputs from adaptive queries.

Method: The paper develops algorithms for learning single-head attention regressors and extends them to Transformers. It uses compressed sensing for efficient query learning and analyzes robustness to noisy outputs. It also examines issues with multi-head attention parameter identifiability.

Result: Efficient algorithms are shown for learning single-head attention under certain conditions, even with noise. However, multi-head attention models exhibit non-identifiability, making exact learning infeasible without additional assumptions.

Conclusion: The study provides methodologies for learning single-head Transformers with limited queries and noise robustness but points out inherent limitations in multi-head attention learning.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Transformer-based sequence models with black-box access to their outputs. In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper derives minimal weight changes in DNNs for specific output shifts and compares them with robustness measures like Lipschitz constants. It applies this to backdoor attacks and highlights compression thresholds while analyzing layer-wise sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of how minimal weight changes affect DNN outputs and to establish robust guarantees for applications like backdoor attacks.

Method: Derive formulae for minimal weight perturbations, compare exact single-layer results to multi-layer Lipschitz robustness, and apply this to backdoor attack scenarios.

Result: Provided exact formulae for weight perturbations, established robustness guarantees, and demonstrated empirical success in low-rank compression activating backdoors while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings link layer-wise sensitivity to back-propagated margins and offer certifiable guarantees on minimal parameter updates for desired output changes.

Abstract: The minimal norm weight perturbations of DNNs required to achieve a specified change in output are derived and the factors determining its size are discussed. These single-layer exact formulae are contrasted with more generic multi-layer Lipschitz constant based robustness guarantees; both are observed to be of the same order which indicates similar efficacy in their guarantees. These results are applied to precision-modification-activated backdoor attacks, establishing provable compression thresholds below which such attacks cannot succeed, and show empirically that low-rank compression can reliably activate latent backdoors while preserving full-precision accuracy. These expressions reveal how back-propagated margins govern layer-wise sensitivity and provide certifiable guarantees on the smallest parameter updates consistent with a desired output shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings for crop type mapping in Senegal, identifying TESSERA as the most effective approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve satellite-based methods for crop type mapping, which are essential for food security, livelihoods, and climate mitigation, particularly in smallholder farming regions.

Method: A four-part evaluation criteria (performance, plausibility, transferability, accessibility) was applied to assess geospatial FM embeddings like TESSERA and AlphaEarth against baseline techniques.

Result: The TESSERA model demonstrated the best overall performance, including a 28% higher accuracy in a temporal transfer scenario than the second-best method.

Conclusion: TESSERA embeddings are effective and suitable for land cover and crop type mapping tasks in Senegal's smallholder farming regions.

Abstract: Crop type maps from satellite remote sensing are important tools for food security, local livelihood support and climate change mitigation in smallholder regions of the world, but most satellite-based methods are not well suited to smallholder conditions. To address this gap, we establish a four-part criteria for a useful embedding-based approach consisting of 1) performance, 2) plausibility, 3) transferability and 4) accessibility and evaluate geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings -based approaches using TESSERA and AlphaEarth against current baseline methods for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal. We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method. These results indicate that TESSERA embeddings are an effective approach for crop type classification and mapping tasks in Senegal.

*Andy Zhu,Rongzhe Wei,Yupu Gu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GRIP, a framework for properly implementing machine unlearning in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures by focusing on erasing knowledge from expert parameters rather than exploiting router vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine unlearning methods exploit architectural vulnerabilities in MoE models, causing a superficial forgetting of knowledge and degrading model utility.

Method: GRIP introduces a geometric constraint by projecting router parameter updates into expert-specific null space to ensure routing stability while enabling internal reconfiguration for effective unlearning.

Result: Experiments show that GRIP achieves over 95% routing stability in MoE models across various unlearning methods, preventing expert selection shift and preserving model utility.

Conclusion: GRIP adapts machine unlearning methods from dense architectures to MoE models by addressing their specific vulnerabilities, improving the unlearning process and retaining model effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.

*Calarina Muslimani,Yunshu Du,Kenta Kawamoto,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter Stone,Peter Wurman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates using the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC) to improve reward function design in reinforcement learning (RL), showcasing its utility in tuning rewards and training reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions in RL is time-consuming and prone to errors, motivating the need for tools to help practitioners create more effective reward functions.

Method: The paper uses TAC to evaluate reward function alignment with expert preferences. They conducted a user study with RL practitioners and proposed Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation, for training reward models from human preferences.

Result: Providing TAC improved practitioners' reward tuning outcomes and reduced cognitive workload. Additionally, Soft-TAC enabled the training of reward models that aligned better with expert preferences in a racing simulator.

Conclusion: TAC proves to be a valuable tool for reward tuning and learning, enhancing performance and capturing expert-specific objectives in RL tasks.

Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of systematic miscalibration in cosine similarity measures due to anisotropy in pretrained embedding spaces. It introduces isotonic regression as a solution to restore interpretability without altering ranking properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of absolute cosine similarity values in pretrained embedding spaces, which are systematically miscalibrated due to anisotropy and limit their usability as quantitative measures.

Method: The authors use isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments to apply a monotonic transformation. This preserves rank correlation and local stability while achieving near-perfect calibration.

Result: The proposed approach achieves 98% local stability across seven perturbation types, maintains rank correlation, and restores interpretability of cosine similarity as an absolute measure.

Conclusion: Isotonic calibration offers a method to fix the calibration of absolute similarity scores without altering ranking properties or modifying the embedding space, making cosine similarity more interpretable in its raw form.

Abstract: While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.
  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.
  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.

*Anton Zamyatin,Patrick Indri,Sagar Malhotra,Thomas Gärtner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BatchEnsemble, tested on various datasets, doesn't reach the performance level of Deep Ensembles in uncertainty estimation and behaves more like a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient uncertainty estimates are crucial in scenarios with limited resources and strict latency requirements, leading to the development of methods like BatchEnsemble to reduce memory and parameter costs.

Method: BatchEnsemble applies learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network to mimic ensemble-like behavior at reduced computational costs.

Result: BatchEnsemble underperforms compared to Deep Ensembles in accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection, and its members lack distinct predictive modes.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble does not adequately replicate the diversity or effectiveness of Deep Ensembles and functions more as a single model.

Abstract: In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve 3D molecular structure generation by simplifying the process using rigid-body motifs instead of individual atomic models, building on concepts from protein structure generation.

Method: The authors utilize SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling to generate 3D molecular structures from rigid motifs, leveraging a more compressed and efficient representation.

Result: The approach achieves comparable or superior benchmark results, surpasses atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, reduces generation steps by 2x-10x, and compresses molecular representation by 3.5x compared to atom-based methods.

Conclusion: Using rigid-body motifs and SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling provides a more efficient and effective framework for 3D molecular structure generation, improving performance and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap and training inefficiency of masked diffusion models compared to autoregressive models for language modeling.

Method: Proposes ARMD, a model designed as a block-wise causal architecture, enabling efficient parallel forward passes with autoregressive-style decoding and progressive permutation training.

Result: ARMD achieves state-of-the-art results on language modeling benchmarks, surpasses diffusion baselines, and bridges the gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

Conclusion: ARMD successfully enhances masked diffusion models, achieving high performance with fewer training steps while introducing efficient parallel text generation strategies.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

Method: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) were used to generate synthetic attack data to balance training datasets. The approach was tested against state-of-the-art methods, evaluating the quality of generated samples and IDS effectiveness.

Result: The proposed LDM method achieved substantially improved IDS performance, with F1-scores up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks, while reducing sampling time by 25% compared to traditional diffusion models.

Conclusion: Using LDMs for attack data augmentation offers an effective, scalable, and high-performance solution for mitigating class imbalance in IoT intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.

*Catalin-Viorel Dinu,Diederick Vermetten,Carola Doerr*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Allocating computational budget across multiple optimization algorithms outperforms relying on a single algorithm, with significant performance improvements observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization tasks often use a single algorithm due to user preferences or expert knowledge, but this may not utilize diverse algorithm benefits.

Method: Authors divide computational budgets across multiple algorithms sequentially, using data from the COCO archive on BBOB test suite.

Result: Sequential algorithm portfolios outperform single-algorithm baselines, with over 14% relative performance improvements.

Conclusion: Sequential portfolios enhance optimization by leveraging algorithm complementarity and variance reduction without requiring parallel evaluations.

Abstract: In typical black-box optimization applications, the available computational budget is often allocated to a single algorithm, typically chosen based on user preference with limited knowledge about the problem at hand or according to some expert knowledge. However, we show that splitting the budget across several algorithms yield significantly better results. This approach benefits from both algorithm complementarity across diverse problems and variance reduction within individual functions, and shows that algorithm portfolios do NOT require parallel evaluation capabilities. To demonstrate the advantage of sequential algorithm portfolios, we apply it to the COCO data archive, using over 200 algorithms evaluated on the BBOB test suite. The proposed sequential portfolios consistently outperform single-algorithm baselines, achieving relative performance gains of over 14%, and offering new insights into restart mechanisms and potential for warm-started execution strategies.

### [183] [Scalable Screw-Theoretic Synthesis for PDE-Based Dynamic Modeling of Multibody Flexible Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16242)
*S. Yaqubi,J. Mattila*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable framework utilizing screw theory for modeling dynamics of flexible robotic manipulators in 3D space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic and scalable approach for modeling the dynamics of serial robotic manipulators with flexible components in three-dimensional space.

Method: The framework uses screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links, enforces constraints via interaction forces, and formulates the dynamics mathematically as a differential-algebraic system.

Result: Establishes a scalable multibody representation capturing all dynamic states and demonstrates mathematical rigor through formulated equations and well-posedness of the system.

Conclusion: The proposed screw-theoretic framework provides a rigorous and efficient method for modeling robotic manipulators’ dynamics, capturing both local and global behaviors.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and scalable screw-theoretic multibody synthesis framework for PDE-based dynamic modeling of serial robotic manipulators with an arbitrary number of flexible links in three-dimensional space. The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established.

Result: Validated deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance via experiments on distributed hosts, supporting cooperative simulation.

Conclusion: The Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System demonstrates effective cooperative autonomous valet simulation and lays groundwork for real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validations.

Abstract: This paper presents the DMV-AVP System, a distributed simulation of Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

Method: A stochastic-cloning UD-factorized filter and delayed-state smoother are utilized for improved stability in processing TDCP measurements. A comprehensive dynamics and measurement model incorporates relativistic coupling, lunar-specific transformations, and signal propagation delays.

Result: Monte-Carlo simulations show the approach achieves meter-level orbit accuracy and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy with robust handling of errors and delays.

Conclusion: The framework meets stringent navigation accuracy requirements and paves the way for LANS, offering effective solutions for lunar satellite navigation under GNSS-based systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a terrestrial GNSS-based orbit and clock estimation framework for lunar navigation satellites. To enable high-precision estimation under the low-observability conditions encountered at lunar distances, we develop a stochastic-cloning UD-factorized filter and delayed-state smoother that provide enhanced numerical stability when processing precise time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. A comprehensive dynamics and measurement model is formulated, explicitly accounting for relativistic coupling between orbital and clock states, lunar time-scale transformations, and signal propagation delays including ionospheric, plasmaspheric, and Shapiro effects. The proposed approach is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating realistic multi-constellation GNSS geometry, broadcast ephemeris errors, lunar satellite dynamics, and ionospheric and plasmaspheric delay computed from empirical electron density models. Simulation results demonstrate that combining ionosphere-free pseudorange and TDCP measurements achieves meter-level orbit accuracy and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy, satisfying the stringent signal-in-space error requirements of future Lunar Augmented Navigation Services (LANS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CPP solutions neglect energy constraints, which can lead to incomplete tasks in large-scale or energy-constrained environments.

Method: The framework employs Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, integrated with CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal dynamics. A specialized reward function optimizes coverage, energy, and return-to-base.

Result: The proposed approach exceeds 90% coverage, surpassing traditional algorithms by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%.

Conclusion: This SAC-based framework is validated as a scalable and effective solution for energy-aware CPP in agricultural robotics, improving both coverage and energy constraint management.

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is a fundamental capability for agricultural robots; however, existing solutions often overlook energy constraints, resulting in incomplete operations in large-scale or resource-limited environments. This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%.

Method: Develop a platform integrating simulation, digital twin, and physical testbed for zero-shot evaluation of MARL policies; deploy SigmaRL-trained policies to assess sim-to-real transfer performance.

Result: Policy performance degrades due to architectural differences and increased environmental realism between simulation and physical domains.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation platform enables systematic analysis of sim-to-real challenges, advancing reproducibility in MARL research for CAVs.

Abstract: We present a reproducible benchmark for evaluating sim-to-real transfer of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) policies for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The platform, based on the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (CPM Lab) [1], integrates simulation, a high-fidelity digital twin, and a physical testbed, enabling structured zero-shot evaluation of MARL motion-planning policies. We demonstrate its use by deploying a SigmaRL-trained policy [2] across all three domains, revealing two complementary sources of performance degradation: architectural differences between simulation and hardware control stacks, and the sim-to-real gap induced by increasing environmental realism. The open-source setup enables systematic analysis of sim-to-real challenges in MARL under realistic, reproducible conditions.

### [190] [A Unified Calibration Framework for High-Accuracy Articulated Robot Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16638)
*Philip Tobuschat,Simon Duenser,Markus Bambach,Ivo Aschwanden*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified approach for static calibration of industrial robots, addressing both geometric and non-geometric errors using a single data collection experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compensation strategies for robot tool positioning errors require separate models and experiments, which are specialized and time-consuming. This motivates the need for a streamlined, unified calibration approach.

Method: The researchers use a robot model with virtual joints to account for various effects (geometric, compliant bending, thermal deformation, and gear errors). The model is optimized using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients and evaluated using Fisher information spectra and cross-validation.

Result: The proposed model achieves a significant improvement in accuracy, reducing the mean position error to 26.8 μm compared to 102.3 μm for purely geometric calibration, tested on a KUKA KR30 robot.

Conclusion: The unified calibration method is robust, efficient, and achieves high accuracy for industrial robots, making it a viable alternative to traditional calibration techniques.

Abstract: Researchers have identified various sources of tool positioning errors for articulated industrial robots and have proposed dedicated compensation strategies. However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration.

### [191] [ReViP: Reducing False Completion in Vision-Language-Action Models with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16667)
*Zhuohao Li,Yinghao Li,Jian-Jian Jiang,Lang Zhou,Tianyu Zhang,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReViP, a new framework to address modality imbalance in robotic manipulation by rebalancing vision and proprioception using task-aware priors and a feature modulation technique, significantly reducing false completions and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models struggle with state-dominant bias, leading to reliance on internal sensors over visual cues and visible failures in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: ReViP uses task-aware environment priors, employs external Vision-Language Models (VLM) as task observers for real-time visual cues, and applies Vision-Proprioception Feature-Wise Linear Modulation to couple semantic perception with proprioceptive dynamics.

Result: ReViP significantly reduces false-completion rates and outperforms strong baselines in various benchmarks, including LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The ReViP framework effectively addresses modality imbalance, enhances visual grounding, and achieves better task performance in robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by combining vision, language, and proprioception to predict actions. However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.

*Lucía Güitta-López,Lionel Güitta-López,Jaime Boal,Álvaro Jesús López-López*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of transferring deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies trained in virtual environments to real-world applications, proposing a new GAN-based method to bridge the sim-to-real gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of deep reinforcement learning adoption in industrial applications, which stem from the high cost and time demands of real-world training and the difficulty of bridging the sim-to-real gap for practical deployment.

Method: The authors introduce the Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (SICGAN), which generates hybrid domains for DRL by translating virtual observations into realistic synthetic images. This enables agents trained virtually to directly transfer to real-world environments without additional tuning.

Result: The pipeline was validated using two industrial robot setups for a pick-and-place task. Success rates of 90-100% were achieved in virtual environments, and real-world deployment demonstrated robust zero-shot transfer with above 95% accuracy in most areas.

Conclusion: The proposed SICGAN-based pipeline offers an efficient and scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem, enabling zero-shot transfers of agents to real-world tasks with practical accuracy.

Abstract: The sample efficiency challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) compromises its industrial adoption due to the high cost and time demands of real-world training. Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\textsuperscript{\textregistered}~cubes and a mug. These results establish the proposed pipeline as an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARMS, a hybrid reinforcement learning and control framework for human-guided mobile robots, achieving higher success rates and lower computation time in cluttered environments compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create a robust framework for human-guided navigation of collaborative robots while handling safety and proximity constraints in partial observability and non-stationary human motion scenarios.

Method: Develop a hybrid Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS) framework that combines PPO-based RL follower with an MPC safety filter and a neural switcher for context-aware action fusion.

Result: ARMS achieved an 82.5% success rate in cluttered environments, outperforming benchmarks like DWA and RL-only methods by 7.1% and 3.1%, respectively, while also reducing computational latency by 33%.

Conclusion: ARMS demonstrates superior efficiency and safety in human-robot interaction through its hybrid learning-control approach, showing potential for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of human-guided navigation for mobile collaborative robots under simultaneous proximity regulation and safety constraints. We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new biologically accurate spider robot with eight legs and improved leg morphology is developed to study vibration sensing during prey detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how spiders use leg crouching for prey sensing is unclear, as measuring vibrations in live animals is challenging.

Method: A spider-like robotic model with eight legs, 3D-printed leg exoskeletons, customizable joint stiffness, and integrated accelerometers was designed and tested for vibration analysis.

Result: The updated robot replicated previously observed vibrational features while achieving closer alignment with biological spiders' structure and function.

Conclusion: The robot is a better tool for studying leg-induced effects on vibration sensing, offering deeper biological insights.

Abstract: Orb-weaving spiders detect prey on a web using vibration sensors at leg joints. They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a feature extraction pipeline using sEMG signals to predict joint torques for exoskeletons in rehabilitation. Testing shows good results using two neural network models, demonstrating effectiveness with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting user joint torques is essential for personalized exoskeleton assistance during rehabilitation.

Method: The authors developed a feature extraction pipeline for 8-channel sEMG signals and tested it with MLP and TCN neural networks on data collected during elbow and shoulder joint movements under different loads.

Result: The proposed pipeline enabled the MLP model to achieve RMSE errors of 0.963 N m (elbow), 1.403 N m (front-shoulder), and 1.434 N m (side-shoulder), comparable to TCN performance.

Conclusion: This feature extraction approach allows simple MLP models to perform well, even with limited training data, making it valuable for rehabilitation scenarios.

Abstract: Robot-assisted rehabilitation offers an effective approach, wherein exoskeletons adapt to users' needs and provide personalized assistance. However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care.

Result: Experimental results show a 60% reduction in learning time and a 15 percentage point improvement in task accuracy without additional computational complexity.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic knowledge can significantly reduce sample complexity and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of DRL in robotic applications.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful framework for solving complex sequential decision-making problems, particularly in robotic control. However, its practical deployment is often hindered by the substantial amount of experience required for learning, which results in high computational and time costs. In this work, we propose a novel integration of DRL with semantic knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), aiming to enhance learning efficiency by providing contextual information to the agent. Our architecture combines KGEs with visual observations, enabling the agent to exploit environmental knowledge during training. Experimental validation with robotic manipulators in environments featuring both fixed and randomized target attributes demonstrates that our method achieves up to {60}{\%} reduction in learning time and improves task accuracy by approximately 15 percentage points, without increasing training time or computational complexity. These results highlight the potential of semantic knowledge to reduce sample complexity and improve the effectiveness of DRL in robotic applications.

### [197] [A Multimodal Data Collection Framework for Dialogue-Driven Assistive Robotics to Clarify Ambiguities: A Wizard-of-Oz Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16870)
*Guangping Liu,Nicholas Hawkins,Billy Madden,Tipu Sultan,Flavio Esposito,Madi Babaiasl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for gathering multimodal data to improve the control of wheelchairs and wheelchair-mounted robotic arms, addressing gaps in intuitive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to improve independence for users with severe motor limitations, highlighting the current lack of datasets for intuitive, dialogue-driven control in assistive robotics.

Method: A dialogue-based interaction protocol and Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) simulation were used to collect multimodal data across five synchronized modalities during assistive tasks.

Result: A pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants was successfully collected and validated for quality using motion smoothness analysis and user feedback.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures conversational ambiguities and natural human-robot interaction, proving its potential for scalability to larger datasets for developing ambiguity-aware assistive systems.

Abstract: Integrated control of wheelchairs and wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) has strong potential to increase independence for users with severe motor limitations, yet existing interfaces often lack the flexibility needed for intuitive assistive interaction. Although data-driven AI methods show promise, progress is limited by the lack of multimodal datasets that capture natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly conversational ambiguity in dialogue-driven control. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control.

*André Brandão,Diogo Matos,Miguel Guimarães,Simão Cunha,João Saraiva*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An empirical study shows LuaJIT compilers outperform standard Lua interpreters in energy efficiency and runtime, demonstrating substantial benefits of JIT compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the importance of energy-efficient software in reducing the global carbon footprint and examine the efficiency of Lua compared to greener programming languages.

Method: Analyze 25 Lua interpreter versions and JIT compilers using benchmarks to measure execution time and energy consumption, comparing Lua's performance evolution and efficiency against other languages.

Result: LuaJIT compilers are significantly more efficient than standard interpreters, consuming seven times less energy and running seven times faster, nearing C's efficiency.

Conclusion: JIT compilation substantially enhances performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages like Lua, making it a promising direction for sustainable software development.

Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the importance of energy-efficient software to reduce the global carbon footprint. Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.
  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.

*Bing Xu,Terry Chen,Fengzhe Zhou,Tianqi Chen,Yangqing Jia,Vinod Grover,Haicheng Wu,Wei Liu,Craig Wittenbrink,Wen-mei Hwu,Roger Bringmann,Ming-Yu Liu,Luis Ceze,Michael Lightstone,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VIBETENSOR, an AI-generated deep learning software stack, features a PyTorch-like tensor library, GPU support, and advanced performance benchmarks, showcasing AI capabilities in software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using AI agents to autonomously develop a comprehensive and efficient deep learning runtime system.

Method: The system was created and validated entirely by AI coding agents with human guidance using iterative diff proposals, automated builds, and rigorous tests without manual code review for individual changes.

Result: VIBETENSOR blends language bindings, CUDA memory management, and offers scalability in GPU-supported architectures. It delivers reproducible benchmarks and practical training validations for deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: AI can effectively develop and validate complex software systems, but challenges like suboptimal performance due to autonomous component integration must be addressed.

Abstract: VIBETENSOR is an open-source research system software stack for deep learning, generated by LLM-powered coding agents under high-level human guidance. In this paper, "fully generated" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support. Finally, we discuss failure modes in generated system software, including a "Frankenstein" composition effect where locally correct subsystems interact to yield globally suboptimal performance.

### [200] [Combining Tests and Proofs for Better Software Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16239)
*Li Huang,Bertrand Meyer,Manuel Oriol*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the complementary relationship between testing and proving in software verification, leveraging Design by Contract and modern SMT tools for tasks like automated testing, regression test creation, and program repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To blend the strengths of software testing and proving to create more reliable techniques for software verification and maintenance.

Method: The authors use Eiffel's Design by Contract and SMT counterexample generation to facilitate testing, produce regression tests, and guarantee correct program fixes.

Result: The proposed methods provide automatic test generation, full regression test coverage, and mechanisms to correct faulty programs with guaranteed correctness.

Conclusion: Testing and proving are complementary approaches that, when combined effectively, can address critical challenges in software verification and maintenance, leading to higher quality and more reliable software.

Abstract: Test or prove? These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.
  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation. We can also introduce faults into a correct program and turn the counterexamples into an automatically generated regression test suite with full coverage. Additionally, we can use these mechanisms to help produce program fixes for incorrect programs, with a guarantee that the fixes are correct. All three applications, leveraging on the mechanisms of Eiffel and Design by Contract, hold significant promise to address some of the challenges of program testing, software maintenance and Automatic Program Repair.

### [201] [Identifying Concurrency Bug Reports via Linguistic Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16338)
*Shuai Shao,Lu Xiao,Tingting Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using linguistic patterns coupled with machine learning methods to automatically identify and classify concurrency bug reports with high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenge of efficiently and accurately identifying concurrency bug reports in issue tracking systems, given their crucial importance in multi-core architecture environments.

Method: The study derives 58 linguistic patterns categorized into four levels and evaluates their effectiveness through matching, learning, prompt-based techniques, and fine-tuning PLMs, using data from GitHub and Jira.

Result: A fine-tuning strategy integrating linguistic patterns into PLMs showed the best precision results: 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, effectively maintaining accuracy even with new, unseen data.

Conclusion: By presenting a taxonomy of linguistic patterns, an enhanced fine-tuning method, and a curated dataset, the paper advances automated classification methods, ensuring higher precision and interpretability for concurrency bug reports.

Abstract: With the growing ubiquity of multi-core architectures, concurrent systems have become essential but increasingly prone to complex issues such as data races and deadlocks. While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research. Together, these advances provide a foundation for improving the automation, precision, and interpretability of concurrency bug classification.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes deep structural dynamics in the software engineering research ecosystem, proposing a holistic framework for reform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges such as overloaded review processes, distorted incentives, AI pressures, and publication scams in software engineering research.

Method: Introduction of a holistic framework informed by complex systems, ecosystems, and theory of change to understand and address SE research dysfunctions.

Result: Reveals feedback loops sustaining dysfunctions and identifies ecosystem-wide leverage points for coordinated reforms.

Conclusion: Effective progress requires system-level thinking and coordinated changes across the SE research ecosystem rather than isolated fixes.

Abstract: The software engineering research community is productive, yet it faces a constellation of challenges: swamped review processes, metric-driven incentives, distorted publication practices, and increasing pressures from AI, scale, and outright scams. These issues are often treated in isolation, yet they arise from deep structural dynamics within the research ecosystem itself and distract us from the larger role of research in society. Meaningful progress requires a holistic system-level view. We sketch such a framework drawing on ideas from complex systems, ecosystems, and theory of change. Reframing SE's challenges through this lens reveals non-linear feedback loops that sustain current dysfunctions, and it helps to identify leverage points for reform. These are less a matter of isolated fixes and more a matter of exploring coordinated sets of fixes that operate across the SE ecosystem

TL;DR: The paper discusses "Agentic Project Manager" as a multi-agent system under Software Engineering 3.0, focusing on its collaborative role with human teams and ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt software project management for the era of agentic AI, ensuring successful projects while integrating AI ethically and effectively.

Method: Proposing the "Agentic PM" framework with four autonomy modes, emphasizing human-centric collaboration and role evolution.

Result: The vision of an agentic PM is outlined, addressing trust, ethics, and accountability, alongside human role evolution in project management.

Conclusion: A foundation for agentic SPM research is established with a research agenda for the community to further explore this area.

Abstract: With the advent of agentic AI, Software Engineering is transforming to a new era dubbed Software Engineering 3.0. Software project management (SPM) must also evolve with such transformations to boost successful project completion, while keeping humans at the heart of it. Building on our preliminary ideas of "agentic SPM", and supporting literature, we present our vision of an "Agentic Project Manager (PM)" as a multi-agent system for SPM 3.0. They will work like a "junior project manager", or an "intern project manager" collaboratively with software teams. We introduce four working modes, with varying autonomy levels to choose from, based on the SPM task. This addresses concerns with ethics, accountability, and trust related to agentic PMs. We also share insights on human PM role evolution and new skill requirements as a "strategic leader" and a "coach" for humans and agents. While creating the foundation for agentic SPM research, we present a research agenda for the wider research community.

TL;DR: RubberDuckBench benchmark evaluates AI coding assistants' ability to answer contextualized programming questions from real-world Github pull requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI coding assistants lack robust evaluation metrics for answering questions about programming code, necessitating a standardized benchmark.

Method: The authors curated contextualized programming questions from Github pull requests and assessed 20 LLMs for accuracy and consistency using detailed rubrics.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Grok 4, Claude Opus 4, and GPT-5 showed limited performance (best overall at ~69%) and an average hallucination rate of 58.3%, with no evident correlation between cost and accuracy.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights current challenges in producing trustworthy and correct AI coding assistants, aiming to drive further research in this area.

Abstract: Programmers are turning to AI coding assistants to answer questions about their code. Benchmarks are needed to soundly evaluate these systems and understand their performance. To enable such a study, we curate a benchmark of real-world contextualized questions derived from Github pull request comments. Out of this work, we present RubberDuckBench: a multilingual benchmark of questions about code, along with detailed rubrics for evaluating answers. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 LLMs (proprietary & open-source) on answering these questions. We find that even state of the art models fail to give consistent, correct responses across the benchmark. Grok 4 (69.29%), Claude Opus 4 (68.5%), and GPT-5 (67.8%) perform best overall, but do not exhibit pairwise significant superiority over the next 9 best performing models. Most models obtain points through partial credit, with the best performing models only answering at most 2 questions completely correctly across all trials. Furthermore, models often hallucinate with lies in 58.3\% of responses on average. Cost analysis reveals no correlation between expense (API pricing or parameter count) and performance. We intend this benchmark to be a target for future research in trustworthy and correct AI coding assistants.

*Wenbo Guo,Shiwen Song,Jiaxun Guo,Zhengzi Xu,Chengwei Liu,Haoran Ou,Mengmeng Ge,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IntelGuard is a framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and expert knowledge to detect malicious code in open-source ecosystems with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of supply chain attacks on open-source ecosystems such as NPM and PyPI requires better detection methods that go beyond fragile rules and poorly adapting data-driven features.

Method: IntelGuard uses a structured knowledge base linking malicious code snippets to behavioral descriptions and retrieves examples for analysis. It incorporates LLM-guided reasoning to compare code behaviors and intentions.

Result: IntelGuard achieved 99% accuracy with a 0.50% false positive rate in experiments on 4,027 packages and 96.5% accuracy on obfuscated code, while detecting 54 unreported malicious packages on PyPI.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable, robust, and expert-guided malicious package detection, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying threats in open-source repositories.

Abstract: Open-source ecosystems such as NPM and PyPI are increasingly targeted by supply chain attacks, yet existing detection methods either depend on fragile handcrafted rules or data-driven features that fail to capture evolving attack semantics. We present IntelGuard, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based framework that integrates expert analytical reasoning into automated malicious package detection. IntelGuard constructs a structured knowledge base from over 8,000 threat intelligence reports, linking malicious code snippets with behavioral descriptions and expert reasoning. When analyzing new packages, it retrieves semantically similar malicious examples and applies LLM-guided reasoning to assess whether code behaviors align with intended functionality. Experiments on 4,027 real-world packages show that IntelGuard achieves 99% accuracy and a 0.50% false positive rate, while maintaining 96.5% accuracy on obfuscated code. Deployed on PyPI.org, it discovered 54 previously unreported malicious packages, demonstrating interpretable and robust detection guided by expert knowledge.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoConfig introduces an efficient configuration framework for creating executable environments to aid large language models in software tasks, outperforming previous methods in error handling and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current inefficiency in large-scale environment configuration due to inadequate error analysis limits its reliability for complex setups.

Method: EvoConfig uses a multi-agent collaboration framework with an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained error analysis and a self-evolving mechanism for dynamic error-priority adjustments.

Result: EvoConfig matches state-of-the-art performance on simpler tasks and outperforms on more challenging cases, achieving a 78.1% success rate and showing superior debugging capabilities.

Conclusion: EvoConfig advances the reliability and efficiency of executable environments, particularly in challenging scenarios, while offering superior error diagnostics and corrections.

Abstract: A reliable executable environment is the foundation for ensuring that large language models solve software engineering tasks. Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods.

*Junjie Shi,Weisong Sun,Zhenpeng Chen,Zhujun Wu,Xiaohong Chen,Zhi Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces REprompt, a multi-agent framework to optimize prompts for large language models in software development by applying principles from requirements engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of designing efficient prompts for large language models arises from the need for expertise in both prompt engineering and requirements engineering, a gap that automated methods have yet to fully address.

Method: The authors propose REprompt, a framework leveraging requirements engineering methodologies to guide the optimization of system and user prompts in a multi-agent setup.

Result: Experimental results show that REprompt improves the quality of prompts, ensuring their alignment with requirements engineering principles and better addressing practical software development needs.

Conclusion: REprompt bridges the gap between prompt engineering and requirements engineering, enhancing the efficacy of automated prompt generation in coding scenarios involving large language models.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models is transforming software development. Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles.

*Monika Gupta,Ajay Meena,Anamitra Roy Choudhury,Vijay Arya,Srikanta Bedathur*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how code comments affect LLM-based code translation and introduces COMMENTRA, a method using comments to enhance translation accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the absence of code comments in benchmarks and their potential impact on code translation quality by LLMs.

Method: A large-scale study was conducted using over 80,000 translations of 1100+ code samples, comparing translations with and without comments across five programming languages.

Result: Code comments that describe the overall purpose of code, rather than line-by-line functionality, substantially enhance translation accuracy.

Conclusion: COMMENTRA, a proposed method, doubles LLM-based code translation performance and is the first comprehensive study to improve code translation accuracy using comments.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era in automated code translation across programming languages. Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.

*Michael Mircea,Emre Gevrek,Elisa Schmid,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist stakeholders in articulating requirements, illustrating that LLMs improve clarity, alignment, and understanding of intended requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges stakeholders face in articulating clear requirements due to limited domain knowledge or cognitive barriers, exacerbating misalignment during elicitation and validation.

Method: A study involving 26 participants asked them to express requirements independently and then review LLM-generated revisions. These were evaluated based on alignment, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity.

Result: Participants rated LLM-generated revisions significantly higher across all evaluation dimensions. Qualitative feedback revealed LLM revisions added tacit details and enhanced stakeholder understanding of their own requirements.

Conclusion: Using LLMs as articulation aids improves requirements clarity, completeness, and alignment while maintaining stakeholder involvement, fostering responsible AI use in requirements engineering.

Abstract: Stakeholders often struggle to accurately express their requirements due to articulation barriers arising from limited domain knowledge or from cognitive constraints. This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the adoption of generative AI tools among German software engineers, highlighting experience levels, organizational size, and regulatory constraints as key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the factors influencing the adoption and effective use of generative AI tools in software engineering within a regulated, localized context like Germany.

Method: A mixed-methods approach: 18 exploratory interviews and a survey of 109 software developers in Germany to identify adoption patterns and influencing factors.

Result: Findings reveal that experience level impacts perceived benefits, productivity gains vary among developers, organizational size influences tool adoption and usage, and lack of project context awareness is a major barrier.

Conclusion: The study provides action-oriented recommendations for developers, organizations, and tool vendors to optimize AI-assisted software development within regulatory and organizational constraints.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have seen rapid adoption among software developers. While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating and using REST API guidelines effectively, given their importance in API usability and organizational success, and to better understand these through empirical evidence.

Method: Conducted an interview study with 16 industry experts to gather insights on the usability, adoption, and creation of REST API guidelines.

Result: Identified eight factors affecting REST API usability, with adherence to conventions being the most critical. Developers resist strict guidelines, and factors like guideline size and organizational alignment are paramount.

Conclusion: Effective REST API guidelines need stakeholder involvement, adaptability with organizational growth, and tools like automated linting to enforce and justify guidelines effectively.

Abstract: REST is today's most widely used architectural style for providing web-based services. In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.
  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.

### [212] [SWE-Pruner: Self-Adaptive Context Pruning for Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16746)
*Yuhang Wang,Yuling Shi,Mo Yang,Rongrui Zhang,Shilin He,Heng Lian,Yuting Chen,Siyu Ye,Kai Cai,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Pruner is a context compression framework for coding agents, achieving significant token reductions with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents face inefficiencies due to long interaction contexts, especially in software development, leading to high costs and latency.

Method: SWE-Pruner uses a task-aware adaptive pruning method where agents dynamically select relevant code lines guided by explicit goals formed for each task.

Result: Evaluations demonstrated SWE-Pruner achieves up to 54% token reduction and significant compression (up to 14.84x) across benchmarks with negligible performance loss.

Conclusion: SWE-Pruner provides an efficient solution for coding agents by enhancing context management without sacrificing accuracy or integrity.

Abstract: LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software development, but their performance is hampered by long interaction contexts, which incur high API costs and latency. While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.

### [213] [Variability-Aware Detection and Repair of Compilation Errors Using Foundation Models in Configurable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16755)
*Rohit Gheyi,Lucas Albuquerque,Márcio Ribeiro,Eduardo Almeida,Danyllo Albuquerque,Mirko Perkusich*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of foundation models to identify and fix variability-induced compilation errors in configurable C systems, finding them effective and practical compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying and repairing variability-induced errors in configurable software systems, which are often missed by traditional compilers and variability-aware tools due to high complexity or cost.

Method: The study evaluates GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, comparing them with TYPECHEF on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, using empirical experiments to measure precision, recall, and fix accuracy.

Result: GPT-OSS-20B achieved high precision (0.97), recall (0.90), and accuracy (0.94) on small systems, detected faults in real GitHub commits, and provided fixes in over 70% of cases, outperforming and complementing existing tools like TYPECHEF.

Conclusion: Foundation models like GPT-OSS-20B present a low-effort, effective alternative for detecting and addressing variability-induced compilation errors, offering enhanced practicality in real-world software systems.

Abstract: Modern software systems often rely on conditional compilation to support optional features and multiple deployment scenarios. In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.

### [214] [Will It Survive? Deciphering the Fate of AI-Generated Code in Open Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16809)
*Musfiqur Rahman,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the longevity and modification rates of AI-generated code versus human code in software development, finding that AI-authored code generally survives longer but exhibits slightly different modification patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the prevailing belief that AI-generated code is disposable and to assess its long-term viability compared to human-authored code.

Method: The study conducts survival analysis on 201 open-source projects, analyzing over 200,000 code units by AI agents and humans. It uses statistical metrics to compare modification rates and hazard ratios, and evaluates the predictability of modification timing.

Result: AI-authored code shows a significantly lower modification rate and hazard of modification compared to human code. However, it has slightly higher corrective modification rates, and textual features slightly help in predicting modification-prone code, though prediction remains challenging.

Conclusion: The notion that AI-generated code is disposable is unfounded. The bottleneck for AI-authored code lies in organizational practices, not code quality, influencing its long-term evolution.

Abstract: The integration of AI agents as coding assistants into software development has raised questions about the long-term viability of AI agent-generated code. A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is "disposable", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the impact of AI coding agents on build systems' code quality using the AIDev dataset of agent-authored pull requests. Results highlight quality issues, improvements, and widespread acceptance of such pull requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the largely unexplored impact of AI coding agents on the maintainability and quality of build systems within real-world software development.

Method: The research utilizes the AIDev dataset and investigates three specific research questions concerning build code quality issues, remediation of code smells, and developer acceptance for Agentic-PRs.

Result: 364 build smells were identified, with varying severity, showing AI's dual role in introducing quality issues and eliminating some existing ones. Over 61% of Agentic-PRs were approved and merged with minimal intervention.

Conclusion: AI coding agents impact both positively and negatively on build systems, necessitating future research for systematic evaluation and governance of their contributions to build code quality.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI coding agents for software development has raised important questions about the quality and maintainability of the code they produce. While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention. This dual impact underscores the need for future research on AI-aware build code quality assessment to systematically evaluate, guide, and govern AI-generated build systems code.

*Ian Gauk,Doriane Olewicki,Joshua Romoff,Cor-Paul Bezemer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a selective instrumentation approach for code coverage in AAA game engines, maintaining low performance overhead and test stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strict performance requirements of AAA game engines conflict with high-overhead instrumentation for testing, necessitating a low-overhead and stable solution.

Method: The authors propose a selective instrumentation approach targeting critical components relevant to developer commits, integrating it into an industrial game testing pipeline.

Result: The approach significantly reduces the overhead—doubling build time only after 2,000 commits—and maintains over 50% baseline performance in the worst-case scenario, without automated test failures.

Conclusion: Commit- and build-level coverage for large C++ game engines can be achieved efficiently and stably, making it practical and effective for industrial use.

Abstract: Code coverage is a valuable guide for testing, but in AAA games the overhead of instrumentation conflicts with strict performance requirements and can destabilize automated tests. We propose and assess a selective instrumentation approach tailored to large game engines written in \texttt{C++}, which reduces the scope of instrumentation while preserving relevant coverage data to developer commits. Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\% of the non-instrumented baseline. Across two production test suites maintained by our industry partner, our framework caused no automated test failures, avoiding the instability observed under full instrumentation. Our work shows that commit-level or build-level coverage of large \texttt{C++} game engines can be achieved with minimal overhead and without compromising test stability.

TL;DR: The study investigates the neural coupling of motor units in targeted reinnervated muscles post-limb amputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how neural signals and motor unit behavior adapt following targeted muscle reinnervation after limb amputation.

Method: Using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays, researchers analyzed motor unit recruitment in reinnervated muscles during agonist and antagonist tasks.

Result: Motor units were found to be functionally coupled, showing activity in both agonist and antagonist tasks without visual feedback on coactivation.

Conclusion: Despite neuromechanical disruptions, neural coupling remains active, suggesting intrinsic connectivity in motor control systems post TMR surgery.

Abstract: Following limb amputation and targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), nerves supplying agonist and antagonist muscles are rerouted into separate targeted muscles, disrupting natural neuromechanical coupling between muscle groups. Using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays in reinnervated muscles, we show that neural signals for agonist and antagonist tasks remain functionally coupled: motor units active during agonist tasks were also recruited during corresponding antagonist tasks, despite no visual feedback on coactivation being provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating computational graphs when inputs are probability distributions, and understanding the impact of discretization errors during these approximations.

Method: The authors analyze non-asymptotic error bounds caused by discretization in computational graphs, specifically using the Wasserstein-1 distance metric.

Result: Established non-asymptotic error bounds for distributional computational graphs without requiring structural assumptions on the graph.

Conclusion: The paper contributes insights into understanding and bounding discretization errors within distributional computational graphs, ensuring reliability for input approximations.

Abstract: We study a general framework of distributional computational graphs: computational graphs whose inputs are probability distributions rather than point values. We analyze the discretization error that arises when these graphs are evaluated using finite approximations of continuous probability distributions. Such an approximation might be the result of representing a continuous real-valued distribution using a discrete representation or from constructing an empirical distribution from samples (or might be the output of another distributional computational graph). We establish non-asymptotic error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-1 distance, without imposing structural assumptions on the computational graph.

### [219] [Perfect Clustering for Sparse Directed Stochastic Block Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16427)
*Behzad Aalipur,Yichen Qin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a non-spectral two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse, directed stochastic block models (SBMs) with potentially growing communities, facilitating exact recovery under mild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed and sparse networks, especially with diverging numbers of communities, lack stability in existing methods for community detection, thus requiring a new approach.

Method: A non-spectral two-stage method is introduced. It involves (1) estimating the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme and (2) applying $K$-means clustering to avoid limitations of spectral methods.

Result: The method provides exact recovery of all community labels under mild sparsity and separation conditions ($γ_n \to 0$ and $K_n \to \infty$), supported by uniform row-wise concentration bounds and simulations showing superiority in sparse and directed settings.

Conclusion: The approach is novel and effective, offering reliable performance in sparse directed networks where traditional spectral methods fail, making a significant theoretical contribution to the field.

Abstract: Exact recovery in stochastic block models (SBMs) is well understood in undirected settings, but remains considerably less developed for directed and sparse networks, particularly when the number of communities diverges. Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.
  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $γ_n \to 0$ and $K_n \to \infty$.
  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first exact recovery guarantee for this class of non-spectral, neighborhood-smoothing methods in the sparse, directed setting.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stein-type Kernel Devation from Stationarity (SKDS) for learning stationary diffusions with reduced computational costs and strong theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently estimating parameters for stochastic differential equations such that their stationary distributions align with target distributions.

Method: The authors introduce a new method called Stein-type Kernel Deviation from Stationarity (SKDS), built on leveraging kernel deviation and Stein discrepancies. They analyze its theoretical properties and provide computational advantages.

Result: SKDS achieves comparable empirical accuracy to KDS, demonstrates lower computational costs, and outperforms other competitive methods in many cases.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SKDS is a practical and theoretically sound approach for learning stationary diffusions, making it a valuable alternative to existing methods like KDS.

Abstract: Learning a stationary diffusion amounts to estimating the parameters of a stochastic differential equation whose stationary distribution matches a target distribution. We build on the recently introduced kernel deviation from stationarity (KDS), which enforces stationarity by evaluating expectations of the diffusion's generator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Leveraging the connection between KDS and Stein discrepancies, we introduce the Stein-type KDS (SKDS) as an alternative formulation. We prove that a vanishing SKDS guarantees alignment of the learned diffusion's stationary distribution with the target. Furthermore, under broad parametrizations, SKDS is convex with an empirical version that is $ε$-quasiconvex with high probability. Empirically, learning with SKDS attains comparable accuracy to KDS while substantially reducing computational cost and yields improvements over the majority of competitive baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework (PEGE) and model (DDB) for improving HIV testing efficiency in data-limited settings, showing significant results on real networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to enhance HIV testing efficiency to meet UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3, addressing limitations in existing algorithmic approaches under real-world constraints.

Method: The paper proposes Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion (PEGE), a framework that embeds a generative graph expansion model into decision-making, and develops Dynamics-Driven Branching (DDB), designed for data-scarce environments with natural forest structures.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that PEGE combined with DDB achieved better outcomes, with a 13% improvement in discounted reward and 9% more HIV detections using 25% population testing, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: This research introduces effective solutions like PEGE and DDB, paving the way for scalable, data-efficient HIV testing in real-world applications.

Abstract: HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the human immune system and can lead to death without proper treatment. In collaboration with the WHO and Wits University, we study how to improve the efficiency of HIV testing with the goal of eventual deployment, directly supporting progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3. While prior work has demonstrated the promise of intelligent algorithms for sequential, network-based HIV testing, existing approaches rely on assumptions that are impractical in our real-world implementations. Here, we study sequential testing on incrementally revealed disease networks and introduce Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion (PEGE), a novel framework that directly embeds a generative distribution over graph expansions into the decision-making policy rather than attempting explicit topological reconstruction. We further propose Dynamics-Driven Branching (DDB), a diffusion-based graph expansion model that supports decision making in PEGE and is designed for data-limited settings where forest structures arise naturally, as in our real-world referral process. Experiments on real HIV transmission networks show that the combined approach (PEGE + DDB) consistently outperforms existing baselines (e.g., 13% improvement in discounted reward and 9% more HIV detections with 25% of the population tested) and explore key tradeoffs that drive decision quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inconsistency in community detection for signed networks caused by noisy or conflicting edge signs.

Method: ReCon refines community structures using an iterative framework of four steps: structural refinement, boundary refinement, contrastive learning, and clustering.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCon improves the accuracy of community detection across eighteen synthetic and four real-world networks.

Conclusion: ReCon is a reliable, model-agnostic, and effective enhancement for community detection across diverse network characteristics.

Abstract: Community detection (CD) on signed networks is crucial for understanding how positive and negative relations jointly shape network structure. However, existing CD methods often yield inconsistent communities due to noisy or conflicting edge signs. In this paper, we propose ReCon, a model-agnostic post-processing framework that progressively refines community structures through four iterative steps: (1) structural refinement, (2) boundary refinement, (3) contrastive learning, and (4) clustering. Extensive experiments on eighteen synthetic and four real-world networks using four CD methods demonstrate that ReCon consistently enhances community detection accuracy, serving as an effective and easily integrable solution for reliable CD across diverse network properties.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LCD, a generative model, and its CLIPR approach to predict transcriptomic responses from single-cell perturbations and identify underlying causal gene relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges in modeling and accurately predicting transcriptome-wide responses to cellular perturbations with existing methods which often fail to effectively disentangle biological signals from noise or provide causal insights.

Method: The authors propose the Latent Causal Diffusion (LCD), a stationary diffusion model, and its extension CLIPR, to predict gene expression changes to perturbations and identify causal gene regulatory structures under a linear drift assumption.

Result: LCD outperforms existing approaches in predicting unseen perturbation effects and learning mechanistic dynamics of gene regulation, while CLIPR uncovers causal relationships and identifies functional gene modules in complex systems.

Conclusion: The LCD-CLIPR framework successfully integrates generative modeling and causal inference to improve predictions of perturbation effects and to better understand gene regulatory networks at single-cell resolution.

Abstract: Perturbation screens hold the potential to systematically map regulatory processes at single-cell resolution, yet modeling and predicting transcriptome-wide responses to perturbations remains a major computational challenge. Existing methods often underperform simple baselines, fail to disentangle measurement noise from biological signal, and provide limited insight into the causal structure governing cellular responses. Here, we present the latent causal diffusion (LCD), a generative model that frames single-cell gene expression as a stationary diffusion process observed under measurement noise. LCD outperforms established approaches in predicting the distributional shifts of unseen perturbation combinations in single-cell RNA-sequencing screens while simultaneously learning a mechanistic dynamical system of gene regulation. To interpret these learned dynamics, we develop an approach we call causal linearization via perturbation responses (CLIPR), which yields an approximation of the direct causal effects between all genes modeled by the diffusion. CLIPR provably identifies causal effects under a linear drift assumption and recovers causal structure in both simulated systems and a genome-wide perturbation screen, where it clusters genes into coherent functional modules and resolves causal relationships that standard differential expression analysis cannot. The LCD-CLIPR framework bridges generative modeling with causal inference to predict unseen perturbation effects and map the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the transcriptome.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of determining appropriate ReLU neural network complexity for model predictive control (MPC) policies and provides explicit width and depth bounds to ensure closed-loop performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to determine network complexity for MPC policies arises due to the precision-complexity trade-off: undersized networks fail to capture MPC policies, while oversized ones negate the benefits of ReLU approximation.

Method: The authors introduce a projection-based method to enforce constraints and state-dependent Lipschitz continuity for MPC cost function, enabling robust convergence analysis. They also propose a non-uniform error framework using state-aware scaling to optimize network design.

Result: Explicit bounds for ReLU networks are derived to approximate MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance, and a state-aware framework enhances both complexity and performance.

Conclusion: The study advances ReLU NN-based MPC by offering certifiable methods to design networks with constrained complexity and enhanced performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a resurgence in using ReLU neural networks (NNs) to represent model predictive control (MPC) policies. However, determining the required network complexity to ensure closed-loop performance remains a fundamental open problem. This involves a critical precision-complexity trade-off: undersized networks may fail to capture the MPC policy, while oversized ones may outweigh the benefits of ReLU network approximation. In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. For the first time, we derive explicit bounds on ReLU network width and depth for approximating MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance. To further reduce network complexity and enhance closed-loop performance, we propose a non-uniform error framework with a state-aware scaling function to adaptively adjust both the input and output of the ReLU network. Our contributions provide a foundational step toward certifiable ReLU NN-based MPC.

*Dengzhao Fang,Jingtong Gao,Yu Li,Xiangyu Zhao,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a novel framework to enhance generative sequential recommendations by addressing tokenization noise and information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by limitations in current generative sequential recommendation frameworks, including unstable semantic tokenization and information loss due to over-reliance on coarse-grained discrete tokens.

Method: The proposed PRISM framework integrates two components: Purified Semantic Quantizer for improved tokenization and Integrated Semantic Recommender for better generation with fine-grained semantics.

Result: PRISM achieves consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in high-sparsity recommendation scenarios, tested across four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully addresses existing issues in generative sequential recommendations, showcasing its effectiveness and reliability for real-world use cases.

Abstract: Generative Sequential Recommendation (GSR) has emerged as a promising paradigm, reframing recommendation as an autoregressive sequence generation task over discrete Semantic IDs (SIDs), typically derived via codebook-based quantization. Despite its great potential in unifying retrieval and ranking, existing GSR frameworks still face two critical limitations: (1) impure and unstable semantic tokenization, where quantization methods struggle with interaction noise and codebook collapse, resulting in SIDs with ambiguous discrimination; and (2) lossy and weakly structured generation, where reliance solely on coarse-grained discrete tokens inevitably introduces information loss and neglects items' hierarchical logic. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative recommendation framework, PRISM, with Purified Representation and Integrated Semantic Modeling. Specifically, to ensure high-quality tokenization, we design a Purified Semantic Quantizer that constructs a robust codebook via adaptive collaborative denoising and hierarchical semantic anchoring mechanisms. To compensate for information loss during quantization, we further propose an Integrated Semantic Recommender, which incorporates a dynamic semantic integration mechanism to integrate fine-grained semantics and enforces logical validity through a semantic structure alignment objective. PRISM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial performance gains, particularly in high-sparsity scenarios.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores group recommender systems by introducing a framework for group counterfactual explanations, aiming to improve transparency about why certain recommendations are made.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in transparency in group recommender systems, especially in explaining how group members' preferences influence collective recommendations.

Method: The authors developed and formalized a framework for group counterfactual explanations, created utility and fairness metrics for group settings, and designed heuristic algorithms like Pareto-based filtering to improve explanation efficiency.

Result: Experiments on MovieLens and Amazon datasets demonstrated trade-offs between explanation quality and computational cost. The Pareto-filtering heuristic was notably efficient in sparse data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a way to achieve more transparent group recommendations by balancing explanation fairness, size, and computational effort, with practical benefits for sparse datasets.

Abstract: Group recommender systems help users make collective choices but often lack transparency, leaving group members uncertain about why items are suggested. Existing explanation methods focus on individuals, offering limited support for groups where multiple preferences interact. In this paper, we propose a framework for group counterfactual explanations, which reveal how removing specific past interactions would change a group recommendation. We formalize this concept, introduce utility and fairness measures tailored to groups, and design heuristic algorithms, such as Pareto-based filtering and grow-and-prune strategies, for efficient explanation discovery. Experiments on MovieLens and Amazon datasets show clear trade-offs: low-cost methods produce larger, less fair explanations, while other approaches yield concise and balanced results at higher cost. Furthermore, the Pareto-filtering heuristic demonstrates significant efficiency improvements in sparse settings.

### [227] [Orbitopal Fixing in SAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16855)
*Markus Anders,Cayden Codel,Marijn J. H. Heule*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the difficulty of integrating symmetry handling in SAT solvers and proposes a practical solution using orbitopal fixing and unit clauses, achieving faster solutions with proof compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art SAT solvers struggle with symmetry handling, causing inefficient searches and lack of integration with proof-producing requirements, which hinders their effectiveness in symmetry-rich problems.

Method: The proposed method uses orbitopal fixing from mixed-integer programming to add unit clauses and output succinct proof certificates under the substitution redundancy proof system, minimizing solver disruptions.

Result: Implemented in the satsuma tool, the approach provides consistent speedups on benchmarks with many symmetries, with minimal performance issues on other types of problems.

Conclusion: The proposed static symmetry breaking approach enhances SAT solvers’ performance in symmetrical problem instances while maintaining compatibility with proof logging systems and avoiding interference with solver heuristics.

Abstract: Despite their sophisticated heuristics, boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers are still vulnerable to symmetry, causing them to visit search regions that are symmetric to ones already explored. While symmetry handling is routine in other solving paradigms, integrating it into state-of-the-art proof-producing SAT solvers is difficult: added reasoning must be fast, non-interfering with solver heuristics, and compatible with formal proof logging. To address these issues, we present a practical static symmetry breaking approach based on orbitopal fixing, a technique adapted from mixed-integer programming. Our approach adds only unit clauses, which minimizes downstream slowdowns, and it emits succinct proof certificates in the substitution redundancy proof system. Implemented in the satsuma tool, our methods deliver consistent speedups on symmetry-rich benchmarks with negligible regressions elsewhere.

*Luke Southall,Joshua Ammermann,Rinor Kelmendi,Domenik Eichhorn,Ina Schaefer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the retargetability of quantum compilers (Tket, Qiskit, ProjectQ) on different hardware architectures and finds Tket to be the most retargetable, followed by Qiskit, with ProjectQ performing the least effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge in the NISQ-era where quantum programs face difficulty being compatible across various quantum hardware platforms due to diverse architectures. Retargetable quantum compilers are investigated to solve this issue.

Method: The authors developed and applied a metric to measure the retargetability of quantum compilers. They conducted a study on the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ, analyzing their performance in handling hardware diversity.

Result: The study found that Tket exhibited the highest level of retargetability, followed by Qiskit, while ProjectQ had the lowest retargetability.

Conclusion: The paper highlights Tket's superior retargetability, provides guidance for software developers in compiler selection, and identifies potential improvement areas for quantum compiler technologies.

Abstract: In the NISQ-era, there is a wide variety of hardware manufacturers building quantum computers. Each of these companies may choose different approaches and hardware architectures for their machines. This poses a problem for quantum software engineering, as the retargetability of quantum programs across different hardware platforms becomes a non-trivial challenge. In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software. In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed. We develop and run a study to analyze key aspects regarding the retargetability of the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ. Our findings indicate that Tket demonstrates the highest level of retargetability, closely followed by Qiskit, while ProjectQ lags behind. These results provide insights for quantum software developers in selecting appropriate compilers for their use-cases, and highlight areas for improvement in quantum compilers.

*Ryan Lopez,Charlotte Loh,Rumen Dangovski,Marin Soljačić*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper proposes using analytic LL-Bayesian Neural Networks (LL-BNNs) for active learning in photonic band gap prediction, reducing data requirements for maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more data-efficient method for predicting photonic band gaps, given the computational costs of full simulations.

Method: Using analytic LL-BNNs with uncertainty-driven sample selection to prioritize simulations in high uncertainty regions.

Result: Achieved a 2.6x reduction in training data usage compared to random sampling, while maintaining prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable modeling for photonic crystal design by efficiently focusing computational resources and offers potential applications across various scientific machine learning fields.

Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.

*Erika McPhillips,Hyeongseong Lee,Xiangyu Xie,Kathy Baylis,Chris Funk,Mengyang Gu*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: A two-phase machine learning model is developed to forecast one-year-ahead peak NDVI using climate attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of long-term forecasting methods for vegetation conditions like one-year-ahead peak NDVI.

Method: A two-phase model: phase one captures climate-NDVI relationships using generalized parallel Gaussian processes; phase two forecasts NDVI using historical climate data.

Result: The model outperformed alternative methods for gross NDVI and grid-based NDVI one-year forecasts.

Conclusion: The approach provides actionable information to farmers and ranchers for long-term agricultural planning.

Abstract: Weather conditions can drastically alter the state of crops and rangelands, and in turn, impact the incomes and food security of individuals worldwide. Satellite-based remote sensing offers an effective way to monitor vegetation and climate variables on regional and global scales. The annual peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from satellite observations, is closely associated with crop development, rangeland biomass, and vegetation growth. Although various machine learning methods have been developed to forecast NDVI over short time ranges, such as one-month-ahead predictions, long-term forecasting approaches, such as one-year-ahead predictions of vegetation conditions, are not yet available. To fill this gap, we develop a two-phase machine learning model to forecast the one-year-ahead peak NDVI over high-resolution grids, using the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States as a testbed. In phase one, we identify informative climate attributes, including precipitation and maximum vapor pressure deficit, and develop the generalized parallel Gaussian process that captures the relationship between climate attributes and NDVI. In phase two, we forecast these climate attributes using historical data at least one year before the NDVI prediction month, which then serve as inputs to forecast the peak NDVI at each spatial grid. We developed open-source tools that outperform alternative methods for both gross NDVI and grid-based NDVI one-year forecasts, providing information that can help farmers and ranchers make actionable plans a year in advance.

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: The paper discusses using differentiable programming in optimization, leveraging frameworks like PyTorch and JAX to improve convergence and solution quality through learned algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for scalable optimization methods that combine efficiency, adaptability, and improved solution quality in massive-scale problems.

Method: The approach embeds first-order optimization methods in differentiable programming frameworks, using tools like automatic differentiation and Fenchel-Rockafellar duality to adapt iterative schemes (e.g., ADMM, PDHG).

Result: End-to-end training enhances convergence rates and solution quality in applications like linear programming, optimization over power grids, regularization, and neural network verification.

Conclusion: Integrating differentiable programming into optimization methods creates a new paradigm for learning and designing adaptive algorithms with improved performance in scalable systems.

Abstract: Solving massive-scale optimization problems requires scalable first-order methods with low per-iteration cost. This tutorial highlights a shift in optimization: using differentiable programming not only to execute algorithms but to learn how to design them. Modern frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX enable this paradigm through efficient automatic differentiation. Embedding first-order methods within these systems allows end-to-end training that improves convergence and solution quality. Guided by Fenchel-Rockafellar duality, the tutorial demonstrates how duality-informed iterative schemes such as ADMM and PDHG can be learned and adapted. Case studies across LP, OPF, Laplacian regularization, and neural network verification illustrate these gains.

*Lennart Schäpermeier,Pascal Kerschke*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses flaws in multi-objective optimization benchmarking by introducing a generator for configurable and well-understood test problems, released as BONO-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issues of unrealistic properties and lack of control in current benchmarking test problems for multi-objective optimization.

Method: The paper introduces a problem generator combining convex-quadratic functions to create configurable multi-objective optimization problems, enabling control over properties like decision variables, Pareto front shapes, and local optima.

Result: The authors developed a test suite of 20 problem categories called BONO-Bench, demonstrating the generator's capabilities and showcasing its utility in benchmarking studies.

Conclusion: BONO-Bench provides a standardized and reproducible framework for generating realistic and theoretically tractable test problems, advancing benchmarking practices in multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: The evaluation of heuristic optimizers on test problems, better known as \emph{benchmarking}, is a cornerstone of research in multi-objective optimization.
  However, most test problems used in benchmarking numerical multi-objective black-box optimizers come from one of two flawed approaches: On the one hand, problems are constructed manually, which result in problems with well-understood optimal solutions, but unrealistic properties and biases.
  On the other hand, more realistic and complex single-objective problems are composited into multi-objective problems, but with a lack of control and understanding of problem properties.
  This paper proposes an extensive problem generation approach for bi-objective numerical optimization problems consisting of the combination of theoretically well-understood convex-quadratic functions into unimodal and multimodal landscapes with and without global structure.
  It supports configuration of test problem properties, such as the number of decision variables, local optima, Pareto front shape, plateaus in the objective space, or degree of conditioning, while maintaining theoretical tractability: The optimal front can be approximated to an arbitrary degree of precision regarding Pareto-compliant performance indicators such as the hypervolume or the exact R2 indicator.
  To demonstrate the generator's capabilities, a test suite of 20 problem categories, called \emph{BONO-Bench}, is created and subsequently used as a basis of an illustrative benchmark study.
  Finally, the general approach underlying our proposed generator, together with the associated test suite, is publicly released in the Python package \texttt{bonobench} to facilitate reproducible benchmarking.

### [233] [ES4R: Speech Encoding Based on Prepositive Affective Modeling for Empathetic Response Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16225)
*Zhuoyue Gao,Xiaohui Wang,Xiaocui Yang,Wen Zhang,Daling Wang,Shi Feng,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes ES4R, a framework for speech-based empathetic response generation that enhances affective understanding in multi-turn dialogues using structured affective context and dual-level attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aiming to improve empathetic dialogue systems, the authors address the challenges in maintaining affective coherence and contextual understanding in speech-based systems.

Method: The authors introduce ES4R, employing structured affective context modeling, a dual-level attention mechanism, speech-guided cross-modal attention, and energy-based strategies for empathetic output synthesis.

Result: ES4R surpasses existing models in both automated evaluations and human assessments of empathetic response quality.

Conclusion: Effective modeling of affective context significantly enhances empathetic dialogue capabilities in speech-based systems, and ES4R demonstrates robustness across different language model backbones.

Abstract: Empathetic speech dialogue requires not only understanding linguistic content but also perceiving rich paralinguistic information such as prosody, tone, and emotional intensity for affective understandings. Existing speech-to-speech large language models either rely on ASR transcription or use encoders to extract latent representations, often weakening affective information and contextual coherence in multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we propose \textbf{ES4R}, a framework for speech-based empathetic response generation. Our core innovation lies in explicitly modeling structured affective context before speech encoding, rather than relying on implicit learning by the encoder or explicit emotion supervision. Specifically, we introduce a dual-level attention mechanism to capture turn-level affective states and dialogue-level affective dynamics. The resulting affective representations are then integrated with textual semantics through speech-guided cross-modal attention to generate empathetic responses. For speech output, we employ energy-based strategy selection and style fusion to achieve empathetic speech synthesis. ES4R consistently outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and human evaluations and remains robust across different LLM backbones.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reliable automated scoring for L2 English pronunciation to provide personalized feedback and fair assessment.

Method: It evaluates Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct’s rubric-aligned scoring on 5,000 utterances from the Speechocean762 dataset for accuracy, fluency, prosody, and completeness.

Result: The model demonstrates agreement with human ratings within +-2 tolerance, especially for high-quality speech, but has limitations with low-quality speech and error detection.

Conclusion: Speech LLMs show potential in scalable pronunciation assessment, suggesting improvements through better prompting, calibration, and phonetic integration.

Abstract: An accurate assessment of L2 English pronunciation is crucial for language learning, as it provides personalized feedback and ensures a fair evaluation of individual progress. However, automated scoring remains challenging due to the complexity of sentence-level fluency, prosody, and completeness. This paper evaluates the zero-shot performance of Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, an instruction-tuned speech-LLM, on 5,000 Speechocean762 utterances. The model generates rubric-aligned scores for accuracy, fluency, prosody, and completeness, showing strong agreement with human ratings within +-2 tolerance, especially for high-quality speech. However, it tends to overpredict low-quality speech scores and lacks precision in error detection. These findings demonstrate the strong potential of speech LLMs in scalable pronunciation assessment and suggest future improvements through enhanced prompting, calibration, and phonetic integration to advance Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training.

### [235] [Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16240)
*Jiaheng Dong,Hong Jia,Ting Dang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 11 test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) under domain shifts and finds backpropagation-free methods most promising while others, like entropy minimization, fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SER systems face challenges from domain shifts like speaker variability and differences in emotion datasets, but current solutions rely on source or labeled target data, raising privacy and availability concerns.

Method: The study systematically evaluates 11 TTA methods specifically for SER tasks using only unlabeled target data, examining their ability to adapt during inference.

Result: Backpropagation-free methods perform well, while approaches like entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling fail due to SER’s inherent emotional ambiguity and differing task demands.

Conclusion: No universal TTA method exists for SER; effectiveness depends on specific domain shifts and tasks, highlighting the need for task-specific adaptation solutions.

Abstract: The practical utility of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems is undermined by their fragility to domain shifts, such as speaker variability, the distinction between acted and naturalistic emotions, and cross-corpus variations. While domain adaptation and fine-tuning are widely studied, they require either source data or labelled target data, which are often unavailable or raise privacy concerns in SER. Test-time adaptation (TTA) bridges this gap by adapting models at inference using only unlabeled target data. Yet, having been predominantly designed for image classification and speech recognition, the efficacy of TTA for mitigating the unique domain shifts in SER has not been investigated. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation and comparison covering 11 TTA methods across three representative SER tasks. The results indicate that backpropagation-free TTA methods are the most promising. Conversely, entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling generally fail, as their core assumption of a single, confident ground-truth label is incompatible with the inherent ambiguity of emotional expression. Further, no single method universally excels, and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the distributional shifts and tasks.

Motivation: To design a more accurate and efficient keyword spotting model for edge devices, addressing the limitations of current methods.

Method: EdgeSpot integrates an optimized BC-ResNet backbone with trainable PCEN frontend, lightweight temporal self-attention, and knowledge distillation using a self-supervised teacher model with Sub-center ArcFace loss.

Result: EdgeSpot-4 enhances 10-shot accuracy at 1% FAR from 73.7% to 82.0% with only 29.4M MACs and 128k parameters.

Conclusion: EdgeSpot achieves superior accuracy-to-efficiency balance, making it effective for keyword spotting on edge devices.

Abstract: We introduce an efficient few-shot keyword spotting model for edge devices, EdgeSpot, that pairs an optimized version of a BC-ResNet-based acoustic backbone with a trainable Per-Channel Energy Normalization frontend and lightweight temporal self-attention. Knowledge distillation is utilized during training by employing a self-supervised teacher model, optimized with Sub-center ArcFace loss. This study demonstrates that the EdgeSpot model consistently provides better accuracy at a fixed false-alarm rate (FAR) than strong BC-ResNet baselines. The largest variant, EdgeSpot-4, improves the 10-shot accuracy at 1% FAR from 73.7% to 82.0%, which requires only 29.4M MACs with 128k parameters.

TL;DR: The paper addresses Single Domain Generalization (SDG) in medical imaging applications, focusing on deploying models that generalize across unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variability due to domain shifts in medical imaging, caused by differences in acquisition protocols and scanners, poses challenges for effective AI deployment.

Method: The paper proposes DL+EKE, a deep learning method integrated with expert knowledge, and validates it on diabetic retinopathy and other medical imaging applications.

Result: DL+EKE outperforms state-of-the-art SDG approaches in diabetic retinopathy and shows real-world applicability in seizure detection using fMRI and coronary artery detection using stress ECG.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert knowledge into deep learning models enhances SDG, enabling better generalization in diverse medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: A desirable property of any deployed artificial intelligence is generalization across domains, i.e. data generation distribution under a specific acquisition condition. In medical imagining applications the most coveted property for effective deployment is Single Domain Generalization (SDG), which addresses the challenge of training a model on a single domain to ensure it generalizes well to unseen target domains. In multi-center studies, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare class characteristics. This paper presents our experience on SDG in real life deployment for two exemplary medical imaging case studies on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, and stress electrocardiogram based coronary artery detection. Utilizing the commonly used application of diabetic retinopathy, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art SDG techniques fail to achieve generalized performance across data domains. We then develop a generic expert knowledge integrated deep learning technique DL+EKE and instantiate it for the DR application and show that DL+EKE outperforms SOTA SDG methods on DR. We then deploy instances of DL+EKE technique on the two real world examples of stress ECG and resting state (rs)-fMRI and discuss issues faced with SDG techniques.

Motivation: Evaluate how foundational models perform in medical segmentation amidst real-world imprecisions in visual prompts.

Result: Identified dependencies on visual shape and spatial cues, and varying resilience towards specific prompt perturbations in foundational models.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for robust adaptations of foundational models for realistic medical segmentation scenarios with imprecise prompts.

Abstract: While 3D foundational models have shown promise for promptable segmentation of medical volumes, their robustness to imprecise prompts remains under-explored. In this work, we aim to address this gap by systematically studying the effect of various controlled perturbations of dense visual prompts, that closely mimic real-world imprecision. By conducting experiments with two recent foundational models on a multi-organ abdominal segmentation task, we reveal several facets of promptable medical segmentation, especially pertaining to reliance on visual shape and spatial cues, and the extent of resilience of models towards certain perturbations.

TL;DR: PanopMamba introduces a hybrid architecture combining Mamba, Transformer, and state-space modeling to improve nuclei panoptic segmentation in histopathology images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cancer diagnostics by addressing challenges in nuclei panoptic segmentation, including small object detection, ambiguous boundaries, and class imbalance.

Method: A multiscale Mamba backbone and State Space Model (SSM)-based feature fusion network are used within a hybrid encoder-decoder framework for improved feature representation and long-range perception.

Result: PanopMamba achieves superior performance in nuclei segmentation on benchmark datasets MoNuSAC2020 and NuInsSeg with enhanced metrics for evaluation.

Conclusion: PanopMamba improves nuclei panoptic segmentation and introduces novel evaluation metrics, validating its robustness and distinctiveness.

Abstract: Nuclei panoptic segmentation supports cancer diagnostics by integrating both semantic and instance segmentation of different cell types to analyze overall tissue structure and individual nuclei in histopathology images. Major challenges include detecting small objects, handling ambiguous boundaries, and addressing class imbalance. To address these issues, we propose PanopMamba, a novel hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer with additional feature-enhanced fusion via state space modeling. We design a multiscale Mamba backbone and a State Space Model (SSM)-based fusion network to enable efficient long-range perception in pyramid features, thereby extending the pure encoder-decoder framework while facilitating information sharing across multiscale features of nuclei. The proposed SSM-based feature-enhanced fusion integrates pyramid feature networks and dynamic feature enhancement across different spatial scales, enhancing the feature representation of densely overlapping nuclei in both semantic and spatial dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Mamba-based approach for panoptic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce alternative evaluation metrics, including image-level Panoptic Quality ($i$PQ), boundary-weighted PQ ($w$PQ), and frequency-weighted PQ ($fw$PQ), which are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of nuclei segmentation and thereby mitigate the potential bias inherent in vanilla PQ. Experimental evaluations on two multiclass nuclei segmentation benchmark datasets, MoNuSAC2020 and NuInsSeg, demonstrate the superiority of PanopMamba for nuclei panoptic segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, the robustness of PanopMamba is validated across various metrics, while the distinctiveness of PQ variants is also demonstrated.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowMapSR, a new framework for diffusion-based image super-resolution that balances reconstruction accuracy and photorealism with efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving fast inference and balancing reconstruction accuracy and photorealism in diffusion-based image super-resolution.

Method: FlowMapSR leverages Flow Map models for super-resolution, enhanced by positive-negative prompting guidance and adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: FlowMapSR achieves better reconstruction-photorealism trade-off and competitive inference time for x4 and x8 upscaling tasks using a single model.

Conclusion: FlowMapSR demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches and provides scalable solutions for image super-resolution without scale-specific adjustments.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) has recently attracted significant attention by leveraging the expressive power of large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models (DMs). A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PocketDVDNet, a lightweight video denoising model created through a compression framework that ensures efficiency and high-quality output under real-world noise challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the difficulty of real-time video denoising due to multi-component sensor noise, especially for tasks like autofocus, autonomous driving, and surveillance.

Method: PocketDVDNet employs sparsity-guided structured pruning, a physics-informed noise model, and knowledge distillation. This is done by starting with a reference model, applying pruning, and training a student network without explicit noise maps.

Result: PocketDVDNet reduces model size by 74%, enhances denoising quality, and performs real-time processing for 5-frame patches.

Conclusion: Aggressive model compression and domain-specific knowledge distillation can effectively balance performance and efficiency for realistic use in real-time video denoising scenarios.

Abstract: Live video denoising under realistic, multi-component sensor noise remains challenging for applications such as autofocus, autonomous driving, and surveillance. We propose PocketDVDNet, a lightweight video denoiser developed using our model compression framework that combines sparsity-guided structured pruning, a physics-informed noise model, and knowledge distillation to achieve high-quality restoration with reduced resource demands. Starting from a reference model, we induce sparsity, apply targeted channel pruning, and retrain a teacher on realistic multi-component noise. The student network learns implicit noise handling, eliminating the need for explicit noise-map inputs. PocketDVDNet reduces the original model size by 74% while improving denoising quality and processing 5-frame patches in real-time. These results demonstrate that aggressive compression, combined with domain-adapted distillation, can reconcile performance and efficiency for practical, real-time video denoising.

Abstract: The study of \textit{regret minimization in fixed-price bilateral trade} has received considerable attention in recent research. Previous works [CCC+24a, CCC+24b, AFF24, BCCF24, CJLZ25, LCM25a, GDFS25] have acquired a thorough understanding of the problem, except for determining the tight regret bound for GBB semi-feedback fixed-price mechanisms under adversarial values.
  In this paper, we resolve this open question by devising an $\widetilde{O}(T^{2 / 3})$-regret mechanism, matching the $Ω(T^{2 / 3})$ lower bound from [CJLZ25] up to polylogarithmic factors.

### [243] [Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Collective Action and Loyalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16237)
*Vik Pant,Eric Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper extends computational models for analyzing team dynamics in mixed-motive settings, introducing loyalty-moderated mechanisms to mitigate free-riding. The framework applies to human and multi-agent systems with consistent experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent issue of free-riding in mixed-motive team settings and improve understanding of collective action problems through computational models.

Method: Introduces loyalty-moderated utility functions with mechanisms like welfare internalization, intrinsic contribution satisfaction, and cost tolerance. Experimental validation using 3,125 configurations and case study data from Apache HTTP Server.

Result: Validation confirms robust loyalty effects, achieving six behavioral targets and reproducing contribution patterns across team lifecycle phases. Experimental data demonstrate effort differentiation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully connects member incentives to team-level dynamics, mitigating free-riding and achieving significant impact, validated both experimentally and empirically.

Abstract: Mixed-motive multi-agent settings are rife with persistent free-riding because individual effort benefits all members equally, yet each member bears the full cost of their own contribution. Classical work by Holmström established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases. Statistical significance confirmed at p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.71.

### [244] [White-Box Sensitivity Auditing with Steering Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16398)
*Hannah Cyberey,Yangfeng Ji,David Evans*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a white-box sensitivity auditing framework for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate bias more effectively by leveraging internal model mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box evaluations of LLMs, which rely on input-output testing, fail to sufficiently measure complex and socially relevant properties like bias, particularly due to their abstract nature and heuristic limitations.

Method: The authors propose a white-box sensitivity auditing framework that uses activation steering to perform internal sensitivity tests within LLMs. It manipulates critical concepts central to the model’s function to assess dependence on sensitive attributes.

Result: The proposed method successfully uncovers significant reliance on protected attributes in LLM predictions across various high-stakes tasks, even when traditional black-box evaluations find little to no bias.

Conclusion: The white-box sensitivity auditing framework provides a more robust and detailed assessment of LLM biases compared to standard black-box methodologies, enhancing its potential for addressing socially relevant issues in AI systems.

Abstract: Algorithmic audits are essential tools for examining systems for properties required by regulators or desired by operators. Current audits of large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on black-box evaluations that assess model behavior only through input-output testing. These methods are limited to tests constructed in the input space, often generated by heuristics. In addition, many socially relevant model properties (e.g., gender bias) are abstract and difficult to measure through text-based inputs alone. To address these limitations, we propose a white-box sensitivity auditing framework for LLMs that leverages activation steering to conduct more rigorous assessments through model internals. Our auditing method conducts internal sensitivity tests by manipulating key concepts relevant to the model's intended function for the task. We demonstrate its application to bias audits in four simulated high-stakes LLM decision tasks. Our method consistently reveals substantial dependence on protected attributes in model predictions, even in settings where standard black-box evaluations suggest little or no bias.

*Shashank Prakash,Ranjitha Prasad,Avinash Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nishpaksh, a fairness evaluation tool tailored for Indian regulatory standards, addressing gaps in global AI fairness frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a fair and transparent AI evaluation framework tailored to India's regulatory and infrastructure-specific needs, particularly in telecom and 6G applications.

Method: Nishpaksh combines survey-based risk assessment, contextual thresholds, and quantitative fairness evaluation in a web-based tool, adhering to the TEC framework.

Result: Experimental validation on the COMPAS dataset shows Nishpaksh effectively identifies biases and provides compliance-ready fairness scores.

Conclusion: Nishpaksh bridges research and regulatory requirements, fostering responsible AI deployment in critical infrastructure.

Abstract: The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in high-stakes decision-making systems, particularly within emerging telecom and 6G applications, underscores the urgent need for transparent and standardized fairness assessment frameworks. While global toolkits such as IBM AI Fairness 360 and Microsoft Fairlearn have advanced bias detection, they often lack alignment with region-specific regulatory requirements and national priorities. To address this gap, we propose Nishpaksh, an indigenous fairness evaluation tool that operationalizes the Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) Standard for the Evaluation and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems. Nishpaksh integrates survey-based risk quantification, contextual threshold determination, and quantitative fairness evaluation into a unified, web-based dashboard. The tool employs vectorized computation, reactive state management, and certification-ready reporting to enable reproducible, audit-grade assessments, thereby addressing a critical post-standardization implementation need. Experimental validation on the COMPAS dataset demonstrates Nishpaksh's effectiveness in identifying attribute-specific bias and generating standardized fairness scores compliant with the TEC framework. The system bridges the gap between research-oriented fairness methodologies and regulatory AI governance in India, marking a significant step toward responsible and auditable AI deployment within critical infrastructure like telecommunications.

### [246] [A Novel Transfer Learning Approach for Mental Stability Classification from Voice Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16793)
*Rafiul Islam,Md. Taimur Ahad*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study introduces a transfer learning and data augmentation approach for mental stability classification from human voice signals using CNNs, achieving high accuracy and AUC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in mental stability classification and improve CNN performance for analyzing voice spectrograms.

Method: The study used VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121 CNN architectures applied to spectrograms with three strategies: non-augmented data, augmented data, and transfer learning.

Result: DenseNet121 achieved the best performance with 94% accuracy and 99% AUC using transfer learning and data augmentation.

Conclusion: Combining data augmentation and transfer learning effectively enhances CNN-based classification, providing a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool for mental health.

Abstract: This study presents a novel transfer learning approach and data augmentation technique for mental stability classification using human voice signals and addresses the challenges associated with limited data availability. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to analyse spectrogram images generated from voice recordings. Three CNN architectures, VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, were evaluated across three experimental phases: training on non-augmented data, augmented data, and transfer learning. This proposed transfer learning approach involves pre-training models on the augmented dataset and fine-tuning them on the non-augmented dataset while ensuring strict data separation to prevent data leakage. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance compared to the baseline approach. Among three CNN architectures, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy of 94% and an AUC score of 99% using the proposed transfer learning approach. This finding highlights the effectiveness of combining data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance CNN-based classification of mental stability using voice spectrograms, offering a promising non-invasive tool for mental health diagnostics.

### [247] [SoundBreak: A Systematic Study of Audio-Only Adversarial Attacks on Trimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16231)
*Aafiya Hussain,Gaurav Srivastava,Alvi Ishmam,Zaber Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper studies audio-only adversarial attacks on multimodal models combining audio, vision, and language, showing high attack success rates and exposing vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of multimodal models, specifically their susceptibility to untargeted, audio-only adversarial attacks.

Method: Six attack objectives were analyzed across trimodal models targeting different stages like audio encoder, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and outputs.

Result: Audio-only perturbations succeeded in up to 96% of attacks under low distortion levels across multiple models, while transferability issues were noted.

Conclusion: Current multimodal systems are vulnerable to single-modality attacks, calling for defenses that ensure cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models that integrate audio, vision, and language achieve strong performance on reasoning and generation tasks, yet their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains poorly understood. We study a realistic and underexplored threat model: untargeted, audio-only adversarial attacks on trimodal audio-video-language models. We analyze six complementary attack objectives that target different stages of multimodal processing, including audio encoder representations, cross-modal attention, hidden states, and output likelihoods. Across three state-of-the-art models and multiple benchmarks, we show that audio-only perturbations can induce severe multimodal failures, achieving up to 96% attack success rate. We further show that attacks can be successful at low perceptual distortions (LPIPS <= 0.08, SI-SNR >= 0) and benefit more from extended optimization than increased data scale. Transferability across models and encoders remains limited, while speech recognition systems such as Whisper primarily respond to perturbation magnitude, achieving >97% attack success under severe distortion. These results expose a previously overlooked single-modality attack surface in multimodal systems and motivate defenses that enforce cross-modal consistency.

*Haoyun Yang,Xin Xiao,Jiang Zhong,Yu Tian,Dong Xiaohua,Yu Mao,Hao Wu,Kaiwen Wei*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study investigates how Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) align with human neural dynamics during natural listening using EEG data and various similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Audio LLMs' internal representations align with human neural responses when processing naturalistic audio, filling a knowledge gap regarding their neurobiological relevance.

Method: The authors analyzed layer-wise representational alignment between 12 Audio LLMs and EEG data using 8 similarity metrics, including Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), across two datasets.

Result: The paper found (1) varying alignment ranking across metrics, (2) spatio-temporal alignment peaks linked to the N400 time window, and (3) a unique affective dissociation pattern with negative prosody.

Conclusion: The findings provide neurobiological insights into the mechanisms underlying Audio LLMs, showing their partial alignment with human cognitive dynamics during audio processing.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.

### [249] [CORD: Bridging the Audio-Text Reasoning Gap via Weighted On-policy Cross-modal Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16547)
*Jing Hu,Danxiang Zhu,Xianlong Luo,Dan Zhang,Shuwei He,Yishu Lei,Haitao Zheng,Shikun Feng,Jingzhou He,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses the performance gaps in large audio language models (LALMs) through CORD, a cross-modal alignment framework that leverages text-conditioned reasoning as an internal teacher using multi-granularity alignment, significantly improving audio-text reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of LALMs is hindered by their inability to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap, leading to degraded knowledge and reasoning compared to their text-based counterparts.

Method: Proposes CORD, a cross-modal self-distillation framework that uses text as an internal teacher. It applies token-level KL divergence with priority weighting and sequence-level optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: CORD enhances the reasoning capability of LALMs, substantially reduces the performance gap between audio-text modalities, and demonstrates high data efficiency using only 80k synthetic training samples.

Conclusion: The proposed CORD framework effectively improves audio-conditioned reasoning by aligning audio with text at multiple levels, validating its efficiency and significance in bridging the audio-text gap while remaining data-efficient.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have garnered significant research interest. Despite being built upon text-based large language models (LLMs), LALMs frequently exhibit a degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation stems from the failure of current training paradigms to effectively bridge the acoustic-semantic gap within the feature representation space. To address this challenge, we propose CORD, a unified alignment framework that performs online cross-modal self-distillation. Specifically, it aligns audio-conditioned reasoning with its text-conditioned counterpart within a unified model. Leveraging the text modality as an internal teacher, CORD performs multi-granularity alignment throughout the audio rollout process. At the token level, it employs on-policy reverse KL divergence with importance-aware weighting to prioritize early and semantically critical tokens. At the sequence level, CORD introduces a judge-based global reward to optimize complete reasoning trajectories via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CORD consistently enhances audio-conditioned reasoning and substantially bridges the audio-text performance gap with only 80k synthetic training samples, validating the efficacy and data efficiency of our on-policy, multi-level cross-modal alignment approach.

*David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Audio classifiers rely heavily on spurious, non-musical features. This paper introduces a causal reasoning method via FreqReX to identify essential features and demonstrates subtle manipulations of classifiers with significant impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio classifiers are prone to misclassifications due to reliance on spurious features and correlations. The motivation is to better understand the set of features that influence audio classifier decisions.

Method: The paper presents a causal reasoning method implemented in FreqReX to discover causally sufficient and necessary frequency subsets for audio classification.

Result: Experiments reveal that manipulating one out of 240,000 frequencies can alter classification 58% of the time, with the changes being nearly inaudible.

Conclusion: Causal analysis provides deep insights into audio classifier reasoning and enables precise manipulations of their outputs.

Abstract: It is well-known that audio classifiers often rely on non-musically relevant features and spurious correlations to classify audio. Hence audio classifiers are easy to manipulate or confuse, resulting in wrong classifications. While inducing a misclassification is not hard, until now the set of features that the classifiers rely on was not well understood.
  In this paper we introduce a new method that uses causal reasoning to discover features of the frequency space that are sufficient and necessary for a given classification. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the tool FreqReX and provide experimental results on a number of standard benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that causally sufficient and necessary subsets allow us to manipulate the outputs of the models in a variety of ways by changing the input very slightly. Namely, a change to one out of 240,000 frequencies results in a change in classification 58% of the time, and the change can be so small that it is practically inaudible. These results show that causal analysis is useful for understanding the reasoning process of audio classifiers and can be used to successfully manipulate their outputs.

*Kai Li,Jiahao Lu,Fu Yao,Guang Zeng,Dongsheng Liu,Shengfei Gu,Zhengpeng Zhao,Jiachen Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-performance crypto-processor addressing latency and resource usage issues in FrodoKEM hardware, achieving superior efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FrodoKEM's robust security profile faces practical limitations due to high latency and heavy resource demands in hardware implementations, which this paper aims to overcome.

Method: A crypto-processor with a multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme, a reconfigurable parallel multiplier array, and a compact memory scheduling strategy was developed.

Result: The processor significantly enhanced both efficiency and hardware performance for FrodoKEM implementations, reducing the area-time product by 1.75-2.00 times on an Artix-7 FPGA.

Conclusion: The proposed design resolves practical challenges in FrodoKEM hardware, achieving the fastest execution time, reduced hardware resource usage, and comprehensive functionality for all security levels.

Abstract: FrodoKEM is a lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). It has been considered for standardization by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) due to its robust security profile. However, its hardware implementation exhibits a weakness of high latency and heavy resource burden, hindering its practical application. Moreover, diverse usage scenarios call for comprehensive functionality. To address these challenges, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient crypto-processor for FrodoKEM. A multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme is introduced to enable efficient multi-module scheduling and minimize operational latency. Furthermore, a high-speed, reconfigurable parallel multiplier array is integrated to handle intensive matrix computations under diverse computation patterns, significantly enhancing hardware efficiency. In addition, a compact memory scheduling strategy shortens the lifespan of intermediate matrices, thereby reducing overall storage requirements. The proposed design provides full support for all FrodoKEM security levels and protocol phases. It consumes 13467 LUTs, 6042 FFs, and 14 BRAMs on an Artix-7 FPGA and achieves the fastest reported execution time. Compared with state-of-the-art hardware implementations, our design improves the area-time product (ATP) by 1.75-2.00 times.

*Wenbo Guo,Chengwei Liu,Ming Kang,Yiran Zhang,Jiahui Wu,Zhengzi Xu,Vinay Sachidananda,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PyGuard, a detection framework, enhances the accuracy of identifying malicious packages in PyPI with semantic understanding, achieving 99.50% accuracy and drastically reducing false positives compared to existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection tools for malicious packages in PyPI have high false positive rates due to reliance on simple syntactic rules, failing to differentiate between similar-looking legitimate and malicious code.

Method: PyGuard utilizes hierarchical pattern mining, semantic abstractions through Large Language Models, and integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning for improved detection accuracy.

Result: PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy, significantly lowers false positives, supports obfuscated code detection with 98.28% accuracy, identifies 219 previously unknown malicious PyPI packages, and proves cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages.

Conclusion: Semantic and knowledge-driven approaches like PyGuard substantially improve malicious package detection, ensuring better security with minimal false positives while enabling cross-language knowledge transfer.

Abstract: The Python Package Index (PyPI) has become a target for malicious actors, yet existing detection tools generate false positive rates of 15-30%, incorrectly flagging one-third of legitimate packages as malicious. This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.

*Xing Su,Hao Wu,Hanzhong Liang,Yunlin Jiang,Yuxi Cheng,Yating Liu,Fengyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces TracExp, an automated framework for creating proofs-of-concept (PoCs) for on-chain attacks using transaction traces and large language models, achieving high success and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducing on-chain attacks is challenging as it requires substantial expertise and manual effort while current methods are labor-intensive and inefficient.

Method: TracExp uses trace-driven reverse engineering and large language models to analyze low-level transaction traces, extract attacker logic, and generate semantically enriched exploit pseudocode for synthesizing PoCs.

Result: TracExp achieved a success rate of 93% in synthesizing PoCs across 321 real-world incidents within the last 20 months, with an average cost of $0.07 per case and 58.78% directly verifiable.

Conclusion: TracExp demonstrates high effectiveness, significantly reducing labor and expertise required for on-chain attack reproduction, while also contributing valuable insights and PoCs to the blockchain security community.

Abstract: Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact.

### [254] [A New Paradigm for Trusted Respiratory Monitoring Via Consumer Electronics-grade Radar Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16241)
*Xinyu Li,Jinyang Huang,Feng-Qi Cui,Meng Wang,Peng Zhao,Meng Li,Dan Guo,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tru-RM, a radar-based respiratory monitoring system that ensures high accuracy while anonymizing user-sensitive identity information (USI) to prevent privacy leaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the privacy concerns in non-contact radar-based respiratory monitoring by securely anonymizing user identity information without compromising monitoring accuracy.

Method: A novel Trusted Respiratory Monitoring paradigm (Tru-RM) is proposed, which includes the techniques of Attribute Feature Decoupling (AFD) for signal decomposition, Flexible Perturbation Encryptor (FPE) for user identity encryption, and Perturbation Tolerable Network (PTN) for accurate monitoring despite waveform perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tru-RM ensures strong anonymity for USI and achieves high accuracy in detecting perturbed respiratory waveforms under various conditions, such as different distances, respiratory patterns, and durations.

Conclusion: Tru-RM successfully balances anonymity and accuracy in radar-based respiratory monitoring, offering a promising solution for privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring systems.

Abstract: Respiratory monitoring is an extremely important task in modern medical services. Due to its significant advantages, e.g., non-contact, radar-based respiratory monitoring has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. Unfortunately, though it can achieve high monitoring accuracy, consumer electronics-grade radar data inevitably contains User-sensitive Identity Information (USI), which may be maliciously used and further lead to privacy leakage. To track these challenges, by variational mode decomposition (VMD) and adversarial loss-based encryption, we propose a novel Trusted Respiratory Monitoring paradigm, Tru-RM, to perform automated respiratory monitoring through radio signals while effectively anonymizing USI. The key enablers of Tru-RM are Attribute Feature Decoupling (AFD), Flexible Perturbation Encryptor (FPE), and robust Perturbation Tolerable Network (PTN) used for attribute decomposition, identity encryption, and perturbed respiratory monitoring, respectively. Specifically, AFD is designed to decompose the raw radar signals into the universal respiratory component, the personal difference component, and other unrelated components. Then, by using large noise to drown out the other unrelated components, and the phase noise algorithm with a learning intensity parameter to eliminate USI in the personal difference component, FPE is designed to achieve complete user identity information encryption without affecting respiratory features. Finally, by designing the transferred generalized domain-independent network, PTN is employed to accurately detect respiration when waveforms change significantly. Extensive experiments based on various detection distances, respiratory patterns, and durations demonstrate the superior performance of Tru-RM on strong anonymity of USI, and high detection accuracy of perturbed respiratory waveforms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOIR, a framework for secure use of LLM-powered code generation by protecting user prompts and generated code from the cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to address issues of intellectual property and data security risks posed by LLM-powered code generation, particularly in environments where the cloud service can access sensitive user inputs and outputs.

Method: NOIR employs a client-side encoder and decoder to encode prompts and decode enriched embeddings from the cloud. It further incorporates a mechanism for local differential privacy and a randomized tokenizer to safeguard against data reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by the cloud.

Result: NOIR achieves significant performance improvements over existing baselines while maintaining strong privacy protections. Testing on benchmarks such as Evalplus and BigCodeBench indicates competitive performance with minimal drops in accuracy despite strong privacy measures.

Conclusion: NOIR effectively mitigates security and privacy concerns in cloud-based code generation while maintaining high performance levels, setting a new standard for handling proprietary data in LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: Although boosting software development performance, large language model (LLM)-powered code generation introduces intellectual property and data security risks rooted in the fact that a service provider (cloud) observes a client's prompts and generated code, which can be proprietary in commercial systems. To mitigate this problem, we propose NOIR, the first framework to protect the client's prompts and generated code from the cloud. NOIR uses an encoder and a decoder at the client to encode and send the prompts' embeddings to the cloud to get enriched embeddings from the LLM, which are then decoded to generate the code locally at the client. Since the cloud can use the embeddings to infer the prompt and the generated code, NOIR introduces a new mechanism to achieve indistinguishability, a local differential privacy protection at the token embedding level, in the vocabulary used in the prompts and code, and a data-independent and randomized tokenizer on the client side. These components effectively defend against reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by an honest-but-curious cloud. Extensive analysis and results using open-source LLMs show that NOIR significantly outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks, including the Evalplus (MBPP and HumanEval, Pass@1 of 76.7 and 77.4), and BigCodeBench (Pass@1 of 38.7, only a 1.77% drop from the original LLM) under strong privacy against attacks.

### [256] [DeMark: A Query-Free Black-Box Attack on Deepfake Watermarking Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16473)
*Wei Song,Zhenchang Xing,Liming Zhu,Yulei Sui,Jingling Xue*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeMark, a black-box attack framework targeting defensive watermarks in deepfakes, demonstrating their vulnerability to removal while urging the need for robust watermarking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The creation and misuse of realistic deepfakes necessitate reliable watermarking techniques for detection and provenance tracking. This research challenges the assumption that such watermarks are inherently resistant to removal.

Method: The proposed method, DeMark, is a query-free black-box attack that leverages compressive sensing and latent-space sparsification to suppress watermarks in encoder-decoder models while preserving image realism.

Result: DeMark reduces watermark detection accuracy from 100% to an average of 32.9% across eight watermarking schemes while maintaining high visual quality, outperforming existing attacks. Defense strategies like super resolution and adversarial training prove largely ineffective.

Conclusion: Encoder-decoder watermarking schemes remain vulnerable to latent-space exploitation by methods like DeMark, highlighting the need for designing stronger watermarking techniques to secure synthetic media against manipulation.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of realistic deepfakes has raised urgent concerns over their misuse, motivating the use of defensive watermarks in synthetic images for reliable detection and provenance tracking. However, this defense paradigm assumes such watermarks are inherently resistant to removal. We challenge this assumption with DeMark, a query-free black-box attack framework that targets defensive image watermarking schemes for deepfakes. DeMark exploits latent-space vulnerabilities in encoder-decoder watermarking models through a compressive sensing based sparsification process, suppressing watermark signals while preserving perceptual and structural realism appropriate for deepfakes. Across eight state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, DeMark reduces watermark detection accuracy from 100% to 32.9% on average while maintaining natural visual quality, outperforming existing attacks. We further evaluate three defense strategies, including image super resolution, sparse watermarking, and adversarial training, and find them largely ineffective. These results demonstrate that current encoder decoder watermarking schemes remain vulnerable to latent-space manipulations, underscoring the need for more robust watermarking methods to safeguard against deepfakes.

*Xianya Fang,Xianying Luo,Yadong Wang,Xiang Chen,Yu Tian,Zequn Sun,Rui Liu,Jun Fang,Naiqiang Tan,Yuanning Cui,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SafeThinker, a model that enhances safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically routing input based on risk and reducing vulnerability to attacks without utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of shallow safety alignment in LLMs that leaves them vulnerable to disguised attacks while also degrading their utility.

Method: The proposed SafeThinker framework uses a lightweight gateway classifier for risk assessment and routes inputs through: (i) Standardized Refusal Mechanism for explicit threats, (ii) Safety-Aware Twin Expert (SATE) for deceptive queries, and (iii) Distribution-Guided Think (DDGT) for uncertain situations.

Result: SafeThinker achieves reduced attack success rates across different jailbreak strategies while maintaining the utility of the LLM.

Conclusion: By integrating dynamic defensive mechanisms and coordinating intrinsic judgment throughout text generation, SafeThinker balances robustness against attacks with practicality in usage.

Abstract: Despite the intrinsic risk-awareness of Large Language Models (LLMs), current defenses often result in shallow safety alignment, rendering models vulnerable to disguised attacks (e.g., prefilling) while degrading utility. To bridge this gap, we propose SafeThinker, an adaptive framework that dynamically allocates defensive resources via a lightweight gateway classifier. Based on the gateway's risk assessment, inputs are routed through three distinct mechanisms: (i) a Standardized Refusal Mechanism for explicit threats to maximize efficiency; (ii) a Safety-Aware Twin Expert (SATE) module to intercept deceptive attacks masquerading as benign queries; and (iii) a Distribution-Guided Think (DDGT) component that adaptively intervenes during uncertain generation. Experiments show that SafeThinker significantly lowers attack success rates across diverse jailbreak strategies without compromising utility, demonstrating that coordinating intrinsic judgment throughout the generation process effectively balances robustness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The drive behind this paper is to address the mounting security challenges posed by the adoption of neuromorphic computing technologies, which aim for energy efficiency and brain-inspired functions.

Method: The study conducts a systematic review of threats, vulnerabilities (e.g., side-channel attacks), and countermeasures in neuromorphic systems, with a focus on spiking neural networks and memristive devices.

Result: The analysis identifies attack methodologies, vulnerabilities, and highlights security primitives such as PUFs and TRNGs for improving secure neuromorphic computing.

Conclusion: This paper lays a groundwork to guide the creation of secure neuromorphic architectures by addressing emergent attack surfaces and proposing efficient mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing mimics brain-inspired mechanisms through spiking neurons and energy-efficient processing, offering a pathway to efficient in-memory computing (IMC). However, these advancements raise critical security and privacy concerns. As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications. We approach this analysis from diverse perspectives, from attack methodologies to countermeasure strategies that integrate efficiency and protection in brain-inspired hardware. This review not only maps the current landscape of security threats but provides a foundation for developing secure and trustworthy neuromorphic architectures.

### [259] [Building a Robust Risk-Based Access Control System to Combat Ransomware's Capability to Encrypt: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16795)
*Kenan Begovic,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Qutaibah Malluhi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time, machine learning-driven access control system for detecting and managing suspicious encryption on Linux without disrupting legitimate activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of stopping unauthorized encryption activities like ransomware while ensuring legitimate encryption processes remain uninterrupted.

Method: The method involves a probabilistic, risk-based access control system that uses machine learning (ML) with mandatory access control policies. It utilizes high-resolution kernel-function traces obtained through Linux's ftrace framework to build a dataset, which supports a supervised ML classifier and interpretable rules enforced using SELinux policies.

Result: The proposed system provides fine-grained behavioral monitoring surpassing traditional system call-only telemetry while avoiding computational overhead associated with virtualization-based methods. Evaluation shows strong detection quality and rule-based responsiveness, despite non-trivial resource consumption during burst I/O.

Conclusion: This ML-driven, trace-based system is an efficient, explainable, and practical encryption control mechanism for preventing unauthorized cryptographic activity in Linux, although further optimization is needed in the production version for enterprise deployment.

Abstract: Ransomware core capability, unauthorized encryption, demands controls that identify and block malicious cryptographic activity without disrupting legitimate use. We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment. The result is a practical path from behavioral tracing and learning to enforceable, explainable, and risk-proportionate encryption control on production Linux systems.

### [260] [Conformal prediction for full and sparse polynomial chaos expansions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16636)
*A. Hatstatt,X. Zhu,B. Sudret*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper integrates conformal prediction methods into Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCEs) to improve prediction interval calibration and coverage, outperforming traditional methods like bootstrap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PCEs are efficient in surrogate modeling, they lack robust frameworks to quantify local model errors, particularly with small datasets. Conformal predictions offer a solution with their statistically rigorous and model-agnostic approach.

Method: Two conformal prediction methods, full and Jackknife+, are integrated into full and sparse PCEs. Computational optimizations and adjustments for the regression algorithm structure were introduced to ensure valid prediction intervals.

Result: The enhanced PCE models yield better-calibrated prediction intervals with superior coverage compared to methods like bootstrap, maintaining acceptable computational costs.

Conclusion: The integration of conformal prediction techniques into PCEs improves their reliability and predictive accuracy, demonstrating the merit of conformal methods in surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCEs) are widely recognized for their efficient computational performance in surrogate modeling. Yet, a robust framework to quantify local model errors is still lacking. While the local uncertainty of PCE prediction can be captured using bootstrap resampling, other methods offering more rigorous statistical guarantees are needed, especially in the context of small training datasets. Recently, conformal predictions have demonstrated strong potential in machine learning, providing statistically robust and model-agnostic prediction intervals. Due to its generality and versatility, conformal prediction is especially valuable, as it can be adapted to suit a variety of problems, making it a compelling choice for PCE-based surrogate models. In this contribution, we explore its application to PCE-based surrogate models. More precisely, we present the integration of two conformal prediction methods, namely the full conformal and the Jackknife+ approaches, into both full and sparse PCEs. For full PCEs, we introduce computational shortcuts inspired by the inherent structure of regression methods to optimize the implementation of both conformal methods. For sparse PCEs, we incorporate the two approaches with appropriate modifications to the inference strategy, thereby circumventing the non-symmetrical nature of the regression algorithm and ensuring valid prediction intervals. Our developments yield better-calibrated prediction intervals for both full and sparse PCEs, achieving superior coverage over existing approaches, such as the bootstrap, while maintaining a moderate computational cost.

### [261] [Generative Confidants: How do People Experience Trust in Emotional Support from Generative AI?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16656)
*Riccardo Volpato,Simone Stumpf,Lisa DeBruine*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study explores how users develop trust in generative AI used for emotional support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies the need to understand how people develop trust in generative AI in the context of emotional support, given the increasing use of these systems for companionship.

Method: The authors conducted a qualitative study involving 24 users of generative AI for emotional support through diary entries, chat transcripts, and in-depth interviews.

Result: Findings suggest trust is driven by personalization, nuanced mental models of the AI, and users' control over interactions, but some homogeneous AI behaviors may hinder critical trust-related awareness.

Conclusion: The study highlights trust-building elements and potential challenges, providing implications for enhancing generative AI's role in emotional support and its overlap with future therapeutic applications.

Abstract: People are increasingly turning to generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) for emotional support and companionship. While trust is likely to play a central role in enabling these informal and unsupervised interactions, we still lack an understanding of how people develop and experience it in this context. Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work.

*Simon Lämmer,Mark Colley,Patrick Ebel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces Generative Traffic Agents (GTA), a scalable simulation method for predicting transportation choices using persona-based agents powered by language models, compared against real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of predicting large-scale, context-sensitive transportation behaviors using traditional methods, which rely on handcrafted rules and costly data collection, making them unsuitable for early-stage technology or policy evaluations.

Method: GTA employs persona-based agents powered by large language models to simulate transportation choices. It generates artificial populations using census-based sociodemographic data and creates activity schedules and mode choices without handcrafted rules.

Result: The GTA was evaluated in Berlin-scale experiments, showing it can replicate general mobility patterns (e.g., modal split by socioeconomic status) but also revealed systematic biases in trip length and mode preference.

Conclusion: GTA presents a novel approach to simulate urban transportation behavior, offering a scalable and human-like method for exploring future mobility policies and technologies' potential impacts, though biases remain a limitation.

Abstract: People's transportation choices reflect complex trade-offs shaped by personal preferences, social norms, and technology acceptance. Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.

TL;DR: This paper investigates privacy concerns in human-AI romantic relationships by studying participants' experiences, finding increased intimacy impacts privacy boundaries, and emphasizing the need to rethink privacy in such relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored safety and privacy risks in AI-facilitated romantic relationships.

Method: An interview study with 17 participants was conducted to explore their experiences and privacy perceptions in romantic stages with AI partners.

Result: The study found diverse forms of AI-human relationships, with AI perceived as having agency, influencing privacy boundaries and personal disclosure. Intimacy deepened privacy concerns, and platform features impacted privacy dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the evolving privacy landscape in human-AI intimacy and the need to reconsider existing privacy frameworks to address emerging concerns.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLM-based applications are being developed to facilitate romantic relationships with AI partners, yet the safety and privacy risks in these partnerships remain largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate privacy in human-AI romantic relationships through an interview study (N=17), examining participants' experiences and privacy perceptions across stages of exploration, intimacy, and dissolution, alongside platforms they used. We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, platform affordances and diverse romantic dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI intimacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior and theoretical guarantees of kernel smoothing methods when data resides on compact manifolds.

Method: The paper employs mathematical derivations and statistical analysis based on compact manifold assumptions, proving finite sample bounds and asymptotic results.

Result: Finite sample bounds for kernel smoothing and its derivatives are derived, along with Berry-Esseen bounds that establish asymptotic normality. Applications to density estimation and graph Laplacians are noted.

Conclusion: Kernel smoothing techniques are validated theoretically for compact manifolds, showing their robustness and wider applicability in various domains like regression analysis and graph-based methods.

Abstract: Under the assumption that data lie on a compact (unknown) manifold without boundary, we derive finite sample bounds for kernel smoothing and its (first and second) derivatives, and we establish asymptotic normality through Berry-Esseen type bounds. Special cases include kernel density estimation, kernel regression and the heat kernel signature. Connections to the graph Laplacian are also discussed.

### [265] [Parametric Mean-Field empirical Bayes in high-dimensional linear regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16842)
*Seunghyun Lee,Nabarun Deb*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies parametric empirical Bayes estimation in high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression, deriving results for the variational empirical Bayes (vEB) estimator and its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze the performance of the variational empirical Bayes (vEB) estimator in high-dimensional settings and to address its limitations in scaling dimensions.

Method: The authors derive the asymptotic distribution of the vEB estimator, characterize its phase transition behavior, and propose a debiasing technique for scenarios where its performance deteriorates.

Result: The vEB estimator is shown to be optimal for $p=o(n^{2/3})$ but suffers sub-optimal performance at higher dimensions. Proposed methods enhance its performance in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides both theoretical insights and practical solutions for improving empirical Bayes estimation in challenging high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of parametric empirical Bayes estimation of an i.i.d. prior in high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression, with random design. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the variational Empirical Bayes (vEB) estimator, which approximately maximizes a variational lower bound of the intractable marginal likelihood. We characterize a sharp phase transition behavior for the vEB estimator -- namely that it is information theoretically optimal (in terms of limiting variance) up to $p=o(n^{2/3})$ while it suffers from a sub-optimal convergence rate in higher dimensions. In the first regime, i.e., when $p=o(n^{2/3})$, we show how the estimated prior can be calibrated to enable valid coordinate-wise and delocalized inference, both under the \emph{empirical Bayes posterior} and the oracle posterior. In the second regime, we propose a debiasing technique as a way to improve the performance of the vEB estimator beyond $p=o(n^{2/3})$. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

*Benedikt Fesl,Fatih Capar*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces recurSIC, a low-complexity learning-based MIMO detection framework for edge-constrained receivers, achieving strong detection performance by combining successive interference cancellation and learned processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in 5G RedCap and IoT devices is achieving low-complexity MIMO detection that supports high-order modulation and provides soft information for advanced decoding, within the constraints of limited computational and memory resources.

Method: The proposed recurSIC combines successive interference cancellation (SIC) with learned processing stages to create a lightweight detection framework. It utilizes multi-path hypothesis tracking, a single forward pass, and minimal parameters to balance performance and complexity.

Result: Numerical experiments in realistic wireless conditions demonstrate recurSIC's strong performance in both hard and soft detection while maintaining very low computational and memory requirements.

Conclusion: RecurSIC is a practical and efficient solution for MIMO detection on edge-constrained devices, offering high performance and compatibility with modern wireless systems like 5G and IoT applications.

Abstract: Low-complexity multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection remains a key challenge in modern wireless systems, particularly for 5G reduced capability (RedCap) and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. In this context, the growing interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices must be balanced against stringent constraints on computational complexity and memory while supporting high-order modulation. Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count. Numerical results in realistic wireless scenarios show that recurSIC achieves strong hard- and soft-detection performance at very low complexity, making it well suited for edge-constrained MIMO receivers.
