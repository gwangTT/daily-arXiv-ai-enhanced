However, many dynamical properties of macroscale cortical\nactivity are well captured by instead describing the activity as propagating\nwaves across the cortical surface, constrained only by the surface's\ntwo-dimensional geometry. It thus remains an open question why the local\ngeometry of the cortex can successfully capture macroscale cortical dynamics,\ndespite neglecting the specificity of Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections\n(FNPs) which are known to mediate the rapid and non-local propagation of\nactivity between remote neural populations. Here we address this question by\ndeveloping a novel mathematical model of macroscale cortical activity in which\ncortical populations interact both by a continuous sheet and by an additional\nset of FNPs wired independently of the sheet's geometry. By simulating the\nmodel across a range of connectome topologies, external inputs, and timescales,\nwe demonstrate that the addition of FNPs strongly shape the model dynamics of\nrapid, stimulus-evoked responses on fine millisecond timescales ($\\lessapprox\n30~\\text{ms}$), but contribute relatively little to slower, spontaneous\nfluctuations over longer timescales ($> 30~\\text{ms}$), which increasingly\nresemble geometrically constrained dynamics without FNPs. Our results suggest\nthat the discrepant views regarding the relative contributions of local\n(geometric) and non-local (connectomic) cortico-cortical interactions are\ncontext-dependent: While FNPs specified by the connectome are needed to capture\nrapid communication between specific distant populations (as per the rapid\nprocessing of sensory inputs), they play a relatively minor role in shaping\nslower spontaneous fluctuations (as per resting-state functional magnetic\nresonance imaging).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a mathematical model to study the interplay between cortical geometry and fast axonal projections in shaping macroscale brain activity.

Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases.
