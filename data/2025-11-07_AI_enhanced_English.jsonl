Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are\nessential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including\nevent-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current\ntensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack\nthe flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study\nintroduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel\ntensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance\nclassification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality\nreduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a\nnovel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme\nto iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature\nrepresentation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant\nPARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and\nMI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.\nBenchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the\ntraditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art\nperformance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and\nPARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%\n> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more\nefficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.\nThis offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI\nand broader neuroimaging applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a novel tensor-based feature extraction method that improves EEG classification accuracy for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).", "motivation": "Current tensor-based approaches for EEG classification lack flexibility to fully capture neural activity complexity, necessitating improved dimensionality reduction methods.", "method": "The study proposes Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), which extends Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA) by utilizing interpretable forward models and a deflation scheme to extract discriminant features iteratively.", "result": "Benchmarking against ERP and MI EEG datasets showed BTTDA significantly outperforms traditional HODA in ERP decoding (ROC-AUC = 91.25%) and moderately improves MI decoding accuracy.", "conclusion": "BTTDA provides an efficient, interpretable technique for EEG dimensionality reduction in BCIs, demonstrating adaptability and strong classification potential."}}

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we\nprovide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this\nparadigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,\nIterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for\nenhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a method to enhance decision-making abilities of large language models (LLMs) by minimizing regret through iterative self-tuning and natural-language training signals.", "motivation": "Large language models, originally designed for language tasks, often struggle with decision-making problems, especially in achieving low regret or balancing exploration-exploitation in dynamic environments.", "method": "The proposed Iterative RMFT process involves iteratively generating decision trajectories, selecting low-regret examples, and fine-tuning the base model on these examples without relying on external decision-making algorithms or rigid templates.", "result": "Iterative RMFT improves the decision-making performance of LLMs across different models and tasks by leveraging flexible, model-generated reasoning mechanisms.", "conclusion": "The method provides a robust, flexible, and theoretically sound post-training framework, significantly enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities across varied scenarios."}}
