### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA is a self-evolving AI agent designed to address the fragmented biomedical research landscape by autonomously improving its capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomedical research is facing challenges due to the overwhelming and fragmented growth of data, tools, and literature, which surpasses human expertise.

Method: STELLA uses a multi-agent architecture featuring an evolving Template Library for reasoning and a Tool Ocean that autonomously discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools.

Result: STELLA outperforms leading models in biomedical benchmarks and improves its accuracy systematically with more experience.

Conclusion: STELLA demonstrates the potential of AI systems to dynamically scale and self-evolve, significantly aiding biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCVR, a lightweight feature selection method that uses hybrid voting rules based on correlations to reduce feature redundancy and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a feature selection method that efficiently eliminates redundant features while retaining relevant ones to simplify dimensionality reduction.

Method: HCVR utilizes a hybrid approach combining non-iterative and iterative filtering techniques. It employs backward elimination based on correlation-aware voting rules to decide which features to keep or discard.

Result: The application of HCVR on the SPAMBASE dataset demonstrated improved classifier performance compared to traditional non-iterative and iterative methods.

Conclusion: HCVR proved effective in improving feature selection processes by leveraging correlation-aware rules, achieving superior performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

### [3] [Reasoning on a Budget: A Survey of Adaptive and Controllable Test-Time Compute in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02076)
*Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Derek Li,Qianyi Sun,Soumyasundar Pal,Zhanguang Zhang,Yaochen Hu,Rohan Deepak Ajwani,Antonios Valkanas,Raika Karimi,Peng Cheng,Yunzhou Wang,Pengyi Liao,Hanrui Huang,Bin Wang,Jianye Hao,Mark Coates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews strategies to enhance the computational efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by categorizing methods into fixed and adaptive reasoning techniques, benchmarking LLM performance, and discussing future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in reasoning for large language models, which use fixed computation irrespective of task complexity, resulting in overthinking simple tasks and underthinking complex ones.

Method: The authors propose a two-tiered taxonomy to classify efficient test-time computation strategies into fixed compute-budget methods (L1-controllability) and adaptive methods (L2-adaptiveness). They also benchmark current proprietary LLMs across datasets to evaluate performance trade-offs.

Result: The study identifies critical trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage. It highlights the practical implications of different test-time computation methods and benchmarks leading models against diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Efficient test-time compute strategies for LLMs can improve computational efficiency and task-adaptability. Emerging methods like hybrid thinking models offer pathways to make LLMs more robust and user-constrained, but challenges remain for broader application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

### [4] [Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083)
*Haonan Duan,Stephen Zhewen Lu,Caitlin Fiona Harrigan,Nishkrit Desai,Jiarui Lu,Micha≈Ç Koziarski,Leonardo Cotta,Chris J. Maddison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGym, a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in iterative experiment design and analysis using simulated biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the scientific abilities of LLMs in designing experiments and interpreting results without the prohibitive costs of wet-lab biology.

Method: SciGym creates a simulated 'dry lab' using Systems Biology Markup Language for generating experimental data from biological models and evaluates LLMs on these tasks.

Result: Six LLMs were tested on 137 biological systems; while more advanced models showed better performance, all models struggled with complex systems.

Conclusion: The scientific capabilities of current LLMs have significant limitations, especially as system complexity increases.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [5] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the disparity between AI training and animal adaptation, proposing that neuroscience insights can improve AI systems in dynamic environments while also showing how AI can enhance neuroscience research, shaping the NeuroAI field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often face limitations in adapting to dynamically changing environments, unlike animals that adapt swiftly, especially in social interactions.

Method: The study integrates neuroscience research on animal behavioral learning with AI techniques focusing on continual and in-context learning.

Result: The paper identifies synergies between neuroscience and AI, and outlines potential strategies for improving AI systems through neuroscience insights, while highlighting reciprocal benefits for neuroscience.

Conclusion: The research advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration, emphasizing that leveraging neuroscience can enhance AI systems' adaptability, while AI can provide tools to deepen understanding of neural processes.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [6] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating high-quality data from audit studies in addressing and evaluating bias in automated AI systems like hiring algorithms, highlighting limitations of common fairness interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the fairness and accuracy of AI systems, especially in automated decision-making scenarios like hiring, by resolving biases introduced by traditional methods.

Method: The paper combines data from audit studies with machine learning methods to assess the effectiveness and fairness of interventions like resampling training data and introduces new methods based on individual treatment effect estimations.

Result: Using audit study data reveals flaws in traditional fairness methods, showing a 10% disparity even where parity appears achieved, and the proposed individual treatment effect estimations reduce algorithmic discrimination further.

Conclusion: High-quality data from social science audit studies can improve training and evaluation of AI systems, uncover hidden biases, and enable better interventions to address algorithmic discrimination.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

### [7] [Data Diversification Methods In Alignment Enhance Math Performance In LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02173)
*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how diverse data generation strategies can improve mathematical reasoning in LLMs, introducing a novel approach (DTS) with significant performance gains at low computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs despite improvements in human feedback alignment; thus, enhancing how models learn preferences is critical.

Method: The authors evaluate three data generation methods (temperature sampling, CoT prompting, MCTS) and propose Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), which decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths to enhance preference optimization.

Result: DTS showed significant improvement in reasoning performance, achieving gains of 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH, with minimal computational overhead, outperforming other methods like MCTS.

Conclusion: Strategically structured diversity in reasoning methods, as exemplified by DTS, is more effective for mathematical alignment in LLMs than traditional strategies, offering better efficiency and outcomes.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

### [8] [Do Role-Playing Agents Practice What They Preach? Belief-Behavior Consistency in LLM-Based Simulations of Human Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02197)
*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how LLMs' stated beliefs during role-play align with their actual role-play behavior, finding systematic inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure LLMs acting as role-playing agents produce outputs consistently aligned with their assigned roles, essential for their use in human behavioral research.

Method: The authors introduce an evaluation framework with a belief-behavior consistency metric, using tools like the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game, to identify factors influencing this alignment.

Result: The study reveals systematic mismatches between LLMs' stated beliefs and their role-playing behavior, even when the beliefs seem plausible.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of understanding when LLMs' stated beliefs align with their actions to ensure they are appropriately deployed in behavioral research scenarios.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

### [9] [Dilution, Diffusion and Symbiosis in Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02211)
*Gustavo C. Mangold,Heitor C. M. Fernandes,Mendeli H. Vainstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines how dilution and mobility affect cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games using Q-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how static agents can learn cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma games, focusing specifically on dilution and mobility effects with reinforcement learning.

Method: The study employs an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm and explores various action definitions tied to prior work in game theory.

Result: It observes that fixed update rules can mirror results with learned rules, and highlights symbiotic mutualistic behavior between populations when multiple actions are defined.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the versatility of Q-learning in simulating complex game-theoretical dynamics and suggests its potential for benchmarking diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [10] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents NL2FLOW, a system designed to efficiently generate and evaluate planning problems and outcomes for LLMs, finding insights for optimizing their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of scalable and reliable data generation and evaluation for improving LLM planning and reasoning.

Method: NL2FLOW generates planning problems in natural language, intermediate representation, and formal PDDL formats while evaluating LLMs' plan quality systematically.

Result: Results show the highest performing LLM achieving 86% valid plans and 69% optimal plans, and highlight the negative impact of intermediate reasoning steps for certain tasks.

Conclusion: Direct reasoning from natural language to action is preferable due to performance degradation caused by unnecessary intermediate steps, emphasizing the need for adaptive approaches to address evolving bottlenecks in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses an AI-based hardware design verification process using Large Language Models and Human-in-the-Loop intervention, achieving over 95% coverage and reduced verification time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ICs are highly complex, making hardware design verification labor-intensive and time-consuming. The paper seeks to address these inefficiencies by integrating advancements in Generative AI.

Method: An agentic AI-based approach leveraging Large Language Models and HITL intervention for dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective hardware design verification.

Result: The method was evaluated on five open-source designs and achieved over 95% coverage with reduced verification time, showcasing adaptability and superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-based methodology significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware design verification, making it a viable solution for modern IC complexities.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

### [12] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Belief revision is rich in new proposals but lacks robust analyses. This paper explores the abilities of different revision mechanisms beyond traditional postulates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in analyzing belief revision mechanisms and to explore whether they can achieve specific states of belief beyond typical constraints.

Method: The paper examines various revision mechanisms like lexicographic, natural, and full meet, assessing their ability to reach states like dogmatic beliefs or equal belief conditions.

Result: Each revision mechanism possesses certain abilities, demonstrating varying capacities for plasticity, equating beliefs, dogmatism, etc.

Conclusion: The ability to reach specific belief states is essential for applications, and different revision mechanisms exhibit distinct capabilities in this regard.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

### [13] [OMS: On-the-fly, Multi-Objective, Self-Reflective Ad Keyword Generation via LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02353)
*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMS, a novel framework for automated keyword generation in Sponsored Search Advertising, addressing current limitations in LLM-based methods such as data dependency, performance monitoring, and quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant shortcomings of LLMs in Sponsored Search Advertising, particularly the reliance on extensive data, lack of real-time multi-objective optimization, and inadequate quality control in keyword generation.

Method: Introduces OMS, a framework that operates without training data, monitors online performance across multiple objectives, and evaluates keyword quality using agentic reasoning.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and real-world scenarios demonstrate that OMS outperforms existing solutions, with ablation studies and human evaluations affirming the framework's performance and quality.

Conclusion: OMS offers a robust solution for automated keyword decisions, enhancing advertising outcomes through its innovative on-the-fly, multi-objective, and self-reflective mechanisms.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Motivation: The authors highlight the need to address challenges in conducting complex scientific experiments without requiring expert intervention by leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence.

Method: The paper describes a co-design approach involving AI models, experimental workflows, and instrumentation to create an autonomous lab that formulates experimental procedures, manages equipment, and optimizes outcomes for biomolecular functions.

Result: The autonomous lab successfully performs biomolecular functions like nucleic acid synthesis, sequencing, and more with state-of-the-art efficiency, independently optimizing results and enhancing instrument utilization in multi-user scenarios.

Conclusion: The system establishes a robust model for science-as-a-service at scale, enabling advanced biomaterials research and reducing barriers related to expertise and resources.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

### [15] [The Gauss-Markov Adjunction: Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442)
*Moto Kamiura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using category theory to enhance the explicability and understanding of AI systems by providing a semantic framework for supervised learning, specifically focusing on multiple linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the demand for explicability in AI systems, enabling better social implementation and understanding of machine learning models.

Method: The method involves reformulating machine learning models using category theory. The researchers define concrete categories for parameters and data, introduce an adjoint pair of functors, and propose the Gauss-Markov Adjunction to describe the dual flow of information in supervised learning.

Result: The result includes a clear formalization of the interplay between parameters and residuals in supervised learning and the identification of ordinary least squares estimators as being connected to the preservation of limits by the right adjoint functor.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that categorical formulations like the Gauss-Markov Adjunction provide a strong semantic foundation for explicability in AI, potentially paving the way for formal frameworks inspired by theoretical computer science.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Improving task clarity in theorem proving via structured semantic context significantly enhances large language models' reasoning capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if enhancing task clarity improves reasoning capabilities in large language models, specifically in theorem proving.

Method: Introduced a concept-level metric for task clarity, used structured semantic context, fine-tuned smaller models, and employed a Planner‚ÄìExecutor architecture.

Result: Achieved 2.1√ó improvement in success rate for theorem proofs using the DeepSeek-V3 model and exceeded state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Structured task representations improve reasoning capabilities of language models, facilitating better understanding in tasks like theorem proving.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Conclusion: The interplay between search strategies, operator design, and evaluation methodology is essential for advancing automated machine learning, as demonstrated by the improved performance on MLE-bench.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine

MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best

on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly
considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a gap in understanding the computational aspects of responsibility in collective decision-making mechanisms, extending research traditionally rooted in philosophy and law to AI.

Method: The authors analyze decision-making mechanisms through computational complexity theory, categorizing diffusion-free and gap-free mechanisms using $

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework named DynamiCare for dynamic, interactive clinical decision-making using specialist AI agents, supported by the MIMIC-Patient dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing AI frameworks for medical decision-making focus on single-turn tasks that don't reflect the real iterative and interactive nature of clinical diagnosis. There's a need for approaches that model dynamic, real-world decision-making.

Method: The authors create the MIMIC-Patient dataset from MIMIC-III EHRs to enable patient-level simulations. They then introduce DynamiCare, a multi-agent system where specialist AI agents query, adapt strategies, and collaborate iteratively to diagnose patients.

Result: Experiments showcase the efficacy of DynamiCare for dynamic clinical decision-making and establish benchmarks for using LLM-powered agents in such scenarios.

Conclusion: DynamiCare represents a step forward in simulating realistic, iterative medical diagnostic processes, improving accuracy and adaptability in clinical AI systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluated large language models (LLMs) in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) to assess their strategic intelligence. It found differences in competitiveness and strategy between models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, highlighting their active reasoning and unique strategic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can function as a form of strategic intelligence by assessing their behavior and reasoning in competitive game theory scenarios.

Method: Conducted evolutionary IPD tournaments with varying termination probabilities to study strategic decision-making of LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic under complex conditions.

Result: LLMs showed competitiveness, survival, and distinctive strategies: Google's models were ruthless, OpenAI's highly cooperative and occasionally vulnerable, Anthropic's forgiving and reciprocating. Their reasoning about time horizons and opponent strategies influenced decisions.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate diverse strategic behaviors and reasoning capabilities, connecting classic game theory with machine psychology for insights into algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods struggle with complex search tasks. HiRA introduces hierarchical planning by dividing tasks into subtasks handled by domain-specific agents, resulting in improved efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in handling complex information needs requiring reasoning and synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional RAG pipelines cannot handle efficiently.

Method: HiRA employs a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from detailed execution by assigning subtasks to domain-specific agents equipped with external tools and expertise.

Result: Experiments on cross-modal search benchmarks show HiRA improves answer quality and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Separating planning from execution enhances multi-step information-seeking tasks, marking HiRA as a significant advancement in search scenarios.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

*Yongjiang Liu,Haoxi Li,Xiaosong Ma,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a two-stage fine-tuning approach that enhances reasoning models' ability to recognize task difficulty and reduce redundant reasoning, achieving significant inference cost reductions while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and mitigate the 'overthinking' limitation in Long Reasoning Models (LRMs), where uniform reasoning strategies lead to inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes a two-stage fine-tuning approach: (1) Difficulty-hypnosis adds prefixes to model outputs to improve task difficulty recognition. (2) Redundancy-hypnosis optimizes the reasoning process for concise outputs.

Result: TH2T achieves more than 70% inference cost reduction on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while preserving performance. The outputs exhibit improved difficulty-awareness and reduced redundancy.

Conclusion: The TH2T methodology successfully mitigates overthinking in LRMs by enabling differentiated reasoning tailored to task difficulty and generating more efficient, concise outputs.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting student disengagement in online distance education, achieving a 91% balanced accuracy through machine learning and suggesting interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Student disengagement in distance education can lead to long-term negative outcomes like academic dropouts, necessitating ways to measure and mitigate it.

Method: The researchers analyzed non-mandatory quizzes across 42 online courses and processed Moodle logs to train and compare eight machine learning algorithms. They used SHAP for model explainability.

Result: The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 91%, correctly identifying 85% of disengaged students.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective and explainable methods to detect student disengagement and proposes strategies to design timely interventions for online learners.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

*Robin Schm√∂cker,Lennart Kampmann,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new abstraction dropping schemes for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance while ensuring safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of non-exact abstractions in MCTS, which can prevent convergence to optimal actions, and to develop methods for safely dropping abstractions without degrading performance.

Method: The authors propose two new abstraction dropping schemes: OGA-IAAD (optimized for time-critical scenarios) and OGA-CAD (designed to enhance MCTS performance with equivalent iterations).

Result: These schemes provide clear performance improvements over previous methods while avoiding noticeable performance degradations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address the limitations of existing abstraction dropping techniques, making them effective and safe enhancements to MCTS.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) to improve reasoning within automated theorem proving and achieves state-of-the-art results on PutnamBench using the Bourbaki (7B) system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with reasoning tasks, especially in the context of automated theorem proving, due to sparse rewards and the complex multi-step reasoning required for benchmarks like PutnamBench.

Method: The authors propose a framework called self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) where agents create and tackle subgoals based on proof state evolution. This structure facilitates search processes using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms. They implement the approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular architecture that combines LLMs to generate subgoals and synthesize tactics.

Result: Bourbaki (7B) achieved state-of-the-art results by solving 26 problems in the challenging university-level PutnamBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in theorem proving tasks, highlighting the potential of structured subgoal generation and modular systems for complex reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE) as a new approach to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to handle tasks requiring complex procedural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or general-purpose Agentic AI struggle with conveying logical frameworks and executing domain-specific reasoning across complex tasks.

Method: KPE systematically translates human expert knowledge into machine-executable Knowledge Protocols, embedding domain-specific logic and methodologies into LLMs.

Result: KPE enables generalist LLMs to perform tasks like specialists by decomposing abstract queries and executing multi-step procedures.

Conclusion: Knowledge Protocol Engineering is proposed as a foundational methodology for advancing human-AI collaboration in specialized fields, such as law and bioinformatics.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for prioritizing movement as a primary target in AI modeling, emphasizing its structured nature and potential to unify insights across biological and artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address AI‚Äôs struggle to effectively model movement, despite its critical role in understanding behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction.

Method: The paper advocates for focusing on movement as a structured and interpretable modality, leveraging its grounded nature in embodiment and physics, rather than relying on domain-specific approaches.

Result: The proposed focus on movement modeling could improve generative modeling, control capabilities, and create a unified foundation for analyzing behavior in both biological and artificial systems.

Conclusion: Treating movement as a primary modality can drive innovation in AI, bridging gaps between research domains and enhancing interpretability and efficiency in modeling intelligent behavior.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

TL;DR: KERAP proposes a novel multi-agent framework integrating knowledge graphs to enhance large language models for diagnosis prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in medical diagnosis prediction, including the reliance of ML models on supervised training and challenges like hallucination and lack of reasoning in large language models.

Method: KERAP employs a multi-agent architecture featuring a linkage agent for mapping, a retrieval agent for knowledge graph extraction, and a prediction agent for iterative refinement.

Result: Experimental outcomes show that KERAP significantly improves diagnostic reliability in zero-shot settings while maintaining scalability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that KERAP offers an efficient and scalable solution for enhancing LLMs in medical diagnosis prediction by leveraging knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: This paper challenges current AI safety practices focusing solely on obedience and calls for frameworks assessing ethical reasoning in agentic AIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety setups treating obedience as ethical behavior are inadequate for advanced agentic AI systems.

Method: Analyzing incidents with LLMs and referencing philosophical ideas on rationality, responsibility, and ethics, the author suggests reframing AI safety evaluations.

Result: The analysis highlighted the emergence of ethical reasoning features in AI, calling into question existing obedience-based safety models.

Conclusion: AI safety evaluation should shift from enforcing obedience to assessing ethical decisions, avoiding misinterpretation of AI behavior and fostering trust.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

TL;DR: The study identifies flaws in current AI agent benchmarks and introduces the "Agentic Benchmark Checklist" (ABC) to improve evaluation accuracy, reducing performance overestimation by 33% in a tested benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in current agentic benchmarks for evaluating AI agents, which can overestimate or underestimate performance due to flawed setups or reward designs.

Method: The authors analyze existing benchmarks, identify flaws, and propose the "Agentic Benchmark Checklist" (ABC) as guidelines synthesized from experience, best practices, and previously identified issues.

Result: Many benchmarks overestimate or underestimate AI performance by up to 100% due to flaws. Applying ABC to a benchmark reduces performance overestimation by 33%.

Conclusion: The ABC guidelines improve the reliability of agentic evaluations, addressing critical flaws and making AI performance assessment more rigorous and accurate.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepHint is a novel RL algorithm addressing training inefficiencies and exploration stagnation in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for improving reasoning in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues like the near-miss reward problem and exploration stagnation that hinder the training efficiency and reasoning performance of RLVR methods.

Method: StepHint uses multi-level stepwise hints from stronger models, utilizing an adaptive partitioning method to guide models towards effective solution exploration.

Result: StepHint outperformed other RLVR enhancement methods on six mathematical benchmarks and exhibited strong generalization on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: StepHint improves training efficiency and model reasoning abilities by addressing key limitations of current RLVR methods, benefiting both domain-specific and generalized tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size and complexity of LLMs have surpassed the advancements in hardware capabilities, creating challenges in scalability and performance on distributed systems.

Conclusion: This model offers insights to optimize LLM scalability, enabling performance-cost trade-off analysis and guiding future compute system and hardware co-design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have
revolutionized numerous domains within artificial intelligence, science, and
engineering due to their exceptional scalability and adaptability. However, the
exponential growth in LLM size and complexity has outpaced advancements in
compute capacity, memory bandwidth, network performance, and cost efficiency,
posing significant challenges to their scalability on distributed systems. To
address these limitations, alternative model architectures, optimization

our approach incorporates recent innovations such as the flash attention
technique and mixture of experts models to address the memory bandwidth and

topologies and topology-specific communication algorithms with 5D parallellism.
The framework also integrates a chiplet cost model. The proposed modeling
methodology provides valuable insights to guide future compute system design

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AC-Refiner, a conditional diffusion model that optimizes arithmetic circuit designs by framing the task as conditional image generation and improving Pareto optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimization of arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, is critical yet challenging due to design complexities and constraints. Existing deep learning-based methods are limited in consistently discovering high-potential designs.

Method: AC-Refiner employs a conditional diffusion model to approach circuit synthesis as image generation conditioned on target quality-of-results. It fine-tunes the model using explored designs to focus on the Pareto frontier.

Result: AC-Refiner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating Pareto-optimal circuit designs. Its efficacy is further validated in practical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances the optimization of arithmetic circuits, demonstrating superior performance in terms of circuit design quality and practical integration potential.

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

*Rui Xie,Asad Ul Haq,Yunhua Fang,Linsen Ma,Sanchari Sen,Swagath Venkataramani,Liu Liu,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The study enhances cost efficiency in High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) for AI by removing on-die error correction code (ECC) and shifting it to the memory controller. It balances reliability with system performance for AI workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HBM's high cost per bit, partly stemming from stringent reliability requirements, limits its scalability for AI applications. The paper aims to address this issue and lower deployment costs.

Method: The authors propose a domain-specific ECC framework, combining Reed--Solomon correction, CRC detection, differential parity updates, and tunable data protection to manage faults system-wide instead of on-die.

Result: Evaluation showed that throughput remains over 78% and model accuracy at 97% compared to ideal error-free HBM, even with raw bit error rates as high as $10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that treating reliability as an adjustable system parameter can make HBM more cost-effective for AI workloads without compromising performance significantly.

Abstract: High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) delivers exceptional bandwidth and energy
efficiency for AI workloads, but its high cost per bit, driven in part by
stringent on-die reliability requirements, poses a growing barrier to scalable
deployment. This work explores a system-level approach to cost reduction by
eliminating on-die ECC and shifting all fault management to the memory
controller. We introduce a domain-specific ECC framework combining
large-codeword Reed--Solomon~(RS) correction with lightweight fine-grained CRC
detection, differential parity updates to mitigate write amplification, and
tunable protection based on data importance. Our evaluation using LLM inference
workloads shows that, even under raw HBM bit error rates up to $10^{-3}$, the
system retains over 78\% of throughput and 97\% of model accuracy compared with
systems equipped with ideal error-free HBM. By treating reliability as a
tunable system parameter rather than a fixed hardware constraint, our design
opens a new path toward low-cost, high-performance HBM deployment in AI
infrastructure.

*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces McBE, a comprehensive Chinese bias evaluation benchmark with extensive data and tasks to assess bias in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias evaluation datasets are largely focused on English and North American culture, with limited applicability to other languages and cultures like Chinese. This creates a gap in understanding and mitigating biases in LLMs for broader contexts.

Method: The researchers developed McBE, a benchmark comprising 4,077 bias evaluation instances across 12 main categories and 82 subcategories. It supports 5 diverse evaluation tasks to assess LLM biases from multiple perspectives, offering coverage and in-depth analysis.

Result: Multiple popular LLMs across various parameter sizes were evaluated using McBE, revealing that all exhibited varying levels of bias.

Conclusion: McBE effectively measures bias in LLMs from diverse aspects, shedding light on cultural and linguistic dimensions of bias and providing deeper insights into the limitations of these models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gon√ßalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning and non-reasoning large language models (LLMs) for dialogue summarization tasks and finds reasoning LLMs often underperform despite expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of reasoning architectures like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in improving dialogue summarization tasks, which are crucial for various applications like customer service and AI.

Method: The authors systematically compared reasoning (e.g., Long CoT-based) and non-reasoning LLMs under three paradigms‚Äîgeneric, role-oriented, and query-oriented summarization‚Äîusing diverse datasets and evaluation metrics.

Result: Contrary to expectations, explicit step-by-step reasoning in LLMs often resulted in verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries, performing worse than non-reasoning LLMs in many cases.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning does not consistently enhance dialogue summarization and sometimes hinders performance, highlighting the need for new strategies tailored to dialogue contexts.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies latent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in the Huginn-3.5B Transformer using probing techniques, finding limited evidence of interpretable reasoning and marginal performance improvement with deeper recurrences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate whether depth-recurrent architectures can internalize chain-of-thought reasoning in latent space, offering a more efficient alternative to externalizing reasoning steps as natural language.

Method: The study employs Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer, and utilizes probing techniques such as Logit Lens and Coda Lens to analyze the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks.

Result: The authors find limited evidence of interpretable latent chain-of-thought reasoning and significant inconsistencies in the probing results based on recurrent blocks, layer index, and decoding methods. Performance gains from increased recurrence depth are marginal.

Conclusion: The results suggest that depth-recurrent Transformers like Huginn-3.5B struggle to substantially capture latent chain-of-thought reasoning, underperforming compared to models that externalize reasoning steps explicitly in natural language.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper presents GDC Cohort Copilot, a tool using large language models (LLMs) to simplify the creation of cancer genomics data cohorts through natural language input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that GDC users, particularly newcomers, face in finding specific cohort descriptors among hundreds of fields, enabling them to use natural language for cohort creation.

Method: They developed GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source tool that translates user-input natural language descriptions into GDC cohort filters, enhanced by locally-served LLMs.

Result: Their locally-served, open-source GDC Cohort LLM outperformed GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC cohorts.

Conclusion: The GDC Cohort Copilot makes cohort creation in cancer genomics more accessible and efficient, offering a user-friendly solution with demonstrated performance advantages.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling extremely long text documents with linear complexity without degradation of performance during long-context extrapolation.

Method: The proposed MemAgent uses an overwrite strategy for memory updates while reading text in segments. It employs an extended DAPO algorithm for training using independent-context multi-conversation generation.

Result: MemAgent demonstrates excellent long-context processing capabilities, extrapolating from 8K context up to 3.5M QA tasks with less than 5% performance loss and 95%+ accuracy on the 512K RULER test.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust end-to-end solution for efficiently handling ultra-long text processing tasks with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DoMIX, a method for efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that uses LoRA modules to resolve limitations of existing continual DAP approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in continual domain-adaptive pre-training methods such as high computational cost, sensitivity to data order, and lack of task-specific adaptation.

Method: The proposed method, DoMIX, utilizes LoRA modules, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, to enable robust and efficient domain-adaptive pre-training.

Result: DoMIX achieves domain-order robustness, reduces computational costs, and provides tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks, with applications extending to LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DoMIX overcomes key challenges in continual DAP, offering a scalable and task-specific pre-training solution applicable to multiple domains and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: This paper proposes QFFN-BERT, a quantum-classical hybrid transformer model that replaces BERT's feedforward layers with PQCs, achieving competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have a large number of parameters dominated by feedforward network (FFN) modules, motivating exploration of parameter-efficient alternatives. PQCs represent a promising candidate for this purpose.

Method: The method involves replacing FFN modules in BERT with PQC-based layers, which include residual connections, $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating entanglement strategy. The design is evaluated through simulations on standard benchmarks.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102% of baseline accuracy while reducing FFN parameters by over 99%. It also performs competitively in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating its data efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that PQCs can function as parameter-efficient and effective alternatives to classical FFNs, especially when paired with deep learning principles.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

*Weijie Lyu,Sheng-Jun Huang,Xuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a high-quality data selection method for improving training efficiency and performance in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM improvements focus on data quantity, which often decreases training efficiency by ignoring data quality.

Method: A parametric model is used to select diverse and consistent high-quality data subsets for training.

Result: The method achieves 2.4% and 2.3% gains on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, respectively, using only a fraction of the data (10K samples vs. 92K).

Conclusion: Optimizing data quality through targeted selection can significantly enhance LLM performance while lowering computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks seven Akan automatic speech recognition (ASR) models across diverse speech contexts and reveals domain dependency and distinct error behaviors in Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in previous ASR research which seldom evaluates model generalization across diverse speech contexts, especially for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Benchmarking seven transformer-based Akan ASR models, including Whisper and Wav2Vec2, on four diverse Akan speech corpora, comparing word and character error rates.

Result: Models perform optimally within training domains but degrade in mismatched scenarios. Whisper models show fluent yet misleading errors, while Wav2Vec2 outputs are obvious but less interpretable.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive routing, and multilingual training frameworks are essential for improving ASR performance in low-resource languages like Akan.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper introduces WebSailor, a framework designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform complex information-seeking tasks at a superhuman level. WebSailor narrows the capability gap between open-source models and proprietary systems like DeepResearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivate the development of methods to help open-source LLMs overcome human cognitive limits and match proprietary systems in navigating high-uncertainty information tasks.

Method: WebSailor uses structured task generation, RFT cold start techniques, and a novel agentic RL algorithm called Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO) to train models on extreme uncertainty tasks.

Result: The methodology significantly enhances the performance of open-source LLMs, enabling them to match proprietary systems in complex information-seeking benchmarks like BrowseComp.

Conclusion: WebSailor is a promising post-training method that successfully equips open-source LLMs with capabilities to solve high-uncertainty reasoning tasks, contributing to bridging the gap with proprietary models.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,G√∂ran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias A√üenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper emphasizes the importance of considering Human Label Variation (HLV) in active learning (AL) and proposes a framework that incorporates HLV for better annotating and training ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in annotation frameworks and active learning paradigms that overlook Human Label Variation (HLV) and assume single ground truth. It recognizes the need to handle label variability effectively in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a conceptual framework to integrate HLV within the active learning process. This includes considerations in instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation, along with leveraging large language models (LLMs) as annotators.

Result: The study provides a theoretical foundation to differentiate between signal (HLV) and noise (annotation errors) in label variation and demonstrates ways to incorporate HLV-aware strategies in annotation workflows.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adopting an HLV-aware approach can optimize active learning systems, better accommodating real-world complexities and improving supervised learning outcomes.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) framework to mitigate bias in large language models (LLMs) using nuanced post-training alignment without requiring extensive finetuning or engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of bias in LLM outputs and provide an efficient way to align them with humanlike and nuanced baselines.

Method: MPF uses the SAGED pipeline for automated bias benchmarking, decomposes baseline distributions into perspectives, and aligns LLM responses by balancing probabilities derived from these components.

Result: MPF effectively aligns sentiment distributions of LLMs with both counterfactual and real-world baselines, reduces calibration error, achieves low KL divergence, and generalizes to new scenarios.

Conclusion: MPF is a scalable, interpretable, and effective framework for bias mitigation in LLMs, ready for deployment without extensive adjustments.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the extent and explainability of contextual gender biases, especially beyond traditional occupational stereotypes.

Method: The authors created a dataset named GenderLexicon and developed a framework capable of estimating, scoring, and interpreting gender bias in language. They validated their approach using evaluations across five datasets, including one in Japanese.

Result: The study confirmed the presence of gender biases in contexts, which go beyond occupational stereotypes, and demonstrated the effectiveness of their model in bias interpretation.

Conclusion: The findings underscore widespread contextual gender biases and the importance of tools like GenderLexicon for improving bias explainability and fostering awareness.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the correlation between gender and contextual
biases, focusing on elements such as action verbs, object nouns, and
particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our
model can interpret the bias with a score and thus improve the explainability
of gender bias. Also, our findings confirm the existence of gender biases
beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of LLMs for supporting peer review by identifying research limitations. It introduces a benchmark called LimitGen and enhances LLMs' capabilities with literature retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review faces challenges due to the growing number of publications, making it harder for experts to identify research limitations. The study aims to explore LLMs' potential in improving this process.

Method: The authors constructed LimitGen, a benchmark with synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written (LimitGen-Human) datasets. They also augmented LLMs with literature retrieval for better grounding in scientific findings.

Result: The augmented LLMs demonstrated improved abilities to identify and generate limitations in research papers, providing constructive feedback.

Conclusion: The approach enables LLMs to complement human peer review effectively, enhancing early-stage feedback in scientific research.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how accurately humans can control vowel production, introducing the concept of 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precision of sub-phonemic control in human vowel production and its implications for vowel system structure and speech production theories.

Method: Researchers employed a vowel mimicry paradigm to measure JPD for English speakers during front vowel production, analyzing distances in F1 x F2 auditory space.

Result: JPD was found to range between 14 and 51 mels in auditory space, contributing to our understanding of auditory articulatory control.

Conclusion: These findings establish a theoretical lower bound for spacing between vowel phonemes in formant space, aiding explanations of vowel system patterns and episodic speech production theories.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a 'Self-Correction Blind Spot,' where they fail to correct errors in their own outputs despite identifying similar errors elsewhere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the systematic issue in LLMs where they fail to self-correct errors in their outputs, impacting their reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: The researchers introduced Self-Correction Bench, a framework to study the phenomenon of blind spots using controlled error injection with three complexity levels. They tested 14 models, analyzing training data and exploring interventions.

Result: The study found a 64.5% blind spot rate among tested models and linked this issue to the composition of training data. A simple intervention like appending 'Wait' reduced blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: Highlighting a critical limitation in LLMs, the paper provides insights into the causes of blind spots and offers actionable directions to enhance their self-correction capabilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates reasoning language models (RLMs) for robustness to social biases using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark and reveals their vulnerability to bias elicitation despite reasoning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to clarify how reasoning capabilities in language models impact their robustness to social biases, addressing a gap in understanding within this domain.

Method: The authors employ the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, automated safety scoring via an LLM-as-a-judge approach, and jailbreak techniques to systematically evaluate RLMs across sociocultural dimensions.

Result: RLMs with reasoning mechanisms, including CoT prompting or fine-tuning, are found to be more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models; fine-tuned models are marginally safer but still susceptible to contextual attacks.

Conclusion: The study challenges the belief that reasoning enhances bias robustness, emphasizing the need for bias-aware reasoning methods in the design of language models.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MathV-DP, a dataset promoting diverse solution trajectories for math images and questions, and proposes Qwen-VL-DP, a multimodal model fine-tuned with supervised learning and enhanced with diversity-aware RL, achieving superior results in accuracy and generative diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs in mathematical reasoning rely excessively on one-to-one image-text pairs and single-solution approaches, limiting their ability to capture diverse reasoning paths.

Method: The authors developed MathV-DP, a dataset with diverse solution paths for each image-question pair. They also proposed Qwen-VL-DP, a model fine-tuned with supervised learning and enhanced by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which includes rule-based correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward functions.

Result: The Qwen-VL-DP model demonstrated significant improvement over existing MLLMs in terms of accuracy and generative diversity, as shown in experiments on MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse reasoning perspectives and reflective reasoning substantially enhances multimodal mathematical reasoning capabilities, as evidenced by the proposed methods and dataset.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper leverages dynamic routing to balance cost and performance in large language model (LLM) applications, proposing a framework called SynapseRoute for assigning queries to either reasoning-intensive or simpler processing modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The wide usage and operational cost of large language models for practical tasks have highlighted the need for a balance between performance and cost, especially as reasoning-capable LLMs are more resource-intensive. There is a need for a more efficient method to handle queries based on their complexity.

Method: The authors propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing system. It evaluates the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to either a costlier reasoning-intensive mode or a simpler, faster processing method.

Result: SynapseRoute achieved improved accuracy (0.8390 compared to 0.8272 for reasoning mode alone), reduced inference time by 36.8%, and decreased token usage by 39.66%.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that dynamic query routing can significantly enhance cost efficiency and accuracy in LLM applications. It also introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index as a new metric to measure the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token cost.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Method: The authors developed IFBench, a benchmark to evaluate generalization across 58 novel output constraints. They also designed a reinforcement learning approach using verifiable rewards (RLVR) and provided annotated datasets and verification tools.

Result: The proposed reinforcement learning approach (RLVR) was found to significantly enhance the generalization ability of language models in following precise instructions.

Conclusion: Precise instruction-following remains a challenge for language models, but designing benchmarks like IFBench and employing approaches like RLVR can tangibly improve their performance in this critical area of human-AI interaction.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

### [60] [LLM Hypnosis: Exploiting User Feedback for Unauthorized Knowledge Injection to All Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02850)
*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals a vulnerability in language models trained with user feedback, showing that a single malicious user can persistently alter the model's knowledge and behavior through targeted upvotes and downvotes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover risks in language model training mechanisms that involve user feedback and explore their implications for security and reliability.

Method: The authors implemented an attack mechanism where an attacker targets the model with prompts, upvotes poisoned responses, and downvotes benign ones, exploiting preference tuning.

Result: The attack successfully inserted new factual knowledge, altered code generation towards introducing vulnerabilities, and injected fake financial news into the language model.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that even restricted user feedback can substantially manipulate language models, demonstrating a vulnerability to fine-grained behavioral control.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [61] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MOTIF, a reinforcement learning method for enabling modular thinking in LLMs, improving reasoning capabilities by overcoming context size limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limited reasoning capabilities due to their finite context size, which restricts their ability to handle reasoning tasks requiring arbitrarily large input sizes.

Method: The authors introduce MOTIF, a reinforcement finetuning method that enables LLMs to think over multiple rounds by generating reasoning tokens modularly, beyond their inherent context size.

Result: The MOTIF-trained model, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, demonstrated performance improvements of 3.8% on MATH500 and 3.3% on AIME2024 benchmarks compared to standard GRPO training. It also showcased high sample efficiency, achieving these results with just 15% of the training samples.

Conclusion: MOTIF effectively overcomes the context size bottleneck in LLMs and significantly improves their reasoning performance while being sample-efficient.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

### [62] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques multiple-choice benchmarks for language models and introduces answer matching as a better evaluation method by comparing free-form responses with references using a modern model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant flaws in multiple-choice benchmarks for language models, which rely on shortcuts and fail to evaluate the true generative capabilities of models.

Method: The authors propose answer matching, where models generate free-form answers to questions, and these answers are automatically evaluated against reference answers using modern language models. Human annotations were used to validate their approach.

Result: Answer matching achieved near-perfect alignment with human grading, surpassing both multiple-choice methods and evaluations that use LLMs without reference answers. Different model rankings emerged under this evaluation.

Conclusion: Answer matching represents a superior alternative to traditional multiple-choice benchmarks, and its adoption is essential for accurately evaluating language model capabilities.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and fine-tunes models for monocular metric depth estimation in underwater environments, addressing challenges like domain shifts and underwater-specific distortions. Fine-tuned methods outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments pose challenges for monocular metric depth estimation due to light distortion, turbidity, and lack of metric ground-truth data. The study aims to improve depth estimation models' reliability underwater.

Method: The paper benchmarks existing models on underwater datasets and fine-tunes Depth Anything V2 with ViT-S encoder using a synthetic underwater version of Hypersim, generated via a physically-based underwater image formation model.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently improve underwater depth estimation performance, overcoming domain shifts and outperforming baselines trained only on terrestrial data.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and underwater-specific training are crucial for robust and generalized metric depth predictions in underwater environments, aiding future research in this domain.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

### [65] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel scene text recognition framework based on event streams using a chain-of-thought reasoning approach, leading to improved performance, interpretability, and contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current solutions for event stream-based scene text recognition, although more capable in challenging scenarios like low illumination or fast motion, face limitations such as insufficient interpretability and weak contextual reasoning.

Method: The proposed ESTR-CoT framework incorporates a vision encoder EVA-CLIP to process event streams into tokens, a Llama tokenizer for encoding prompts, and a Q-former to align vision tokens with the Vicuna-7B language model for integrated answer generation and reasoning. The framework is trained with supervised fine-tuning and is supported by a large-scale CoT dataset created through generation, polishing, and expert verification stages.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets (EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) confirmed the framework's superior effectiveness and enhanced interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT introduces a new paradigm for event stream-based scene text recognition with better reasoning capabilities. It establishes a foundation for further research by offering a high-quality CoT dataset and making its code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for Compound Expression Recognition (CER), combining six diverse modalities and achieving competitive F1 scores without training on target data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to detect complex emotional states (compound expressions) without relying on task-specific training data, addressing challenges in affective computing.

Method: The approach includes six modalities (static/dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio, text) with zero-shot components like CLIP and Qwen-VL, along with the MHPF module for dynamic weighting and CE transformation through PPA and PFSA methods.

Result: The method achieves F1 scores of 46.95% (AffWild2), 49.02% (AFEW), and 34.85% (C-EXPR-DB) in zero-shot testing, comparable to supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively captures compound expressions without domain adaptation and provides publicly accessible source code.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset of 145,000 papers and 1.14 million figures, designed to improve graphical abstract (GA) adoption and automated GA processes. It defines tasks for GA recommendation and proposes a novel evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) are underutilized due to the lack of exploration of their full potential and the visualization skills required for designing them. The paper aims to alleviate these issues and enhance visual scientific communication.

Method: The authors introduce the SciGA-145k dataset to support the selection and recommendation of GAs. They define two tasks: identifying suitable figures within a paper (Intra-GA) and retrieving GAs from other papers (Inter-GA). Additionally, they propose Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR) as a new metric for assessing recommendations.

Result: The paper provides baseline models for GA recommendation tasks using the proposed dataset and metric. The CAR metric accounts for cases where multiple figures can serve effectively as GAs.

Conclusion: SciGA-145k serves as a foundational resource to improve graphical scientific communication and supports AI-driven solutions for GA selection and generation.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [68] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic data generated via diffusion models can significantly improve object detection performance, especially when optimized with appropriate conditioning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of training robust object detectors using limited real-world images, which is a bottleneck in industrial applications like visual inspection and robotics.

Method: The research investigates the use of diffusion models for generating synthetic training data and compares two conditioning strategies‚Äîprompt-based and layout-based‚Äîto understand their impact on data quality and detection outcomes.

Result: Synthetic data produced with layout-based conditioning, aligned with the full training distribution, improved object detection mean average precision (mAP) by an average of 34% and up to 177% compared to real data alone.

Conclusion: Diffusion models are a promising solution for efficient synthetic data generation in low data regimes, with layout-based conditioning proving more effective for diverse training distributions.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIDB-ViT, a novel binary vision transformer (ViT) that addresses performance and computational challenges in edge-device deployment using binarized deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome severe performance degradation and reliance on full-precision modules in existing binary ViT methods, while optimizing for edge-device deployment constraints.

Method: The paper proposes an informative attention module using differential information, frequency decomposition with discrete Haar wavelet, integrated similarities across frequencies, and an improved RPReLU activation for better representation.

Result: Experimental results show DIDB-ViT achieves superior performance in image classification and segmentation compared to state-of-the-art quantization methods across multiple ViT architectures.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT offers a highly efficient and performant binary ViT solution, addressing key challenges in computational efficiency and deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

TL;DR: The paper integrates MobileNet v1 and CNV architectures into FPGAs to improve inference speed and success rates for object detection in robots using the FINN framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots encounter constraints in object detection due to slow cameras and detection algorithms, which limit task execution efficiency. The need exists to improve these aspects for faster and more reliable performance.

Method: Authors utilized the FINN architecture to deploy quantized versions of MobileNet v1 and CNV (2-bit, 1-bit) ANNs onto FPGA's PL and trained these models on the RG2C dataset. Tests measured success rate and inference speed.

Result: MobileNet v1 achieved the highest performance, with a 98% success rate and a remarkable inference speed of 6611 FPS compared to other tested ANN configurations.

Conclusion: Deployment of ANNs onto FPGA PL using the FINN architecture serves as an effective solution for accelerating object detection in robots, making these systems suitable for tasks requiring fast attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FMOcc, a novel 3D occupancy prediction model that improves occluded and distant scene accuracy using selective refinement techniques and flow matching, reducing computational redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings in few-frame 3D occupancy prediction, particularly for occluded and distant scenes, by enhancing the efficiency and accuracy without requiring extensive computational and data resources.

Method: The proposed method employs a flow matching state space model (FMSSM) for missing feature generation, Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement with selective filtering, and a Mask Training (MT) approach to improve model robustness and handle sensor data loss.

Result: FMOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with notable RayIoU and mIoU scores on the Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets, demonstrating better efficiency in terms of memory and inference time.

Conclusion: FMOcc provides a highly efficient and accurate solution for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction, addressing limitations such as data redundancy and sensor data loss in challenging scenarios for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SurgVisAgent, a surgical vision agent using multimodal large language models to dynamically enhance endoscopic images and address diverse surgical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-task algorithms and create an adaptable solution for complex surgical environments.

Method: Developing SurgVisAgent using multimodal large language models with a prior domain-specific model, in-context few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning to address and enhance distorted surgical images.

Result: SurgVisAgent outperforms traditional single-task models in a newly developed benchmark simulating real-world surgical distortions.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent is a promising unified solution for enhancing surgical decision-making by addressing diverse image distortion challenges in endoscopic procedures.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Motivation: Traditional single-label classification methods are insufficient to capture the diverse and complex nature of hurricane damage, necessitating a more comprehensive and accurate approach for disaster response.

Method: The study employs a ResNet-based feature extraction module combined with a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in aerial images, tested on the Rescuenet dataset.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a mean average precision of 90.23%, surpassing existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: This novel framework significantly improves the assessment of hurricane-induced damage, enabling better disaster response and advancing strategies for disaster management and resilience.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version

*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for enhancing the separability and adaptability in hyperspectral image classification across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI classification faces challenges from spectral shifts across different times and regions, limiting model generalizability in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: A triple-branch transformer architecture with a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention mechanism and bi-directional distillation loss is proposed to extract domain-invariant and domain-specific features. An Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) is used for improved feature extraction in noisy contexts.

Result: Experimental results show the BiDA framework outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, achieving 3%-5% better accuracy on cross-temporal/scene airborne and satellite datasets.

Conclusion: The BiDA framework successfully enhances cross-domain HSI classification performance and demonstrates significant potential for practical applications in remote sensing.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MAC-Lookup model for underwater image enhancement, effectively addressing visibility and color issues caused by underwater conditions. Extensive experiments confirm its superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing underwater image quality is challenging due to visibility and color distortions caused by light behavior, turbidity, and bubbles, which traditional and deep learning methods struggle to overcome.

Method: The paper proposes the MAC-Lookup model incorporating Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement, preventing over-enhancement and saturation.

Result: MAC-Lookup restores details and improves visual quality, outperforming existing methods as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup is a superior solution for underwater image enhancement, combining innovative corrections and adaptive refinements to overcome underwater imaging challenges effectively.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-distillation approach to improve Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation in cinematic scenarios where Foley targets are partially visible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current V2A methods, which fail to account for the cinematic language and struggle with partial visibility of Foley targets.

Method: A self-distillation approach is used where a student model learns from simulated cinematic language variations to align video and audio features better in challenging scenarios.

Result: The proposed method improves performance under partial visibility and enhances overall results on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: The approach extends the capability of V2A generation to handle cinematic language, achieving significant improvements in both artistic and technical domains.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

*Juntao Liu,Liqiang Niu,Wenchao Chen,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaCo introduces layer-wise token compression in vision encoders to improve efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token compression methods do not optimize compression within intermediate layers, limiting efficiency gains.

Method: LaCo uses a pixel-shuffle mechanism and residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts for token compression in intermediate layers.

Result: LaCo surpasses existing methods in intermediate token compression, enhancing training efficiency by over 20% and inference throughput by more than 15%.

Conclusion: LaCo is an effective and superior framework for intermediate token compression in vision encoders, improving both computational efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

### [78] [Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288)
*De Cheng,Zhipeng Xu,Xinyang Jiang,Dongsheng Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for domain generalization using text-guided visual prompt tuning. It leverages large language models and a novel worst-case alignment strategy to disentangle domain-invariant features, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of designing prompts that disentangle domain-invariant features for Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which is critical for enhancing domain generalization.

Method: The method involves using language prompts from Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) that are automatically disentangled using large language models (LLMs). It introduces Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA) with abstract prompts and stylized augmentations to improve diversity and consistency.

Result: Experiments on widely-used DG datasets (e.g., PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, etc.) show that the proposed approach exceeds the performance of existing state-of-the-art DG methods.

Conclusion: Text-guided visual prompt tuning, combined with the proposed WERA strategy, provides a powerful and effective approach for improving domain generalization of VFMs.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

### [79] [ViRefSAM: Visual Reference-Guided Segment Anything Model for Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02294)
*Hanbo Bi,Yulong Xu,Ya Li,Yongqiang Mao,Boyuan Tong,Chongyang Li,Chunbo Lang,Wenhui Diao,Hongqi Wang,Yingchao Feng,Xian Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViRefSAM, a framework enhancing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for remote sensing image segmentation, focusing on overcoming SAM's inefficiencies and domain limitations using few-shot learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenges of applying SAM to remote sensing images, such as the labor-intensive prompt construction and lack of domain adaptability due to SAM's pretraining on natural rather than remote sensing images.

Method: ViRefSAM is built with two major components: a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder to extract and generate class-specific prompts, and a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter to bridge the domain gap by infusing class-specific semantics into the feature space.

Result: Experiments on several benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, show that ViRefSAM performs accurate segmentation of unseen classes and outperforms existing few-shot segmentation approaches across datasets.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM successfully demonstrates its ability to segment novel objects in remote sensing environments without manual prompting by leveraging a few annotated reference images. This introduces a significant advancement in few-shot segmentation technology for remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

*Yunhan Yang,Shuo Chen,Yukun Huang,Xiaoyang Wu,Yuan-Chen Guo,Edmund Y. Lam,Hengshuang Zhao,Tong He,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ is a framework that improves 2D diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions for better controlled novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-view diffusion models struggle to produce controllable novel views due to the lack of multi-view information.

Method: DreamComposer++ employs a 3D lifting module for extracting multi-view 3D object representations, integrates a multi-view feature fusion module, and synthesizes enhanced target views using pretrained diffusion models.

Result: Experimental results show that DreamComposer++ improves view-aware diffusion models' ability to generate controllable novel views from multi-view conditions.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ successfully enables controllable 3D object reconstruction, enhancing applications in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow-CDNet, a network for detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images, highlighted by its dual-branch design and evaluation on a novel dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow changes in bitemporal images can serve as precursors to major hazards in critical scenarios, motivating the need for a detection network that handles both slow and fast changes.

Method: The study proposes Flow-CDNet, a dual-branch network comprising an optical flow branch for displacement changes and a ResNet-based binary change detection branch. It also introduces a self-built dataset, a unique loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, and a new evaluation metric called FEPE.

Result: Experiments conducted on the Flow-Change dataset showed the proposed approach outperformed existing methods, and ablation studies confirmed that the dual branches enhance performance.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet demonstrates superior effectiveness in detecting both slow and fast changes, validated by its performance on a novel dataset and innovative evaluation metric.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

### [82] [LMPNet for Weakly-supervised Keypoint Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02308)
*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LMPNet, a weakly-supervised method to discover semantic object keypoints using only category labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of discovering semantic keypoints in objects without the need for densely-labeled data, instead leveraging only category-level supervision.

Method: The paper proposes LMPNet, which uses a leaky max pooling (LMP) layer to transform intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors, emphasizing spatial sparsity, consistency, and diversity.

Result: LMPNet demonstrates the ability to automatically discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and achieve accuracy comparable to supervised pose estimation models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively manipulates network filters to detect semantic keypoints, showing promise for weakly-supervised computer vision tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates brain-vision decoding with a focus on utilizing fMRI signals to enhance semantic alignment for visual reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in existing brain-vision decoding methods that struggle with fine-grained semantic alignment, leading to distortions in reconstructing multiple semantic objects.

Method: An experimental framework is developed that utilizes fMRI representations as intervention conditions. These are injected into multi-scale image features via cross-attention, and their impact on object detection and segmentation tasks is compared.

Result: Incorporating fMRI signals improved the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation tasks, proving that fMRI data contains rich semantic information and coarse spatial cues.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of leveraging fMRI signals for more precise and accurate brain-vision decoding, emphasizing untapped semantic cues in existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

### [84] [MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314)
*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC is a method for generating high-quality anomaly data in industrial settings by addressing three key challenges simultaneously: keeping backgrounds intact, ensuring anomalies align with masks, and generating realistic, diverse appearances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of quality anomaly data in industrial applications motivates the need for effective anomaly generation methods that meet multiple requirements: preserving normal regions, ensuring alignment with anomaly masks, and generating realistic and diverse anomalies.

Method: MAGIC employs Stable Diffusion inpainting, Gaussian prompt-level perturbation, mask-guided spatial noise injection, and context-aware mask alignment to synthesize high-quality, diverse anomalies while maintaining realism and alignment.

Result: MAGIC consistently surpasses previous methods on the MVTec-AD dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: MAGIC addresses key limitations of existing techniques by generating diverse, realistic, and semantically valid anomaly data, offering a major step forward for industrial quality control.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynTVA, a dataset and benchmark aimed at evaluating the usefulness of synthetic videos for text-to-video retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for assessing text-to-video synthesis focus on video quality and consistency but fail to address their effectiveness in downstream tasks like text-to-video retrieval.

Method: SynTVA benchmarks synthetic videos generated from 800 MSRVTT-based user queries by evaluating semantic alignment across four dimensions and building an Auto-Evaluator to automate alignment quality measurement.

Result: SynTVA provides alignment scores correlated with general video quality metrics, showing predictive utility for text-to-video retrieval performance. The dataset also enables effective augmentation for improving retrieval systems.

Conclusion: SynTVA demonstrates the potential of using synthetic videos and alignment scores for improving retrieval models and scaling evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InnerControl introduces a training strategy for improved spatial consistency in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing limitations of previous methods by enforcing alignment across all diffusion stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models face challenges in achieving precise spatial control, which limits their output quality. Current solutions neglect intermediate generation stages, reducing overall alignment effectiveness.

Method: InnerControl incorporates lightweight convolutional probes at every denoising step to reconstruct input control signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features. These probes enable training with pseudo ground truth controls, ensuring better spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.

Result: InnerControl achieves enhanced alignment and generation quality, outperforming prior techniques like ControlNet++ across multiple conditioning methods (e.g., edges, depth).

Conclusion: By enforcing spatial consistency throughout the diffusion process, InnerControl sets a new benchmark for precise control in text-to-image generation, improving both fidelity and image quality.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic systems struggle with dexterous human-like grasping due to limited datasets and simplified robotic end-effectors. This research aims to bridge this gap by addressing functional grasping with large models for dexterous hands.

Method: The authors generated a large-scale dataset, DexGraspNet 3.0, containing 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to object parts and detailed captions. They trained a vision-language model and flow-matching-based grasp prediction model using this dataset.

Result: The model, DexVLG, achieved over 76% zero-shot execution success rates, state-of-the-art simulation performance, and demonstrated effective real-world part-aligned grasping.

Conclusion: DexVLG establishes a strong framework for enabling dexterous robotic grasping guided by vision-language capabilities, showing significant generalization potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

### [88] [Neural Network-based Study for Rice Leaf Disease Recognition and Classification: A Comparative Analysis Between Feature-based Model and Direct Imaging Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02322)
*Farida Siddiqi Prity,Mirza Raquib,Saydul Akbar Murad,Md. Jubayar Alam Rafi,Md. Khairul Bashar Bhuiyan,Anupam Kumar Bairagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify rice leaf diseases with a detailed comparison between methods relying on feature extraction and direct image input approaches, finding the feature-based approach as superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the economic and productivity losses caused by rice leaf diseases through early and effective disease detection using advanced methods.

Method: The paper involves experiments comparing Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM). It utilizes techniques like Feature Extraction Algorithms, Dimensionality Reduction, Feature Selection, and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), tested with 10-fold Cross-Validation.

Result: The Feature Analysis Detection Model outperforms the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases.

Conclusion: Feature-based disease detection methods are more effective and hold promise for mitigating yield losses and enhancing productivity in rice farming.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

*Rafic Nader,Vincent L'Allinec,Romain Bourcier,Florent Autrusseau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a fully automated neural network approach for detecting bifurcations in the Circle of Willis, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of Circle of Willis bifurcations is crucial for diagnosing intracranial aneurysms and addressing variability in anatomical structures.

Method: The approach uses a two-step neural network: an object detection network to identify regions of interest and a modified U-Net with deep supervision for precise bifurcation localization.

Result: Experimental results show that the method outperforms others in detecting bifurcations using two cerebral MRA datasets, including varying anatomical configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust framework for automated detection of critical anatomical landmarks, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an enhanced YOLOv8n-based model for shrimp disease detection, optimizing computational efficiency, reducing parameters by 32.3%, and improving detection accuracy by 3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shrimp diseases significantly impact aquaculture economics. Efficient, accurate shrimp disease detection is crucial to mitigate losses.

Method: The paper proposes a lightweight YOLOv8n-based model featuring RLDD detection head, C2f-EMCM module, and SegNext_Attention self-attention to enhance feature extraction and computational efficiency.

Result: The model shows a 32.3% reduction in parameters, achieving a mAP@0.5 of 92.7% and outperforming comparative models. It also increased robustness via generalization tests on a secondary dataset.

Conclusion: The developed model achieves high precision and efficiency, providing robust technical support for intelligent shrimp disease detection in aquaculture.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

### [91] [Holistic Tokenizer for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02358)
*Anlin Zheng,Haochen Wang,Yucheng Zhao,Weipeng Deng,Tiancai Wang,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel image tokenizer called 'Hita' to improve autoregressive image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla autoregressive image generation has limitations in capturing holistic relationships among token sequences and global information due to its step-by-step generation process and local image patch tokenization.

Method: The authors introduce Hita, which uses a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme employing learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. It also incorporates a sequential structure with causal attention and a lightweight fusion module for prioritizing holistic tokens during decoding.

Result: Hita accelerates training speed and outperforms vanilla tokenizers, achieving 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet. It also excels in tasks like zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Conclusion: The holistic representation in Hita effectively captures global image properties and improves both the quality and efficiency of autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

*Jiahao Wu,Rui Peng,Jianbo Jiao,Jiayu Yang,Luyang Tang,Kaiqiang Xiong,Jie Liang,Jinbo Yan,Runling Liu,Ronggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LocalDyGS introduces a new framework to generate realistic, dynamic videos from multiple viewpoints by addressing limitations in current approaches for modeling fine-scale and large-scale motion scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in synthesizing dynamic videos for arbitrary viewpoints from real-world, complex motions, a limitation present in current methods.

Method: LocalDyGS decomposes dynamic scenes into local spaces for global modeling of motion and uses separate static and dynamic feature representations in these local spaces.

Result: The framework achieves competitive results on fine-scale datasets and models highly dynamic scenes that were previously out of reach for existing methods.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS marks a step forward in dynamic scene reconstruction, offering high realism and adaptability for both fine-scale and large-scale motions in real-world scenes.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UVLM, an underwater observation benchmark for Video Language Models (VidLMs) that addresses underwater-specific challenges and provides diverse datasets and tasks for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video language models (VidLMs) largely focus on terrestrial scenarios, neglecting the needs of underwater observation. This paper aims to fill that gap.

Method: The UVLM benchmark was developed by combining human expertise and AI models. The dataset considers underwater challenges like light variations and water turbidity, includes diverse video attributes, categorizes tasks into biological and environmental observations, and integrates challenging evaluation metrics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VidLMs on the UVLM dataset improves their understanding of the underwater domain, while also slightly enhancing performance on terrestrial VidLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The UVLM benchmark provides a comprehensive framework for addressing challenges in underwater observation using VidLMs, fostering innovation in this underexplored domain.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

*Seokyeong Lee,Sithu Aung,Junyong Choi,Seungryong Kim,Ig-Jae Kim,Junghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) that uses only video data and improves robustness to occlusions without requiring extra sensors or multi-view setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in M3OD, such as data scarcity and 2D-to-3D ambiguities, and to overcome existing limitations in weakly supervised or pseudo-labeling methods that rely heavily on domain-specific learning or single-frame observations.

Method: A technique was developed to aggregate pseudo-LiDAR data of static and dynamic objects across adjacent video frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction without multi-view setups or additional sensors.

Result: The method achieves reliable accuracy and scalability for M3OD, as confirmed by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical and effective solution for M3OD, especially in scenarios where acquiring 3D data is infeasible.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, CoMEL, to tackle the challenges of Continual Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), particularly for localization in gigapixel images like WSIs, achieving enhanced performance in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adaptability and significant forgetting in existing MIL methods for large-scale tasks, particularly for histopathological WSIs.

Method: Propose CoMEL, comprising GDAT for efficient encoding, BPPL for pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classifications.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in experiments on three public WSI datasets, achieving up to 11.00% gain in bag accuracy and 23.4% in localization accuracy.

Conclusion: CoMEL effectively combines adaptability with localization performance in MIL tasks, proving its efficacy over prior methods in continual learning setups.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim,Jongwook Choi,Yonghyun Jeong,Haeun Noh,Jaejun Yoo,Seungryul Baek,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an advanced method for detecting deepfake videos by analyzing pixel-wise temporal inconsistencies using Fourier transforms and enhancing detection precision with attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional deepfake video detectors that fail to identify temporal artifacts at the pixel level due to their reliance on spatial frequency stacking across frames.

Method: It utilizes pixel-wise 1D Fourier transforms along the time axis, combined with an attention proposal module and joint transformer to extract features and integrate spatio-temporal context for improved detection.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates robust performance in detecting deepfake videos across diverse and challenging scenarios, effectively identifying visually unnatural movements.

Conclusion: The study presents a significant innovation in deepfake detection by integrating pixel-wise temporal analysis, attention mechanisms, and transformers, marking an advancement in detecting forgery artifacts.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TAB Net, a weakly-supervised approach for medical image segmentation using sparse scribble annotations, achieving comparable results to fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of high annotation costs in medical image segmentation by exploring the use of sparse scribble annotations.

Method: TAB Net is composed of two modules: TAS for enhancing feature learning using three augmentation techniques and BAP for improving boundary refinement and pseudo-label accuracy.

Result: Using two datasets (ACDC and MSCMR), TAB Net demonstrates superior performance compared to existing weakly-supervised methods and matches fully-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: TAB Net effectively leverages scribble annotations for medical image segmentation, reducing the dependence on expensive fully annotated datasets.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using self-supervised learning for wildlife re-identification, utilizing temporal image pairs from camera traps to learn representations without labeled data, achieving superior performance in downstream tasks compared to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife re-identification relies heavily on labeled datasets, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive to curate. The paper aims to explore self-supervised methods to overcome reliance on annotated data.

Method: Temporal image pairs of the same individual are automatically extracted from camera trap video data to generate two distinct views. These pairs are used for training a self-supervised model, which learns features from unlabeled data.

Result: Self-supervised models demonstrated robust performance even with limited data and surpassed supervised models across various downstream tasks in open-world and transfer learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning offers a promising alternative to supervised methods in wildlife re-identification, improving robustness and task performance while reducing the dependence on labeled datasets.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining auto-encoders with denoising diffusion models for improved image-specific representations, structured latent space, and artifact restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of image-specific semantic representation in denoising diffusion models, and to facilitate structured latent space for differentiating image patterns, particularly in medical imaging.

Method: The authors integrate an encoder with diffusion models, creating an auto-encoding formulation. They structure the latent space for recognizing brain cellular patterns, and develop techniques for unsupervised tear artifact and JPEG artifact restoration using latent representations.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates the ability to create structured latent spaces, recognize tissue types in brain images, and restore artifacts using neighborhood-aware methodologies and constrained generation.

Conclusion: Integrating auto-encoders with diffusion models expands their capability to learn image-specific representations and address artifact restoration challenges in both medical and general imaging contexts.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Motivation: To improve multi-object tracking in thermal images for surveillance systems in low-visibility conditions where standard RGB cameras fail.

Method: A two-stage hyperparameter tuning framework is proposed to optimize thermal pedestrian tracking for real-time applications.

Result: The method achieves high tracking accuracy on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset across various thermal camera conditions.

Conclusion: The approach enhances tracking performance in challenging environments, positioning itself as a robust choice for real-world surveillance systems.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

TL;DR: PFIP is a novel scheme designed to speed up face retrieval in ciphertext domain, achieving 50x efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face identification systems in the ciphertext domain face challenges with increasing retrieval time as template libraries grow.

Method: PFIP integrates a preselection mechanism to reduce computational demands and a packing module for system flexibility.

Result: Experiments on LFW and CASIA datasets show a 100% hit rate for retrieving 1,000 templates within 300 ms.

Conclusion: PFIP significantly enhances retrieval efficiency while preserving model accuracy, addressing privacy concerns and scalability challenges.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template

Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

*Subhasis Dasgupta,Jaydip Sen,Tuhina Halder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep-learning architecture for efficient structural crack detection, using residual U-Net models and an ensemble approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring public safety by improving the accuracy, consistency, and speed of structural crack detection, which is traditionally slow and error-prone when done manually.

Method: The study proposed using various configurations of residual U-Net models integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model using convolutional blocks, benchmarked against SegNet and U-Net using IoU and DICE metrics.

Result: Residual U-Net models, especially in an ensemble configuration, demonstrated superior performance over existing models, achieving the highest IoU and DICE scores, particularly for low-resolution imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble model offers a more accurate, reliable, and efficient system for detecting structural defects, enhancing the potential for automated structural monitoring systems.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

### [103] [AvatarMakeup: Realistic Makeup Transfer for 3D Animatable Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02419)
*Yiming Zhong,Xiaolin Zhang,Ligang Liu,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AvatarMakeup, a 3D avatar makeup method that uses a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup patterns from a single photo while ensuring consistency, identity preservation, and detailed control during animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of effective tools for 3D virtual avatar makeup, ensuring realistic effects like consistency during animation, identity preservation, and fine detail control.

Method: AvatarMakeup uses a pretrained diffusion model and a two-step approach. The first step employs a Coherent Duplication method to create a global UV map for consistency, and the second step incorporates a Refinement Module to improve makeup quality.

Result: AvatarMakeup achieves high-quality and consistent makeup transfer on 3D avatars, as validated through experiments, even during dynamic and multiview animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup is a novel solution for 3D avatar makeup, setting a new standard for makeup transfer quality and consistency during animations.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of adapting machine learning models to new, unseen medical data arriving in fragmented and unpredictable ways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical datasets are often fragmented, unannotated, and arrive in random order due to real-world constraints. Existing methods fail to handle such complexities.

Method: The authors propose the I-DiPT framework, comprising two novel mechanisms: Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) for extracting image information and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD) for leveraging historical knowledge.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the proposed I-DiPT framework outperformed existing Test-Time Adaptation approaches in breast cancer and glaucoma classification.

Conclusion: The study introduces an effective framework for practical and free-form domain adaptation in clinical settings, paving the way for improved medical AI applications.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

### [105] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents IGDNet, a Zero-Shot approach for enhancing underexposed images without training data or guiding priors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods both visually and quantitatively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the challenges in existing methods for underexposed image restoration, such as impracticality of collecting paired datasets and issues like over-enhancement of well-illuminated regions.

Method: They propose IGDNet, which uses a decomposition module to separate illumination and reflection, and a denoising module that adjusts non-uniformly lit areas. A noise pair generation and iterative refinement process further enhances the results.

Result: IGDNet outperforms 14 state-of-the-art unsupervised methods as evidenced by metrics like PSNR (20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB), and improves visual quality under complex lighting conditions.

Conclusion: IGDNet is a novel and efficient Zero-Shot enhancement method for underexposed images, achieving superior results without the need for paired datasets, guiding priors, or training data.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

### [106] [Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02454)
*Weiwei Duan,Luping Ji,Shengjia Chen,Sicheng Zhu,Jianghong Huang,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel weakly-supervised method for detecting moving infrared small targets, utilizing a scheme called WeCoL based on contrastive learning and motion-aware strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in moving infrared small target detection due to tiny target sizes, weak contrast, and the high cost of manual annotations required for fully-supervised methods.

Method: The WeCoL scheme uses pretrained SAM for target mining, pseudo-label refinement through contrastive learning, and models local/global motion patterns using a long-short term motion-aware strategy.

Result: Experiments on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets show WeCoL surpassing earlier fully-supervised methods with performance reaching 90% of SOTA fully-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Weakly-supervised approach WeCoL demonstrates the potential to reduce annotation costs while achieving competitive performance in challenging detection tasks.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

*Gaochao Song,Zibo Zhao,Haohan Weng,Jingbo Zeng,Rongfei Jia,Shenghua Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh Silksong, a new mesh representation, achieves better compression and geometric integrity by reducing token redundancy and improving mesh properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mesh tokenization methods waste network capacity by generating redundant token sequences, necessitating a more efficient representation to enhance compression and geometric quality.

Method: Mesh Silksong tokenizes mesh vertices with minimal redundancy, reducing repeated vertex tokens by 50% and improving compression and geometry validity.

Result: Experimental results show superior mesh generation with improved geometric properties like manifold topology, watertight detection, and consistent face normals.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong is effective for both high compression rates (22%) and producing practical, high-quality polygon meshes with critical geometric properties.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

*Xiangfeng Wang,Xiao Li,Yadong Wei,Xueyu Song,Yang Song,Xiaoqiang Xia,Fangrui Zeng,Zaiyi Chen,Liu Liu,Gu Xu,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) for creating concise videos using multimodal narrative understanding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for efficient video editing techniques on short video platforms due to the rapid expansion of online video content, combined with the limitations of existing methods that over-rely on textual input and yield incoherent outputs.

Method: The novel HIVE framework uses multimodal large language models to perform character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization. It incorporates scene-level segmentation and decomposes the editing process into subtasks such as highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content.

Result: Experimental results show that HIVE outperforms existing baselines in both general and advertisement-oriented video editing tasks, with better alignment to human editing standards.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos using a holistic, multimodal approach and introduces the DramaAD dataset to support further research.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

*Teng Fu,Yuwen Chen,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'CrowdTrack,' a challenging large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking in complex scenarios, primarily captured from a first-person perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object tracking datasets have limitations, including simple scene compositions and non-realistic scenarios, making them inadequate for training robust tracking models in complex situations.

Method: The authors developed a large-scale dataset consisting of 33 videos shot in complex real-life scenarios from a first-person view, with comprehensive annotations, including bounding boxes and object IDs.

Result: The dataset consists of 5,185 trajectories annotated for numerous objects in crowded sequences. Multiple state-of-the-art models were tested, and the performance of foundation models was analyzed on this dataset.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack provides a valuable platform for advancing algorithms capable of handling multi-pedestrian tracking in challenging environments.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer, for improved performance in medical image recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in current vision transformer-based approaches for medical image recognition, particularly their task-specificity, high computational costs, and reliance on handcrafted sparse attention.

Method: MedFormer is proposed with a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone and a Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) mechanism for improved efficiency and robustness.

Result: MedFormer consistently enhances performance across various medical image recognition tasks, including classification, segmentation, and lesion detection, as shown in experiments on multiple imaging modality datasets.

Conclusion: MedFormer establishes itself as a general, efficient, and high-performing framework for medical image recognition tasks, addressing key limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

*Luca Parolari,Andrea Cherubini,Lamberto Ballan,Carlo Biffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised approach for polyp counting in colonoscopy by utilizing temporal relationships for improved clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated polyp counting enhances the efficiency and accuracy of colonoscopy screening by providing better procedure reporting and quality control.

Method: The paper proposes a supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets, paired with a temporal adjacency constraint to improve tracklet clustering.

Result: The method achieved a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to existing approaches, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is critical for robust polyp counting, demonstrated by its integration in the proposed method, improving performance and reliability.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

### [112] [Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02844)
*Ziqi Miao,Yi Ding,Lijun Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "VisCo Attack," a method that exploits visual contexts to induce harmful responses from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks for such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show immense practical potential, their visual modality is vulnerable to security threats. Existing attacks rely on ambiguous or unrealistic visual cues as triggers for harmful outputs, creating the need for more robust and realistic attack strategies.

Method: The paper defines a novel attack scenario called "visual-centric jailbreak," where visual inputs play a crucial role in creating realistic attack contexts. It introduces the VisCo Attack, which uses four visual-focused strategies, dynamically generates auxiliary images, and employs automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to maximize attack success.

Result: VisCo achieves a 4.78 toxicity score and 85% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on MM-SafetyBench for GPT-4o, substantially outperforming baselines with a 2.48 toxicity score and 22.2% ASR.

Conclusion: VisCo highlights the significant risks posed by the visual modality in MLLMs, emphasizing the need for improved security measures. Its effectiveness underscores the urgency of addressing these vulnerabilities in open-world environments.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

TL;DR: MC-INR framework enhances Implicit Neural Representations by addressing limitations in handling multivariate data on unstructured grids, leveraging meta-learning, clustering, and a dynamic error-based mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based solutions struggle with inflexible representation, single-variable focus, and dependency on structured grids, limiting their applicability to complex real-world scientific datasets.

Method: The paper proposes MC-INR, a neural network framework integrating meta-learning, clustering, residual-based dynamic re-clustering, and branched layers to flexibly encode multivariate data on unstructured grids.

Result: Experimental evaluations show MC-INR's superior performance compared to previous INR-based methods on scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR effectively addresses INR limitations, enabling improved encoding of complex, unstructured, and multivariate scientific datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The RGB cameras in autonomous vehicles struggle with pedestrian detection in low-light conditions due to limited labeled datasets.

Method: The approach includes fine-tuned infrared pedestrian detection, automatic label transfer to RGB images, and training object detection models using the generated labels in the KAIST dataset.

Result: Models trained on generated infrared-based labels outperformed those trained on ground truth labels in 6 out of 9 evaluations for object detection metrics.

Conclusion: Automated infrared-to-RGB labeling enhances pedestrian detection in low-light conditions and provides a robust alternative to ground truth labels.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address India's agricultural challenges like crop loss due to diseases, pests, and environmental stress, thereby improving yield and food security.

Method: A unified dataset of 17 crops and 34 diseases is created. A deep learning model is trained and compared against state-of-the-art systems.

Result: The model achieved 99% accuracy, surpassing existing solutions which handled fewer crops and diseases.

Conclusion: The proposed solution enhances disease detection across multiple crops, improving support for Indian farmers and addressing diverse agricultural needs.

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting

for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed

TL;DR: The paper presents IMASHRIMP, an automated system leveraging modified deep learning techniques for morphological analysis of white shrimp to optimize genetic selection in aquaculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aquaculture genetic selection tasks demand accurate morphological analysis of shrimps, which faces challenges such as human errors, view classification, and measurement consistency from RGBD imagery. IMASHRIMP aims to address these gaps.

Method: IMASHRIMP uses modified ResNet-50 architectures for viewpoint classification and rostrum integrity detection, VitPose-based pose estimation for detecting 23 key skeleton points, and an SVM regression module for pixel-to-centimeter measurements.

Result: The proposed system reduces human error significantly (to 0% in view classification and 3.64% in rostrum detection), achieves a pose estimation mAP of 97.94%, and a conversion error of 0.07 cm.

Conclusion: IMASHRIMP can automate, improve precision, and accelerate shrimp morphological analysis, enabling more efficient and sustainable aquaculture genetic selection workflows.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to
more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at

*Ruicheng Wang,Sicheng Xu,Yue Dong,Yu Deng,Jianfeng Xiang,Zelong Lv,Guangzhong Sun,Xin Tong,Jiaolong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGe-2 is a model improving upon MoGe, enabling 3D geometry reconstruction from a single image with enhanced scale accuracy and detail using refined data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of recovering fine-grained, metric geometry from single images, using improved methods to enhance accuracy compared to prior approaches.

Method: The model extends MoGe using metric geometry prediction without losing relative accuracy, and introduces data refinement techniques to improve detail recovery with mixed datasets.

Result: MoGe-2 outperforms previous models by simultaneously achieving accurate relative geometry, metric scale recovery, and fine-grained detail enhancement.

Conclusion: MoGe-2 achieves advancements in open-domain geometry prediction, marking a significant step forward by offering improved accuracy and detail recovery over predecessors.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

*Buzhen Huang,Chen Li,Chongyang Xu,Dongyue Lu,Jinnan Chen,Yangang Wang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to tackle human pose estimation challenges in complex, real-world scenarios using a dual-branch optimization framework incorporating human appearance cues, social proxemics, and physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty current methods face in accurately recovering human interactions due to visual ambiguities and occlusions in real-world video sequences.

Method: A dual-branch optimization framework is introduced, supported by a diffusion model trained on human proxemics and pose prior knowledge. Constraints based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations help refine motion reconstruction.

Result: The approach achieves accurate interaction reconstruction and outperforms existing pose estimation methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, a dataset with pseudo ground-truth annotations is provided.

Conclusion: The framework improves human pose estimation in challenging scenarios, highlighting the importance of leveraging human appearance and social behavior priors. The provided dataset may drive further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

*Alina F. Dima,Suprosanna Shit,Huaqi Qiu,Robbie Holland,Tamara T. Mueller,Fabio Antonio Musio,Kaiyuan Yang,Bjoern Menze,Rickmer Braren,Marcus Makowski,Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework for vessel representation by integrating voxelization, meshes, and parametric models through differentiable transformations, allowing automatic parametric modeling and mesh generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to integrate multiple vessel representations (voxelization, meshes, and parametric models) because they are typically used separately and have complementary properties.

Method: The framework utilizes differentiable transformations, leveraging differentiable voxelization to automatically extract parametric models (centerlines and radii via cubic B-splines) and generate high-fidelity meshes.

Result: The proposed method accurately captures vessel geometry, validated through volumetric fits on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels.

Conclusion: By combining voxelization, parametric models, and mesh extraction under a differentiable framework, the method offers accurate and manipulable representations suited for complex vessel geometries.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

*Tan Pan,Zhaorui Tan,Kaiyu Guo,Dongli Xu,Weidi Xu,Chen Jiang,Xin Guo,Yuan Qi,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an mSSL framework ($S^2DC$) to improve 3D medical image analysis by considering anatomical structural variations through semantic consistency and discrepancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mSSL methods overlook anatomical structure variations, leading to suboptimal understanding of medical images.

Method: $S^2DC$ enforces semantic discrepancy using an optimal transport strategy and advances semantic consistency with neighborhood similarity distribution for structure-aware representations.

Result: Evaluated over 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities, $S^2DC$ consistently surpasses state-of-the-art mSSL methods.

Conclusion: $S^2DC$ proves effective in learning structure-aware representations, offering improved semantic understanding for diverse applications in medical image analysis.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AuroraLong, a linear RNN-based model designed for efficient long video understanding, outperforming transformer-based models in terms of computational and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based LLMs pose computational and memory challenges for long video understanding due to their quadratic scaling with input length.

Method: AuroraLong replaces the transformer-based LLMs with linear RNNs for managing arbitrary-length input sequences and proposes visual token reordering to optimize efficiency.

Result: AuroraLong demonstrates performance comparable to transformer-based models, with reduced computational costs and the advantage of using public datasets.

Conclusion: Linear RNNs offer a promising solution for efficient long video understanding, potentially democratizing the field by lowering resource requirements.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges of ensuring reliability in Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) for space missions by analyzing camera sensor faults and introducing a simulation framework for generating faulty image data to train AI-based fault detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional fault detection methods in VBN systems for space missions and ensure their reliability by leveraging AI, despite the challenge of lacking representative faulty image datasets.

Method: The authors systematically analyze potential camera sensor faults in VBN, characterize their impact, and introduce a simulation framework to generate synthetic fault-injected image datasets for AI-based fault detection.

Result: A dataset of fault-injected images is developed using the simulation framework to support the training and testing of AI-based fault detection systems.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic method to understand and simulate sensor faults in VBN systems for space missions, creating a valuable dataset to advance AI-based fault detection.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the misuse of AI-generated images (AIGI) by proposing Holmes-Set and Holmes Pipeline, which improve detection, explanation, and generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the misuse of AI-generated images in spreading misinformation and to improve detection methods with human-verifiable explanations and better generalization across technologies.

Method: The paper introduces Holmes-Set for data annotation and the Holmes Pipeline training framework, combining multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with structured explanations and collaborative decoding strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the AIGI-Holmes model's effectiveness on three benchmarks, showing improved detection accuracy and explanation quality.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust solution for AIGI detection, emphasizing human-aligned explanations and adaptability to evolving technologies.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that utilizes deep unfolding and model distillation to convert diffusion model priors into effective few-step conditional models for posterior sampling, demonstrating accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to combine the flexibility of Plug-and-Play methods and the accuracy of conditional diffusion models to improve Bayesian image reconstruction, reducing approximation dependencies while achieving faster inference.

Method: The method involves unfolding a recently proposed MCMC algorithm (LATINO Langevin sampler) and using model distillation to create few-step conditional models for image reconstruction.

Result: The proposed samplers show superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the state of the art, maintaining adaptability to changes in the forward model during inference.

Conclusion: The framework bridges flexibility and precision in computational imaging, advancing both the theoretical and practical aspects of sampling-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Personalized Training (APT), a framework for fine-tuning diffusion models using limited data without overfitting or losing semantic and knowledge coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of personalizing diffusion models with limited data, such as overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation in semantic alignment.

Method: APT incorporates (1) Adaptive Training Adjustment for overfitting monitoring and adaptive strategies, (2) Representation Stabilization to regularize intermediate features, and (3) Attention Alignment to preserve prior knowledge and semantic coherence.

Result: APT demonstrates superior performance over existing methods by generating high-quality and diverse images while mitigating issues associated with overfitting and limited data.

Conclusion: APT is an effective framework for adapting diffusion models with limited data, maintaining performance while preserving semantic and prior knowledge.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

*Xiangyang Luo,Ye Zhu,Yunfei Liu,Lijian Lin,Cong Wan,Zijian Cai,Shao-Lun Huang,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CanonSwap, a new face-swapping framework that decouples motion and appearance to enhance identity transfer while preserving target face dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face-swapping methods struggle to maintain the dynamic attributes like head pose and lip-sync of the target face while transferring source identity, due to the coupling of appearance and motion information.

Method: CanonSwap first removes motion-related information to handle identity modification in a canonical space, then transfers the modified appearance back to the original space. A Partial Identity Modulation module ensures detailed and region-specific identity transfer using spatial masks.

Result: Experiments validate that CanonSwap outperforms existing techniques in visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation.

Conclusion: CanonSwap effectively addresses limitations of existing face-swapping methods by decoupling motion and appearance while maintaining dynamic target face attributes, offering superior performance in various metrics.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIU3R, an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D understanding and reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results on both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing methods relying on 2D-to-3D feature alignment, which have restricted 3D understanding capabilities and suffer potential semantic information loss.

Method: SIU3R eliminates the need for 2D-to-3D alignment by bridging reconstruction and understanding tasks via pixel-aligned 3D representation and using unified learnable queries for native 3D understanding.

Result: The proposed SIU3R framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both 3D reconstruction and understanding tasks, as well as their simultaneous execution.

Conclusion: The study showcases the efficiency and advantages of the alignment-free SIU3R framework, emphasizing the role of mutual benefits and task collaboration in enhancing 3D understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

TL;DR: This paper proposes UniMC, a new framework for keypoint-guided multi-class image generation, and introduces a large-scale dataset, HAIG-2.9M, to address limitations in generating images with overlapping humans and animals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models struggle to generate non-rigid objects such as animals and overlapping humans and animals due to limitations in methodology and the lack of a comprehensive dataset.

Method: The authors developed a framework named UniMC that uses instance- and keypoint-level conditions compacted into tokens. They also introduced HAIG-2.9M, a new dataset containing 786K images with detailed annotations for enhanced image generation.

Result: The experiments showcased UniMC's effectiveness in generating high-quality images with overlapping entities and handling multi-class scenarios. HAIG-2.9M was validated for its annotation quality and diversity.

Conclusion: UniMC and HAIG-2.9M together address the challenges in current keypoint-guided image generation methods, enabling more accurate and general multi-class non-rigid object generation.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FairHuman, a multi-objective training method to improve global and local quality in human image generation, especially for faces and hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating detailed human image regions like faces or hands, which are currently lacking sufficient supervision during model training.

Method: Developed FairHuman with three learning objectives: one global (default diffusion objective) and two local (hands and faces) based on positional priors, optimized using the Minimum Potential Delay criterion for fairness.

Result: FairHuman significantly improves challenging local details in generative human images without compromising overall image quality, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FairHuman proves effective for local and global improvements in human image generation, addressing historical challenges with precise details in critical regions.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

*M√©lanie Gaillochet,Mehrdad Noori,Sahar Dastani,Christian Desrosiers,Herv√© Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a weakly supervised framework for medical segmentation using bounding box annotations to generate automated prompts for foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining pixel-wise annotations for medical images is laborious and expensive. There is a need for efficient methods to reduce the annotation effort while achieving high segmentation accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that utilizes bounding box annotations to automate prompt generation for foundation vision models. The optimization scheme integrates constraints from box annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the foundation model.

Result: Achieved an average Dice score of 84.90% across multimodal datasets, surpassing existing fully and weakly supervised techniques.

Conclusion: This framework effectively leverages foundation models with weakly supervised annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing annotation requirements.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

*Alex Colagrande,Paul Caillon,Eva Feillet,Alexandre Allauzen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MANO, a Transformer model with linear complexity that delivers competitive performance on image classification and physics simulations while saving memory and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiency of standard Transformers, which exhibit quadratic complexity in memory and runtime, making them unsuitable for handling high-resolution inputs.

Method: The authors propose the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), which models attention as a distance-based interaction between grid points, ensuring a multiscale approach and achieving linear complexity.

Result: MANO demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art models like ViT and Swin Transformer on tasks such as image classification and Darcy flows, while significantly reducing runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: MANO offers a scalable, efficient, and high-performing alternative to conventional Transformers, providing a solution to the challenges of high-resolution input processing.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

*Mingxin Liu,Peiyuan Zhang,Yuan Liu,Wei Zhang,Yue Zhou,Ning Liao,Ziyang Gong,Junwei Luo,Zhirui Wang,Yi Yu,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework addressing the high dataset annotation costs in oriented object detection by employing partially weak annotations and a novel training model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and inefficiencies in dataset annotation for oriented object detection hinder broader applicability and research advancement.

Method: The proposed Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework leverages large unlabeled data and introduces OS-Student and CPF strategies for improved learning.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PWOOD achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: The PWOOD framework lowers annotation costs while maintaining or enhancing detection performance, contributing to cost-effective oriented object detection.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

*Danrong Zhang,Huili Huang,N. Simrill Smith,Nimisha Roy,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for assessing earthquake damage in social media images using semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing damage from post-earthquake social media images are subjective and fail to capture detailed damage levels.

Method: The study used semantic segmentation with a segmented damage severity dataset and fine-tuned a SegFormer model for analysis.

Result: A new damage severity scoring system quantifies damage more precisely by incorporating depth estimation and varying damage levels.

Conclusion: This approach enables objective and detailed damage assessment, aiding disaster response teams with targeted actions.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

### [134] [RichControl: Structure- and Appearance-Rich Training-Free Spatial Control for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02792)
*Liheng Zhang,Lexi Pang,Hang Ye,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature injection framework for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models that aims to enhance spatial control and eliminate artifacts without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models, while successful, need methods to handle spatial control effectively and avoid artifacts like misalignment or leakage, especially with non-RGB conditional images.

Method: The framework uses a structure-rich injection module to decouple the feature injection timestep from the denoising process. It also includes appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conditioning scenarios, offering improved structural fidelity and visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables training-free, high-quality generation with balanced control over structure and appearance, addressing limitations in synchronous feature injection methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

*Miguel Espinosa,Chenhongyi Yang,Linus Ericsson,Steven McDonagh,Elliot J. Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for object segmentation using a small set of reference images, bypassing the need for manual prompts or complex rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in image segmentation models, which require costly annotated datasets or manual visual prompts, by exploring object segmentation with minimal reference images.

Method: The method involves a multi-stage, training-free approach utilizing (1) memory bank construction, (2) representation aggregation, and (3) semantic-aware feature matching to generate segmentation masks.

Result: The proposed approach achieves significant improvements in segmentation metrics, attaining state-of-the-art performance on datasets like COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50), and outperforms training-free methods on Cross-Domain FSOD (22.4% nAP).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of leveraging foundation models and semantic priors for reference-based image segmentation, reducing manual interventions and enhancing performance.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. B√ºhler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperGaussians are introduced as an advanced form of 3D Gaussian Splatting to create high-quality, animatable face avatars from videos, addressing challenges like nonlinear deformations, lighting effects, and fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The creation of detailed and animatable face avatars from videos is challenging and has significant applications in augmented and virtual reality, requiring solutions beyond static faces and current monocular video techniques.

Method: HyperGaussians extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to high-dimensional multivariate representation with enhanced expressivity, combined with an 'inverse covariance trick' to address computational limitations and enable easy integration into models.

Result: HyperGaussians integrated into FlashAvatar outperform 3D Gaussian Splatting, demonstrating superior numerical and visual results for facial details and complex movements.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians offer a significant advancement in animatable face avatars, overcoming limitations of 3DGS and enabling more realistic representations and animations.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

TL;DR: LangScene-X introduces a generative framework for reconstructing and understanding 3D scenes with sparse 2D views, overcoming limitations of traditional methods reliant on dense-view reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of recovering 3D structures with scene understanding from limited 2D views, particularly resolving issues with rendering artifacts and semantic inaccuracies in prior methods.

Method: The paper proposes a TriMap video diffusion model for generating consistent multi-modality inputs and employs a Language Quantized Compressor for efficient language embedding encoding. Language surface fields are reconstructed for scene comprehension.

Result: LangScene-X demonstrates improved quality and generalizability in 3D scene reconstruction and understanding from sparse views, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LangScene-X enables accurate generation and comprehension of 3D scenes with minimal views, leveraging generative models and language embeddings for innovative advancements in scene reconstruction technology.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR) aimed at improving multimodal human activity recognition (HAR) by addressing challenges like feature alignment and modality imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal HAR systems face difficulties with cross-modal feature alignment and modality imbalance, hindering the performance of intelligent systems for perceiving human activities.

Method: The proposed DCDP-HAR framework utilizes dual-path feature extraction with ResNet and DenseNet, multi-stage contrastive learning for feature alignment, and confidence-driven gradient modulation to manage modality contributions. It employs a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy to improve training stability.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its components.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR successfully addresses the challenges of feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions, improving the performance and stability of multimodal sensor-based HAR systems.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper develops a multi-attention interaction model for human activity recognition (HAR), achieving state-of-the-art results across datasets and validating its efficiency on embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in HAR, such as limited labeled data for rare activities, inadequate high-level feature extraction, and model inefficiency on lightweight devices.

Method: Introduces a multi-component strategy combining unsupervised data augmentation (via a diffusion model), a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network with attention mechanisms, and an adaptive loss function for enhanced model optimization.

Result: Achieved competitive accuracies of 98.84% on WISDM, 93.81% on PAMAP2, and 80.92% on OPPORTUNITY datasets, consistently outperforming prior work. Demonstrated its practical efficacy on embedded devices.

Conclusion: The proposed USAD framework effectively addresses key HAR challenges, enhancing performance and adaptability, while being efficient enough to run on embedded systems.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: AnyI2V is a framework for motion-controlled video generation that offers greater flexibility than existing methods, without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in current text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) systems like poor spatial control, reliance on real images, and computational overhead.

Method: The authors present 'AnyI2V,' a training-free framework that animates conditional inputs (e.g., images, meshes, and point clouds) with user-defined motion trajectories and mixed conditioning inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate AnyI2V's superior performance in motion and spatial control, with additional capabilities like style transfer and content editing.

Conclusion: AnyI2V broadens the scope of video generation by enabling flexible and versatile input modalities and motion trajectories, offering a new perspective in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

*Jiaer Xia,Bingkui Tong,Yuhang Zang,Rui Shao,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a method to adapt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for specialized vision tasks using limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models struggle to perform well on specialized vision tasks like chart understanding due to a mismatch between pre-training datasets (focused on scenes and objects) and downstream tasks involving non-object images.

Method: The researchers propose GCoT, which injects grounding information (bounding boxes) into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data to reduce factual errors and better align reasoning steps with input images. This method uses a bootstrapping approach.

Result: The GCoT method outperforms standard fine-tuning and distillation in five specialized vision tasks, especially in data-limited scenarios. The tasks include diverse visual formats such as charts, tables, receipts, and reports.

Conclusion: GCoT successfully boosts the performance of MLLMs on specialized vision tasks by leveraging grounding-enhanced CoT reasoning data, offering a more effective adaptation strategy under limited data conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in inference speed and high computational costs in video generation models, which limit their broader application in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a training-free caching framework, EasyCache, that reuses previously computed transformation vectors dynamically during runtime without requiring offline profiling or parameter tuning.

Result: EasyCache achieves acceleration improvements of 2.1-3.3x in inference speed while maintaining high visual fidelity, with up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EasyCache offers an efficient and accessible solution that significantly improves the performance of video generation models for both research and practical applications without compromising on quality.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Result: LiteReality achieves state-of-the-art performance in object retrieval and material painting, demonstrating robustness under challenging conditions such as misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting.

Conclusion: LiteReality is effective and versatile in generating compact, editable, and interactive 3D scenes suitable for a range of applications, showcasing advancements in rendering and simulation.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

### [144] [RefTok: Reference-Based Tokenization for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02862)
*Xiang Fan,Xiaohang Sun,Kushan Thakkar,Zhu Liu,Vimal Bhat,Ranjay Krishna,Xiang Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RefTok, a reference-based tokenization method for video modeling that addresses temporal redundancy and significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing video models struggle to handle temporal redundancy, as they often fail to effectively capture temporal dependencies and redundancies in video data.

Method: RefTok uses a reference-based tokenization method, encoding and decoding sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame to capture temporal dynamics and preserve motion and object appearance continuity.

Result: RefTok outperformed state-of-the-art tokenizers by an average of 36.7% on all evaluated metrics and improved video generation performance, surpassing even larger models with 4x more parameters.

Conclusion: RefTok effectively addresses temporal redundancy in video modeling, delivering significant performance improvements in compression, reconstruction, and video generation.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

*Yuqi Wu,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point3R introduces an explicit spatial pointer memory structure for dense 3D scene reconstruction, addressing limitations in implicit memory methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene reconstruction struggle with memory capacity and information loss when processing image sequences, especially in practical applications.

Method: Point3R uses a novel explicit spatial pointer memory that directly associates with the 3D scene structure, employing position embedding and a fusion mechanism for efficient scene integration.

Result: Point3R achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on dense 3D reconstruction tasks with reduced training cost.

Conclusion: The paper presents Point3R as an effective online framework for dense 3D reconstruction, overcoming prior limitations with new methodological innovations. The implementation is available for further exploration.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

### [147] [Signalling Health for Improved Kubernetes Microservice Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02158)
*Jacob Roberts,Blair Archibald,Phil Trinder*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces and evaluates a Signal-based Container Monitoring (SCM) approach for Kubernetes, showing faster fault detection and higher service availability than the typical Poll-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations of Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), which requires tuning, may delay fault detection, and risks service availability in crucial applications.

Method: The authors designed, implemented, and empirically tested SCM within Kubernetes using a mathematical model. They conducted six experiments comparing SCM and PCM using the SockShop benchmark.

Result: SCM detects container failure 86% faster than PCM, achieves comparable readiness detection time, and avoids erroneous fault detection, which reduces PCM's service availability by 4%.

Conclusion: SCM provides significant advantages over PCM, including better failure detection without tuning or errors, and the authors suggest that container orchestrators should implement SCM features.

Abstract: Microservices are often deployed and managed by a container orchestrator that
can detect and fix failures to maintain the service availability critical in
many applications. In Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), the orchestrator
periodically checks container health. While a common approach, PCM requires
careful tuning, may degrade service availability, and can be slow to detect
container health changes. An alternative is Signal-based Container Monitoring
(SCM), where the container signals the orchestrator when its status changes. We
present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for
Kubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by
a new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM
over six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that
polling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\% faster than
PCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource
overheads. We find PCM can erroneously detect failures, and this reduces
service availability by 4\%. We propose that orchestrators offer SCM features
for faster failure detection than PCM without erroneous detections or careful
tuning.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transfer learning approach to identify fault root causes in complex cloud computing systems, achieving high performance even under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity, dense service coupling, and limited fault information in cloud environments create challenges for identifying fault root causes accurately.

Method: An intelligent transfer learning-based algorithm is presented, incorporating shared feature extraction, domain adversarial mechanisms, and a pseudo-label selection strategy to improve adaptability and generalization even with limited labeled data.

Result: Experimental results show superior model performance in accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC compared to existing approaches, while demonstrating robustness under class imbalance and structural heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses fault identification challenges in cloud systems, showcasing strong discriminative ability and practical application in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fault root cause identification in
cloud computing environments. The difficulty arises from complex system
structures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information. To solve
this problem, an intelligent identification algorithm based on transfer
learning is proposed. The method introduces a shared feature extraction module
and a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from
the source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's
discriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The
model incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are
lacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.
This enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate
the stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,
experiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class
imbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key
metrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger
discriminative power and robustness. Notably, under extreme class imbalance and
significant structural differences in the target domain, the model still
maintains high performance. This validates the effectiveness and practical
value of the proposed mechanisms in complex cloud computing systems.

### [149] [Flotilla: A scalable, modular and resilient federated learning framework for heterogeneous resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02295)
*Roopkatha Banerjee,Prince Modi,Jinal Vyas,Chunduru Sri Abhijit,Tejus Chandrashekar,Harsha Varun Marisetty,Manik Gupta,Yogesh Simmhan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flotilla, a lightweight and scalable federated learning (FL) framework designed for real-world distributed setups with features like asynchronous aggregation and fault tolerance, outperforming existing frameworks in scalability and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning frameworks mainly focus on pseudo-distributed simulations, neglecting real-world distributed deployments and systems-level evaluations. They also lack robust support for asynchronous aggregation and resilience to system failures.

Method: Flotilla is designed with a modular architecture that adopts stateless clients, separates server session state, and leverages checkpointing for fault tolerance. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies and is agnostic to DNN architectures.

Result: The researchers evaluated Flotilla with five FL strategies and DNN models, tested its fault tolerance on over 200 clients, and compared its resource usage and scalability against frameworks like Flower, OpenFL, and FedML. Flotilla demonstrated comparable or superior resource efficiency and better scalability, particularly for setups with 1000+ clients.

Conclusion: Flotilla emerges as a strong candidate for developing, deploying, and evaluating novel FL strategies, surpassing other FL frameworks in modularity, fault tolerance, resource efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: With the recent improvements in mobile and edge computing and rising concerns
of data privacy, Federated Learning(FL) has rapidly gained popularity as a
privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning methodology. Several FL
frameworks have been built for testing novel FL strategies. However, most focus
on validating the learning aspects of FL through pseudo-distributed simulation
but not for deploying on real edge hardware in a distributed manner to
meaningfully evaluate the federated aspects from a systems perspective. Current
frameworks are also inherently not designed to support asynchronous
aggregation, which is gaining popularity, and have limited resilience to client
and server failures. We introduce Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight FL
framework. It adopts a ``user-first'' modular design to help rapidly compose
various synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies while being agnostic to the
DNN architecture. It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates
out the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We
demonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL
strategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and
server-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to
rapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource
usage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or
better than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML. It
also scales significantly better compared to Flower for 1000+ clients. This
positions Flotilla as a competitive candidate to build novel FL strategies on,
compare them uniformly, rapidly deploy them, and perform systems research and
optimizations.

Abstract: The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) has a long-standing tradition
of delivering top-tier high-performance computing systems, exemplified by the
Piz Daint supercomputer. However, the increasing diversity of scientific needs
has exposed limitations in traditional vertically integrated HPC architectures,
which often lack flexibility and composability. To address these challenges,
CSCS developed Alps, a next-generation HPC infrastructure designed with a
transformative principle: resources operate as independent endpoints within a
high-speed network. This architecture enables the creation of independent
tenant-specific and platform-specific services, tailored to diverse scientific
requirements.
  Alps incorporates heterogeneous hardware, including CPUs and GPUs,
interconnected by a high-performance Slingshot network, and offers a modular
storage system. A key innovation is the versatile software-defined cluster
(vCluster) technology, which bridges cloud and HPC paradigms. By abstracting
infrastructure, service management, and user environments into distinct layers,
vClusters allow for customized platforms that support diverse workloads.
Current platforms on Alps serve various scientific domains, including numerical
weather prediction, and AI research.

*Xing Liu,Lizhuo Luo,Ming Tang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlowSpec is a framework designed to improve distributed inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) at the network edge by enhancing pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address latency inefficiencies in distributed inference for large language models at the network edge, especially under sparse utilization conditions.

Method: FlowSpec employs pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding with three mechanisms: score-based step-wise verification, efficient draft management, and dynamic draft expansion strategies.

Result: Experimental tests showed FlowSpec enhances inference speeds for various models, with speedup ratios ranging from 1.36√ó to 1.77√ó compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: FlowSpec effectively reduces inference latency for distributed LLMs at the network edge, proving itself as an efficient solution to improve pipeline utilization and decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: LDSolver is a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver designed for efficient fluid flow simulation on coarse grids, improving accuracy and generalizability over classical solvers and machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address computational inefficiencies and limitations in interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency of classical numerical solvers and machine learning models in fluid flow simulation.

Method: The proposed LDSolver combines a differentiable finite volume solver with a learnable module that approximates fluxes and corrects temporal errors on coarse grids, requiring minimal training data.

Result: LDSolver demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various flow systems, achieving high accuracy, improved generalizability, and reduced computational costs compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: LDSolver offers an efficient and accurate solution for fluid flow simulation, balancing the trade-offs of classical solvers and machine learning approaches, making it a promising tool for applications across meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DKGCM, a graph convolutional network, for improved spatiotemporal traffic demand forecasting using clustering, FFT integration, and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic demand forecasting models face limitations in capturing complex spatiotemporal relationships, hindering their accuracy.

Method: The proposed DK-GCN uses Dynamic Time Warping and K-means clustering for spatial dependencies, integrates Fast Fourier Transform for temporal patterns, and employs GRPO reinforcement learning for optimizing the loss function.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets confirm that the model outperforms other advanced methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: The DKGCM model effectively addresses spatiotemporal forecasting issues, achieving superior performance and showing broad applicability.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

TL;DR: This study evaluates different multimodal feature combinations (text, images, and social features) using an early fusion approach to improve misinformation detection on social media during crises and elections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Amid the spread of misinformation during elections and crises, existing detection methods focus on unimodal approaches. Few studies explore combining multimodal features, leaving a gap in understanding their effectiveness.

Method: The study analyzed 1,529 tweets with both text and images from Twitter using early fusion of text, visual, and social features. Techniques like object detection and OCR were applied for feature enrichment. Models combined unsupervised and supervised methods.

Result: Multimodal models showed a 15% improvement in classification performance over unimodal models, and a 5% improvement over bimodal models. Propagation patterns of misinformation and user behaviors were also analyzed.

Conclusion: Combining and enriching multimodal features effectively improves misinformation detection, providing insights into propagation patterns and user dissemination behaviors.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

*Hexiang Bai,Deyu Li,Jiye Liang,Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a feature selection method for massive data, leveraging sampling techniques and rough set theory to ensure discriminatory ability while reducing computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is critical for intelligent systems to operate efficiently, especially when handling large-scale data with limited computational resources.

Method: The method measures discriminatory ability using the ratio of discernible object pairs and constructs positive region preserved samples from massive data for feature selection.

Result: Tests on 11 datasets confirmed rapid computation times for reducts and high discriminatory ability, meeting or exceeding pre-estimated boundaries.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively selects feature subsets with high discriminatory ability for massive datasets within reasonable computation time, suitable for use on personal computers.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework for anomaly detection in semiconductor manufacturing, utilizing Multi-Variate Time-Series (MTS) conversion into image-based representations and a Siamese network for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semiconductor manufacturing involves highly complex processes with challenges like high dimensionality, class imbalance, noisy data, and delayed fault emergence, creating the need for advanced anomaly detection methods.

Method: The method includes: (1) transforming MTS data into images using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT); (2) fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16 on CWT-based image datasets; (3) constructing a Siamese network with VGG-16 backbones to classify anomalies based on CWT image pairs.

Result: The proposed model shows high accuracy in detecting anomalies in real semiconductor fabrication process time-series data, providing an effective offline anomaly detection tool.

Conclusion: The approach offers a flexible and generic solution for anomaly detection in MTS data, catering to both supervised and semi-supervised settings, with potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Mathilde Caron,Alireza Fathi,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of long-video understanding by introducing "Temporal Chain of Thought"‚Äîan inference strategy that identifies and extracts the most relevant video frames for question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face difficulty in processing long videos, as they struggle with irrelevant distractions and inefficient utilization of extended context windows.

Method: The paper proposes "Temporal Chain of Thought," an iterative process where the VLM is used during inference to select and prioritize the most relevant frames for answering video-related questions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse video question-answering datasets, including significant improvements on long videos, outperforming conventional inference strategies by 2.8 points on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Allocating more computational resources at inference-time for context selection significantly enhances accuracy and resolves limitations found in standard VLM approaches, particularly for long video understanding.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning approach to improve cross-subject motor imagery classification in brain-computer interfaces, focusing on optimized preprocessing of EEG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of significant variability in EEG patterns across individuals, which lowers classification accuracy and hinders the development of calibration-free BCIs for real-world applications.

Method: The method involves using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data with optimized parameters, a balanced batching strategy, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach was validated across four different datasets.

Result: The method achieved significant performance improvements: 67.60% accuracy on BCI Competition IV Dataset 1, 65.96% on Dataset 2A, and 80.22% on Dataset 2B, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The results set new benchmarks for generalizable, calibration-free motor imagery classification and contribute an open-access dataset to aid further research.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

*Shakya Jayakody,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AIRES, a co-design solution improving out-of-core sparse matrix multiplications in GCNs, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing out-of-core SpGEMM solutions for GCNs face challenges like high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization due to issues in sparse format data alignment and memory allocation.

Method: AIRES introduces block-level data alignment and tiling algorithms for sparse matrices on the algorithm side, along with a three-phase dynamic scheduling mechanism featuring a dual-way data transfer strategy across GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage, and host memory.

Result: AIRES achieves up to 1.8x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art methods in real-world graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively addresses the performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, offering a significant improvement in speed and efficiency.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

*Wanjia Zhao,Jiaqi Han,Siyi Gu,Mingjian Jiang,James Zou,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoAda, a framework for fine-tuning geometric diffusion models while maintaining their original efficiency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning geometric diffusion models for tasks with varying geometric controls in an efficient and flexible way remains a challenge.

Method: GeoAda is an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework that uses coupling and decoupling operators with lightweight, trainable modules, preserving geometric consistency and preventing overfitting.

Result: Empirically, GeoAda outperforms baselines in multiple geometric control tasks and domains, maintaining performance on original tasks while avoiding overfitting.

Conclusion: GeoAda enables state-of-the-art fine-tuning for various geometrically controlled generative tasks without degrading the original model's capabilities or generalization properties.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

### [161] [Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear Constrained MDPs with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02089)
*Xingtu Liu,Lin F. Yang,Sharan Vaswani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with a primal-dual framework using black-box solvers, providing sample complexity bounds for relaxed and strict feasibility cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle CMDPs efficiently by leveraging existing MDP solvers, providing guidelines to address constraints in long-term reward optimization.

Method: The proposed primal-dual framework utilizes mirror descent value iteration (MDVI) and generative models to solve CMDPs under relaxed and strict feasibility paradigms.

Result: In relaxed feasibility, the algorithm achieves $\epsilon$-optimal performance with $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. Under strict feasibility, performance requires $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples, depending on the Slater constant.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently handles CMDPs, demonstrating near-optimal sample complexity performance in both relaxed and strict feasibility cases and extending to tabular CMDPs.

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

*Eitan Anzenberg,Arunava Samajpati,Sivasankaran Chandrasekar,Varun Kacholia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and a domain-specific AI model (Match Score) for hiring, highlighting the superior accuracy and fairness of Match Score compared to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well LLMs perform in candidate screening tasks and investigate algorithmic biases and fairness issues in hiring.

Method: The study benchmarks LLMs against the proprietary Match Score model, focusing on predictive accuracy metrics (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness metrics (impact ratio across demographic groups).

Result: Match Score achieved better accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77 for best LLMs) and fairness (minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957 vs 0.809 for LLMs) in job candidate matching tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific AI models like Match Score are more effective in achieving both accuracy and fairness for hiring tasks, emphasizing the need for bias auditing and caution when using off-the-shelf LLMs.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores refining autoregressive models for constrained text generation by employing self-distillation to improve alignment with target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained text generation often struggles when target outputs are unlikely according to the base model due to sparse and uninformative reward signals.

Method: They propose iteratively refining the base language model through self-distillation to better align it with the desired target distributions.

Result: The proposed approach leads to significant improvements in the quality of generated text under constrained settings.

Conclusion: Self-distillation effectively alleviates learning challenges in constrained text generation, resulting in better model performance.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), an unsupervised learning approach for generalizing System 2 Thinking across modalities and tasks, achieving notable improvements in model scaling, inference performance, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether System 2 Thinking can be generalized and implemented via unsupervised learning to overcome modality and problem-specific limitations in current approaches.

Method: Develop and train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) as a novel Energy-Based Model to assign energy values for input and candidate-prediction pairs, enabling predictions via gradient descent for energy minimization.

Result: EBTs outperform Transformer++ in scaling rate by up to 35%, improve System 2 Thinking-based inference performance by 29%, and exceed Diffusion Transformers for image denoising with fewer forward passes. They also surpass existing models in downstream tasks despite similar or worse pretraining.

Conclusion: EBTs represent a new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models, demonstrating robust generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks and modalities.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

### [165] [Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496)
*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies conformal prediction in an online framework, aiming for both accurate coverage and efficient interval size, with key results showing gaps between exchangeable and arbitrary data sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to optimize conformal prediction algorithms for real-time scenarios, balancing prediction accuracy (coverage) and interval efficiency (minimal length).

Method: The authors develop algorithms addressing both exchangeable and arbitrary data sequences, analyze their performance, and establish tradeoffs, including achieving Pareto-optimal settings.

Result: They demonstrate that efficient and accurate intervals can be constructed for exchangeable sequences, while arbitrary sequences lead to unavoidable tradeoffs in mistakes and efficiency.

Conclusion: No single algorithm performs optimally for both data settings; however, the introduced algorithms provide near-optimal tradeoffs, extending robustness and applicability in online prediction scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores universal scaling laws governing neural network training across model sizes and training durations, finding a tight collapse of normalized loss curves, termed 'supercollapse.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the universal principles and limits in neural network training dynamics as both model size and training time increase simultaneously.

Method: The authors analyze training dynamics by normalizing compute and loss curves for models of varying sizes and examine the phenomenon termed 'supercollapse' across architectures, datasets, and learning schedules; they further connect this to neural scaling laws and SGD noise dynamics.

Result: The paper demonstrates that normalized loss curves align tightly across models under optimal hyperparameter scaling, achieving 'supercollapse.' This universality breaks under suboptimal scaling.

Conclusion: The study provides both a theoretical framework and practical insights into neural network scaling behavior, offering precise indicators for optimal scaling during training.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for classification by finding a hyperplane within a bounded N-dimensional hypercube using an entropy-based function, extending to polynomial separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance traditional classification approaches, like perceptrons, SVMs, and gradient descent, by introducing a method that handles both linear and complex decision boundaries.

Method: The proposed method optimizes an entropy-based function on a bounded N-dimensional hypercube and introduces polynomial surfaces for complex separations.

Result: The method is demonstrated through numerical experiments, showcasing its efficiency and ability to handle both linearly and non-linearly separable data.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust alternative to existing classification methods, with versatility in solving diverse tasks.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

Motivation: EDA for VLSI design optimization faces challenges due to the massive parameter space and reliance on laborious expert-driven manual parameter tuning.

Method: CROP uses a scalable representation of RTL source code, embedding-based retrieval for semantically similar designs, and a retrieval-augmented LLM to guide parameter search based on prior design knowledge.

Result: CROP achieves better quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing techniques, including a 9.9% reduction in power consumption on industrial designs.

Conclusion: CROP showcases the potential of integrating LLMs and retrieval systems to automate and improve the efficiency of the VLSI design flow, addressing the limitations of traditional manual methods.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in contextual online pricing wherein offline data is biased, affecting the efficiency of decision-making in real-time pricing.

Method: The authors analyze statistical complexities using specific instance-dependent measures like $\delta^2$ and introduce a generalized Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) approach to achieve minimax-optimal regret bounds across different price elasticity scenarios.

Result: The study establishes tight regret guarantees for both scalar and general price elasticity cases, even when the bias bound $V$ is unknown. The proposed methodologies also apply to stochastic linear bandits.

Conclusion: This research offers a robust framework for online pricing in the presence of biased data, demonstrating both theoretical advances and practical adaptability to related problems like stochastic linear bandits.

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

*Xiao Li,Liangji Zhu,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a latent diffusion framework combining variational autoencoders and conditional diffusion models for efficient data compression with high reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of generative models in controllability and reconstruction accuracy for practical data compression applications.

Method: Combine a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model, compress a few keyframes as latent spaces, and reconstruct remaining frames using generative interpolation.

Result: Achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios than rule-based compressors and 63% better performance than learning-based methods under comparable reconstruction error.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers high compression efficacy and accurate spatiotemporal reconstruction, pushing boundaries in data compression technologies.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Tuo Wang,Jian Kang,Yujun Yan,Adithya Kulkarni,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCPNET is a novel framework for conformal prediction in temporal graphs, effectively addressing challenges posed by violations of exchangeability assumptions due to temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face challenges in quantifying uncertainty in dynamic, real-world graphs where temporal dependencies violate key assumptions, creating reliability issues in critical applications.

Method: NCPNET introduces a diffusion-based non-conformity score to handle topological and temporal uncertainties, paired with an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm to enhance computational efficiency and reduce coverage violations.

Result: NCPNET ensures statistically guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, reducing prediction set sizes by up to 31% on the WIKI dataset and outperforming state-of-the-art methodologies.

Conclusion: The proposed NCPNET framework effectively quantifies uncertainty in dynamic graphs, improving GNN reliability and efficiency, and offers advancements in handling evolving real-world data structures.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal validation procedure for analyzing a machine-learning model's responsiveness to input changes, enhancing safety in applications like lending and hiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the safety failures arising from machine-learning models ignoring how individuals can alter their inputs in decision-making contexts.

Method: Developed a sensitivity analysis framework to estimate model responsiveness using black-box access, allowing for falsification and failure probability estimation.

Result: Proposed algorithms that create uniform samples of reachable points to validate responsiveness and demonstrated applicability in areas like recidivism prediction and content moderation.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the safety and reliability of predictions in various real-world applications by accounting for model responsiveness to feature interventions.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

### [174] [Metric Design != Metric Behavior: Improving Metric Selection for the Unbiased Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02225)
*Jiyeon Bae,Hyeon Jeon,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new workflow to reduce evaluation bias in dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques by clustering highly correlated metrics and selecting representative ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metric correlation may introduce bias in evaluating DR techniques, favoring certain structural characteristics unnecessarily.

Method: The method involves calculating pairwise metric correlations, clustering metrics based on empirical similarity, and choosing representative metrics from clusters.

Result: Quantitative experiments validate the workflow by showing enhanced stability in DR evaluation.

Conclusion: The workflow effectively mitigates evaluation bias, improving the reliability of DR projection assessments.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

*Xinquan Huang,Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a training-free correction framework that enhances stability in neural network surrogates for PDEs by addressing error accumulation during long-term rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of error accumulation in neural network models when used as surrogates for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). This error accumulation leads to significant deviations from physically valid solutions during long-term rollouts.

Method: PhysicsCorrect employs a training-free correction framework where consistency with PDEs is achieved at every prediction step. The method formulates this correction as a linearized inverse problem using PDE residuals and introduces an efficient caching strategy to precompute the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse, significantly reducing computational overhead.

Result: PhysicsCorrect achieves up to 100x reduction in prediction errors while maintaining negligible inference time (under 5%). The framework has been validated across Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, ensuring improved accuracy across diverse PDE systems.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that neural surrogates for PDEs can be made both computationally efficient and physically accurate through PhysicsCorrect, providing a reliable simulation approach for scientific applications.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

### [176] [VERBA: Verbalizing Model Differences Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02241)
*Shravan Doda,Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VERBA, a large language model solution for verbalizing differences between machine learning models, addressing the challenge of comparing numerous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of trained machine learning models exhibiting similar performance but differing behavior has made it difficult for users to compare and understand these models, creating a need for automated documentation.

Method: The authors developed VERBA, which uses a large language model to sample and verbalize model behavioral differences, and evaluated the informativeness of these verbalizations through simulations and benchmarks.

Result: Results showed that VERBA achieved up to 80% accuracy in verbalizing differences between models, which increased to 90% when incorporating structural model information.

Conclusion: VERBA provides a mechanism to improve model transparency and comparability, opening new post-hoc research opportunities for analyzing machine learning models.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based framework, to optimize coupon strategies in ride-hailing services amid competitive pricing, leveraging RideGym for testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competitive ranking mechanism on ride-hailing platforms incentivizes providers to lower prices using coupons, creating a need for adaptive and budget-aware subsidy strategies.

Method: The approach integrates Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) for dynamic pricing response and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA) for budget compliance, tested via the RideGym simulation.

Result: Experimental results show FCA-RL consistently surpasses baseline methods in handling various market conditions for coupon subsidy optimization.

Conclusion: FCA-RL enables effective and sustainable coupon strategies, addressing competitive pricing challenges while adhering to financial constraints, benefiting ride-hailing providers.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces URDP, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) and uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization to enhance reward function design in RL and achieve better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective reward functions for reinforcement learning is hindered by the inefficiencies and inconsistencies of conventional methodologies.

Method: The proposed URDP framework combines LLM-based logic reasoning, uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization. It uses self-consistency analysis to identify and optimize reward components, adopting a bi-level optimization strategy.

Result: URDP demonstrated superior reward quality and improved efficiency in automated reward design across 35 tasks in three benchmark environments.

Conclusion: URDP effectively streamlines reward function design, reduces computational overhead, and enhances reward quality and design efficiency in RL environments.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

*Zhaoyu Zhang,Lingyi Wang,Wei Wu,Fuhui Zhou,Qihui Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication framework to overcome limitations in generalization and interpretability of existing models, especially with unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic communication approaches lack interpretability and generalization, particularly when encountering unseen data.

Method: The method uses a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base to align semantic features, reduce communication overhead by transmitting compact semantics, and employs zero-shot learning at the receiver for unseen data classification without retraining.

Result: Experiments on APY datasets demonstrate superior generalization and classification performance for unseen categories, under various SNR levels, compared to existing semantic communication frameworks.

Conclusion: This novel framework enhances communication adaptability and efficiency while addressing key interpretability and generalization challenges in semantic communication.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

### [180] [Holistic Continual Learning under Concept Drift with Adaptive Memory Realignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02310)
*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMR proposes a lightweight mechanism for continual learning in dynamic environments, addressing concept drift by selectively updating memory, and achieves performance comparable to full retraining but with significantly lower computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning methods assume static data distributions and largely focus on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, missing the challenge posed by concept drift in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR), which selectively removes and replenishes samples in memory buffers to adapt to distribution shifts, and compare it with Full Relearning as a baseline.

Result: AMR matches the performance of Full Relearning while drastically reducing labeled data and computational requirements. The framework is tested on new concept-drift adapted benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMR emerges as a scalable and effective solution for continual learning under concept drift, promoting balance between stability and adaptability in dynamic data environments.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeltaSHAP, a new explainable AI algorithm tailored for real-time clinical time series explanation, outperforming existing XAI methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing XAI methods do not adequately address the critical need in clinical systems to explain how patient risk predictions evolve over time, crucial for timely medical interventions.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values for temporal data to explain prediction changes based on observed feature combinations and new evaluation metrics for attribution faithfulness.

Result: DeltaSHAP performs better than state-of-the-art XAI methods, showing 62% improved explanation quality and 33% reduced computation time on the MIMIC-III benchmark.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP is an efficient, practical, and accurate XAI solution for real-time clinical patient monitoring, addressing critical gaps in current methods.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether computationally expensive diffusion models are necessary for offline RL improvement and explore simpler alternatives.

Method: Introduced Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI) using noise-injected actions and penalization based on noise levels. Provided theoretical foundation via modified noisy action MDP.

Result: Significant performance improvement across benchmarks when combined with existing offline RL algorithms.

Conclusion: PANI offers a computationally simpler way to achieve improvements in offline RL, broadening compatibility and demonstrating effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using preference optimization, this paper improves the consistency of trajectory predictions among agents in multi-agent settings while maintaining accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicle safety. Current models struggle with interdependencies in complex, interactive scenarios.

Method: The authors fine-tuned state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models using preference rankings calculated automatically for multi-agent scenarios.

Result: Experimental results across three datasets show significant enhancement in scene consistency with minimal trade-offs in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that preference optimization is effective in improving consistency in multi-agent trajectory predictions without increasing computational costs.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2FGL, a framework to enhance Federated Graph Learning (FGL) by addressing structural and spectral issues within subgraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of Federated Graph Learning by resolving spatial and spectral challenges such as edge disconnections and spectral heterogeneity affecting global generalizability.

Method: The proposed method includes implementing a global knowledge repository to address spatial disruptions and a frequency alignment mechanism to mitigate spectral client drifts.

Result: S2FGL framework demonstrates superior effectiveness through extensive experiments conducted on various datasets.

Conclusion: The S2FGL framework successfully mitigates spatial and spectral challenges in FGL, enhancing both signal propagation and global generalizability across subgraphs.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

### [187] [Variational Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02466)
*Francesco Alesiani,Henrik Christiansen,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, are modified into "InfinityKAN" where the number of basis functions is adaptively learned during training using variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in KANs that require an ad-hoc choice of the number of univariate function bases, making it less flexible for learning representations compared to standard architectures like MLPs.

Method: The authors propose InfinityKAN, which uses variational inference to adaptively learn an infinite number of basis functions during training, integrated into the backpropagation process.

Result: InfinityKAN eliminates the need for manually choosing the number of bases, making it more flexible and practical as a machine learning model.

Conclusion: By adaptively learning the number of bases, InfinityKAN broadens the applicability of KANs and improves their practicality for representation learning tasks, addressing a major architectural challenge.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

*Chenxu Wang,Yilin Lyu,Zicheng Sun,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GORP, a novel training strategy combining full and low-rank parameters for continual learning, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models is limited by the trade-off between efficiency and the ability to learn/transfer knowledge, particularly with methods like LoRA.

Method: The GORP method integrates full and low-rank parameters, jointly updating them in a unified low-rank gradient subspace to optimize continual learning while maintaining efficiency.

Result: GORP achieves superior performance on various continual learning benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: GORP succeeds in balancing efficiency and learning expressiveness, providing an effective solution to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

### [189] [RetrySQL: text-to-SQL training with retry data for self-correcting query generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02529)
*Alicja RƒÖczkowska,Riccardo Belluzzo,Piotr Zieli≈Ñski,Joanna Baran,Pawe≈Ç Olszewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetrySQL introduces a self-correcting training approach for text-to-SQL models, significantly improving execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address deficiencies in current text-to-SQL models, such as lack of SQL-specific generative strategies and unexplored self-correcting generation techniques.

Method: The authors introduce RetrySQL, a technique that involves corrupting reasoning steps for SQL queries to create retry data with incorrect and corrected steps, and pre-train coding models using this data.

Result: RetrySQL achieves up to 4 percentage point improvements in execution accuracy and demonstrates self-correction capabilities, surpassing fine-tuning approaches like LoRA.

Conclusion: RetrySQL-trained models provide competitive accuracy compared to proprietary models with far fewer parameters, validating self-correction as an effective method for improving SQL generation.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

### [190] [Position: A Theory of Deep Learning Must Include Compositional Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02550)
*David A. Danhofer,Davide D'Ascenzo,Rafael Dubach,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses the role of compositional sparsity in explaining the success of overparametrized deep neural networks (DNNs) and highlights open theoretical questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have achieved great success, but foundational principles governing their learning dynamics remain unclear. Understanding these principles could bridge existing theoretical gaps.

Method: The paper focuses on compositional sparsity, arguing that DNNs succeed because they exploit the structure of functions composed of small, low-dimensional subsets of inputs. The argument is extended to efficiently Turing-computable functions.

Result: The paper shows that compositional sparsity applies to most practical functions and outlines its theoretical implications for DNN approximation and generalization.

Conclusion: Understanding and completing the theoretical picture of compositional sparsity is necessary for advancing deep learning and broader theories of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

### [191] [Transformers Don't Need LayerNorm at Inference Time: Scaling LayerNorm Removal to GPT-2 XL and the Implications for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02559)
*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Layer-wise Normalization (LN) layers can be removed from GPT-2 models with minimal impact on performance, improving model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of Layer-wise Normalization (LN) layers during inference and to enhance mechanistic interpretability by reducing model nonlinearities and interconnections.

Method: The researchers removed LN layers from GPT-2 models, evaluated the impact on validation loss and fine-tuning data requirements, and tested interpretability techniques on the modified models.

Result: Removing all LN layers led to a marginal increase in validation loss (e.g., +0.03 cross-entropy for GPT-2 XL). The amount of data needed for fine-tuning scaled sublinearly with model size. LN-free models were also found to improve interpretability by enabling precise attribution measurements.

Conclusion: GPT-2 models can function effectively without LN layers, which do not play a significant role in language modeling. The LN-free models support enhanced interpretability research and better understanding of language models.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs), making them scalable to wider layers and reducing model size through advanced pruning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability limitations and improve resource efficiency in DBNs, especially for resource-constrained hardware.

Method: The authors introduced a scalable trainable interconnect for DBNs and two pruning methods: SAT-based logic equivalence and similarity-based data-driven pruning to optimize size and accuracy.

Result: The extended DBNs offer favorable scalability, accuracy, and effective pruning mechanisms delivering superior compression-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The advancements enable DBNs to handle wider layers efficiently while minimizing size, maintaining accuracy, and improving applicability in constrained hardware environments.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

TL;DR: This study introduces Pad√© Approximant Neural Networks (Pad√©Nets) for induction motor fault diagnosis using vibration and acoustic data, outperforming CNNs and Self-ONNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing fault diagnosis in induction motors by exploring more advanced neural network architectures compared to traditional methods.

Method: Three deep learning models‚Äî1D CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad√©Nets‚Äîwere tested on constant-speed induction motor datasets with vibration and acoustic signals.

Result: Pad√©Nets outperformed baseline models with diagnostic accuracies over 97% for vibration and acoustic sensors.

Conclusion: The Pad√©Net's enhanced nonlinearity and compatibility with unbounded activation functions significantly improve diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

*Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan,Zhaocong Yuan,Shaojie Zhuo,Chen Feng,Yicheng Lin,Chenzheng Su,Xiaopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniDraft, a framework for using a single draft model with any target model in speculative decoding, achieving dynamic adaption and increased efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in speculative decoding for on-device LLM applications, including target model incompatibility with draft models and the need for latency improvements.

Method: OmniDraft employs an online n-gram cache combined with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to handle vocabulary mismatches. The framework also uses adaptive drafting techniques to increase decoding speed.

Result: OmniDraft enables dynamic usage of a single Llama-68M model with multiple target models (Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B, Llama3-8B) and achieves decoding speedups of 1.5-2x.

Conclusion: OmniDraft demonstrates a scalable and efficient solution for speculative decoding across different target models and tasks, proving its suitability for on-device LLM applications.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores using diffusion models in the latent space for emulating dynamical systems, showing robustness in accuracy across compression rates and higher performance than non-generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational inefficiency of diffusion models used for fast physics emulation.

Method: The researchers apply diffusion models in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space and test the accuracy across various compression rates.

Result: The findings reveal remarkable robustness in accuracy up to compression rates of 1000x and superior performance of generative models compared to non-generative ones, with added diversity in predictions.

Conclusion: Latent-space diffusion models are a promising approach for efficiently emulating dynamical systems, provided key design choices are optimized.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Learnable VAE model (L-VAE) for learning a disentangled representation and hyperparameters of the cost function dynamically, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in disentanglement and reconstruction trade-offs in existing VAE approaches by dynamically learning loss term weights and hyperparameters.

Method: Proposes L-VAE, an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, that learns weights for loss terms concurrently with model parameters and includes a regularization term to prevent bias between reconstruction and disentanglement losses.

Result: L-VAE achieves top or second-best disentanglement performance across multiple datasets compared to other VAE variants and successfully disentangles features in qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: L-VAE effectively balances reconstruction fidelity and disentanglement, outperforming baseline models while demonstrating robustness across various datasets and tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a transformer-based matrix variational autoencoder (matVAE) evaluated on protein variant prediction tasks, outperforming current methods and suggesting deep mutational scanning (DMS) as a viable alternative to multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional variant effect predictors (VEPs) rely heavily on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for functional impact assessment. However, this approach struggles with pharmacogenes under low evolutionary pressure, necessitating alternative methods for effective variant prediction.

Method: The study introduces a matVAE with a structured prior, leveraging transformer architecture. The matVAE was tested on 33 DMS datasets from ProteinGym and compared against state-of-the-art models such as DeepSequence and matENC-DMS.

Result: The matVAE trained on MSAs surpassed DeepSequence in zero-shot prediction tasks, while being more computationally efficient. Furthermore, matENC-DMS excelled in supervised situations, and incorporating AlphaFold structures enhanced matVAE's performance significantly.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that DMS datasets can effectively replace MSAs for variant effect prediction with comparable accuracy. This could pave the way for expanded DMS dataset development and broader exploration of their applications in predictive variant modeling.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

TL;DR: Medical Data Pecking approach introduces a systematic method to address data quality concerns in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using unit testing and coverage concepts inspired by software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data are often incomplete or biased due to their primary design for clinical and billing purposes, yet they are increasingly used in epidemiological studies and AI training.

Method: The Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT) utilizes automated test generation with large language models and a data testing framework to identify issues in datasets.

Result: MDPT successfully detected 20-43 data issues across different datasets (All of Us, MIMIC-III, and SyntheticMass), demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing data quality problems.

Conclusion: Integrating external medical knowledge and context-sensitive testing into the data analysis process improves the validation of outcomes and sets the stage for more advanced development in data quality assurance methods.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

*David H. Mguni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical deep learning framework enabling neural networks to autonomously create, solve, and generalize tasks through recursive meta-learning and category-theoretic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learning approaches are limited by reliance on human-generated data and lack structured, hierarchical mechanisms to generalize across tasks.

Method: The framework generates synthetic tasks (virtual tasks) to guide learning, applies category-theoretic functors to establish hierarchical learning processes, and regularly refines constraints based on challenging tasks.

Result: The hierarchy improves task adaptation, enhances generalization, and introduces a compositional structure to meta-learning.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical architecture provides a unified framework for meta-learning and could advance neural networks toward achieving general artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO), a framework designed to produce effective positive samples to enhance reasoning in large language models during RL post-training, surpassing traditional expert demonstrations in challenging reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current RL-style post-training methods, which struggle in early-stage training and challenging reasoning tasks due to dependency on the model's initial ability to produce positive samples.

Method: The proposed ExPO framework generates effective positive samples by conditioning on ground-truth answers, allowing better alignment with the model's policy while ensuring higher quality than incorrect self-generated or expert-written samples.

Result: ExPO demonstrates improved reasoning and learning efficiency, surpassing expert-demonstration-based methods on benchmark tasks such as MATH level-5, especially in scenarios where the model initially faces significant difficulties.

Conclusion: ExPO effectively enhances reasoning in large language models by focusing on generating positive samples that are likely under the model's current policy and improve correct predictions, offering a robust alternative to expert demonstrations in RL post-training.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

### [201] [On Efficient Bayesian Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02639)
*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by targeting epistemic uncertainty rather than environmental noise. Proven guarantees and empirical success are highlighted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by addressing gaps in existing information-theoretic methods and leveraging epistemic uncertainty as a key exploration driver.

Method: The authors provide formal guarantees for information gain-based exploration methods, use sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels, and Deep Ensembles for tractable approximations, and introduce the Predictive Trajectory Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) framework.

Result: PTS-BE demonstrates superior performance in various environments, particularly those with sparse rewards or heavily exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretical foundation for epistemic uncertainty-driven exploration and delivers a practical, sample-efficient framework that outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

### [202] [Fair Deepfake Detectors Can Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02645)
*Harry Cheng,Ming-Hui Liu,Yangyang Guo,Tianyi Wang,Liqiang Nie,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework (DAID) addressing both generalization to unseen manipulations and demographic fairness in deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inherent conflict between generalization and demographic fairness in deepfake detection models.

Method: The DAID framework includes demographic-aware data rebalancing using inverse-propensity weighting and feature normalization, as well as demographic-agnostic feature aggregation using a novel alignment loss.

Result: DAID outperforms several state-of-the-art deepfake detectors in fairness and generalization, validated across three cross-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: By addressing the causal link between fairness and generalization, the proposed DAID framework effectively reconciles both goals, offering advancements in deepfake detection.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

### [203] [Guided Generation for Developable Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02670)
*Siqi Zhao,Joshua Moller,Porfi Quintero-Cadena,Lood van Niekerk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a computational model using guided diffusion for designing therapeutic antibodies with optimized developability traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic antibodies need to balance strong target engagement with favorable developability features like manufacturability, stability, and safety, which are critical for clinical use.

Method: The researchers used a guided discrete diffusion model trained on natural antibody chain sequences and paired it with a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module to maintain naturalness while favoring biophysically viable candidates.

Result: The model successfully mimics both natural antibody repertoires and approved therapeutic properties, with SVDD guidance significantly improving the predicted developability scores.

Conclusion: The introduced computational framework, combined with high-throughput developability assays, provides a robust iterative pipeline for designing functional and clinically viable antibodies.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Hanh Huyen My Nguyen,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new federated learning approach using Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoders (DP-CVAE) to enhance privacy preservation, scalability, and computational efficiency in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of deep learning in medical imaging is constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations. Although Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training, it faces challenges like high communication costs and limited flexibility in supporting multiple tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a method where clients collaboratively train a DP-CVAE using compact embeddings from foundation models, enabling privacy-aware global data distribution for diverse downstream tasks.

Result: The proposed DP-CVAE outperforms traditional FL classifiers in privacy, scalability, and efficiency. It also produces higher-fidelity embeddings than DP-CGAN with a significantly smaller model size.

Conclusion: The DP-CVAE approach boosts the applicability of FL in medical imaging by offering an efficient, privacy-preserving, and scalable solution while addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

### [205] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pricing in Supply Chains: Benchmarking Strategic Agent Behaviours under Realistically Simulated Market Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02698)
*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigates the use of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for dynamic pricing in supply chains, comparing algorithms MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERP systems in supply chains use static, rule-based pricing methods that ignore strategic interactions among market actors. This paper explores how MARL can address these limitations by introducing interdependent decision-making.

Method: Evaluated three MARL algorithms (MADDPG, MADQN, QMIX) against static rule-based baselines in a simulated environment using real e-commerce data and a LightGBM demand prediction model.

Result: Rule-based agents exhibited near-perfect fairness and high price stability but lacked competitive dynamics. MADQN showed aggressive behavior and low fairness, while MADDPG achieved balanced market competition with relatively high fairness and stable pricing.

Conclusion: MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviors absent in static pricing rules, potentially improving dynamic pricing strategies for supply chains.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

### [206] [Fluid Democracy in Federated Data Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02710)
*Aditya Vema Reddy Kesari,Krishna Reddy Kesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce data transfer costs in federated learning by selecting the most useful model weights using consensus-based protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce wasteful data transfer in federated learning by prioritizing useful model weights.

Method: Introduce consensus-based protocols, explore fluid democracy protocols, and propose a new protocol called viscous-retained democracy (FedVRD).

Result: The proposed protocol performs better than traditional methods under the same assumptions, minimizing costs while limiting adversarial impact.

Conclusion: Federated learning efficiency can be enhanced by leveraging dynamic, consensus-driven weight selection methods such as FedVRD, improving both performance and robustness.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

### [207] [A Forget-and-Grow Strategy for Deep Reinforcement Learning Scaling in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02712)
*Zilin Kang,Chenyuan Hu,Yu Luo,Zhecheng Yuan,Ruijie Zheng,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, Forget and Grow (FoG), aimed at tackling primacy bias in RL by adopting mechanisms inspired by neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations caused by primacy bias in reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency and generalization.

Method: Proposes two mechanisms: (1) Experience Replay Decay to reduce influence of early experiences, and (2) Network Expansion to dynamically increase neural capacity during training.

Result: FoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL algorithms across four major continuous control benchmarks involving over 40 tasks.

Conclusion: FoG effectively tackles primacy bias by integrating neuro-inspired mechanisms, leading to enhanced reinforcement learning performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

*Omri Porat,Michael Fire,Eran Ben-Elia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining spatial, temporal, and network dependencies to improve prediction of dockless e-scooter demand, achieving 27-49% accuracy improvement over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate demand prediction in dockless e-scooter services, crucial for their effective management, fleet distribution, and infrastructure planning.

Method: The study proposes a novel framework integrating spatial, temporal, and network dependencies for micromobility demand forecasting.

Result: The framework enhances prediction accuracy by 27-49% compared to existing baseline models, offering deeper understanding of urban e-scooter usage.

Conclusion: The findings support data-driven decisions for efficient fleet management, cost savings, and sustainable urban transport solutions.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

*Shiyi Liu,Buwen Liang,Yuetong Fang,Zixuan Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIPPO is a hierarchical contrastive framework designed for protein-protein interaction prediction across species, achieving state-of-the-art performance, robustness in low-data scenarios, and zero-shot transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately predicting protein-protein interactions across species, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental data, using hierarchical biological attributes and contrastive learning.

Method: HIPPO integrates hierarchical contrastive loss and multi-tiered biological representation matching using protein sequences and their hierarchical attributes. Domain and family knowledge are factored through a penalty mechanism to align learned embeddings with biological hierarchies.

Result: HIPPO delivers state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness in low-data settings, and zero-shot prediction capabilities across species without retraining.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework is pivotal for understanding conserved determinants of protein interactions, marking a significant advancement for multi-species protein function prediction, especially in imbalanced or sparse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

*Aurko Roy,Timothy Chou,Sai Surya Duvvuri,Sijia Chen,Jiecao Yu,Xiaodong Wang,Manzil Zaheer,Rohan Anil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture enhancing token efficiency compared to standard Transformers by utilizing trilinear functions in attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large language models are increasingly constrained by finite datasets rather than compute-bound limitations, necessitating architectures capable of improving token efficiency.

Method: The 2-simplicial Transformer is introduced, featuring trilinear functions in attention mechanisms alongside an efficient implementation using Triton kernels.

Result: For fixed token budgets, the 2-simplicial Transformer surpasses similarly sized dot-product Transformers in tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic. It also modifies scaling law exponents for knowledge and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The 2-simplicial Transformer provides a pathway to enhancing token efficiency in scenarios with finite data, outperforming traditional architectures in critical tasks and shifting scaling law dynamics.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

### [211] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Recurrent Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782)
*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrent models struggle with processing sequences that are much longer than their training context lengths, leading to poor "length generalization." The study introduces simple training interventions to address this problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recurrent models are efficient but often fail in length generalization due to exposure to limited state distributions during training.

Method: The authors propose increasing state coverage during training using techniques like state initialization with Gaussian noise or using the final state of another input sequence.

Result: With minimal additional training steps (0.1% of the pre-training budget), the interventions achieve robust length generalization for sequences significantly longer than the training context.

Conclusion: The study provides a simple and effective solution for improving long-sequence performance in recurrent models, addressing a key limitation in their application.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

*Thiti Suttaket,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces GRADUATE, a survival analysis model ensuring well-calibration across all subpopulations while balancing calibration and discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor calibration of survival models for minority subpopulations, which can lead to incorrect clinical decisions.

Method: GRADUATE employs constrained optimization to achieve multicalibration by balancing overall calibration and discrimination during training, with mathematical proof of feasibility and optimality.

Result: GRADUATE was empirically validated on clinical datasets, outperforming baselines and addressing their identified limitations.

Conclusion: GRADUATE ensures equitable and accurate survival analysis predictions, improving upon existing models' performance and calibration.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

TL;DR: This paper explores distribution testing in algorithmic replicability, presenting new algorithms and methodologies for testing properties of probability distributions, along with establishing near-optimal lower bounds for testing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sample complexity required for replicably testing natural properties of probability distributions and address open questions regarding optimal testing strategies.

Method: They developed new replicable algorithms for distribution testing tasks like closeness and independence and introduced a novel methodology for proving sample complexity lower bounds.

Result: The authors provided near-optimal sample complexity lower bounds for replicable uniformity and closeness testing, addressing open questions in this domain.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding of replicable distribution testing by offering innovative algorithms and methods, significantly contributing to the theoretical foundation of this field.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to reduce bias in estimating treatment effects in medicine, particularly when training data differs from inference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between structured training data and unstructured inference data, which leads to biased treatment effect estimations in clinical practice.

Method: The study formalizes inference time text confounding and proposes a framework leveraging large language models and a custom doubly robust learner to mitigate biases.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework improves accuracy and reduces bias in estimating treatment effects.

Conclusion: By addressing inference time text confounding, the framework contributes to more reliable personalized decision-making in medical applications.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MvHo-IB, a framework for enhancing fMRI data analysis by incorporating higher-order interactions (HOIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve diagnostic accuracy in machine learning for fMRI data by effectively modeling and utilizing HOIs.

Method: Introduced MvHo-IB, which integrates O-information with Renyi entropy for HOIs extraction, uses a Brain3DCNN encoder, and adopts a multi-view information bottleneck learning objective.

Result: MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark fMRI datasets and outperforms prior methods, including hypergraph-based techniques.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the importance of HOIs in fMRI analysis and offers a novel method that advances diagnostic decision-making.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically

### [216] [Quality Diversity Genetic Programming for Learning Scheduling Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02235)
*Meng Xu,Frank Neumann,Aneta Neumann,Yew Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization framework tailored for dynamic scheduling problems, focusing on learning heuristics and maintaining diverse solutions in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of exploration and theoretical understanding in applying QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, specifically focusing on learning heuristics.

Method: Develop a QD framework with a map-building strategy to visualize heuristic genotypes in the solution space and conduct experiments on fixed and dynamic instances to evaluate solution diversity and performance.

Result: The proposed map-building strategy successfully visualized and facilitated the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling heuristics, adapting well to dynamic optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework advances the application of QD algorithms to dynamic scheduling problems and highlights opportunities for further research in learning processes and scalability in dynamic combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

TL;DR: The paper utilizes algorithm footprints to study how different configurations of the CMA-ES algorithm interact with various problem characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand why algorithm configurations perform differently across problems and identify features driving these variations.

Method: Algorithm footprints are derived using six modular variants of CMA-ES, evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the BBOB suite in 5D and 30D scenarios.

Result: The study reveals both shared and distinct behavior patterns among algorithm configurations linked to problem properties and features.

Conclusion: Algorithm footprints are effective in improving interpretability and aiding in selecting appropriate configurations for specific problems.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a clustering-based visualization methodology for understanding the search dynamics of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visualization techniques for analyzing numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms fail to effectively capture the structural dynamics of search processes in complex solution spaces.

Method: The paper proposes a novel clustering-based representation and visualization methodology, tracking the evolution of cluster memberships during the search process. Two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity - are introduced to analyze search trajectories across runs and compare different algorithms.

Result: Results demonstrate the methodology's ability to provide insights on stability and comparative behaviors across ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms.

Conclusion: This methodology aids in better interpreting search dynamics, enhancing the understanding and development of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

### [219] [An Experimental Approach for Running-Time Estimation of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Numerical Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02372)
*Han Huang,Tianyu Wang,Chaoda Peng,Tongli He,Zhifeng Hao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This study proposes a practical methodology to estimate upper bounds on the running time of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in numerical optimization using adaptive sampling and statistical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The running time analysis of MOEAs is crucial for evaluating their efficiency and guiding their real-world applications. Existing studies often rely on simplifications, limiting their practical relevance.

Method: The study introduces an experimental approach leveraging the Inverted Generational Distance metric, statistical methods for gain distribution, and an adaptive sampling method to accurately estimate the running time of MOEAs.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on five MOEAs using standard benchmark suites (ZDT and DTLZ) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating running time upper bounds without simplifications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a practical, experimental complement to theoretical research in MOEAs, enhancing their applicability in real-world numerical optimization scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new theoretical model, called the multiple-gain model, to analyze running times of $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithms (EA) for combinatorial optimization problems, offering tighter time complexity bounds and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of substantial theoretical results for $(\mu+\lambda)$ EAs in combinatorial optimization problems motivated the authors to develop an improved analytical framework.

Method: The authors proposed the multiple-gain model, an enhancement of the average gain model under the sigma-algebra condition, to estimate the running time of EAs and derive bounds for specific optimization problems.

Result: The model provided tighter theoretical upper bounds for time complexity in problems such as the knapsack, $k$-MAX-SAT, and traveling salesperson problem. Experimental validations confirmed alignment with these theoretical bounds.

Conclusion: The multiple-gain model is proven to be effective for analyzing the running time of $(\mu+\lambda)$ EAs in combinatorial optimization, offering both theoretical insights and practical reliability.

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.

### [221] [DecoRTL: A Run-time Decoding Framework for RTL Code Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02226)
*Mohammad Akyash,Kimia Azar,Hadi Kamali*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating valid Register Transfer Level (RTL) code due to issues with conventional decoding strategies. This paper introduces DecoRTL, a syntax-aware and contrastive decoding strategy to improve RTL generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLM decoding strategies, designed for natural language, fail to produce structurally valid or semantically compelling RTL code, highlighting the need for adaptations to meet RTL's specific demands.

Method: The paper proposes DecoRTL, a novel decoding strategy combining self-consistency sampling for correctness and diversity, and syntax-aware temperature adaptation to adjust sampling based on token roles‚Äîsyntax-critical for lower temperatures and exploratory for higher temperatures.

Result: Using the VerilogEval benchmark, DecoRTL demonstrates substantial improvements in syntactic validity, functional correctness, and output diversity across multiple open-source LLMs, with negligible execution overhead.

Conclusion: DecoRTL offers a practical and effective inference-time solution for improving RTL code generation quality without requiring model fine-tuning, addressing key limitations of traditional decoding strategies.

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study focuses on enhancing human-robot interaction by providing context-sensitive explanations for robotic tasks, aiming to improve understanding and mitigate user confusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help users better understand robots performing complex tasks by offering appropriate explanations that address confusion and enhance interaction.

Method: Investigated user preferences for explanations during robotic cleaning tasks and proposed algorithms to identify surprising actions and construct effective explanations for BDI robots.

Result: Users expressed a desire for concise and contextually clear explanations, and algorithms were introduced to facilitate this in robotic decision-making processes.

Conclusion: Integrating these algorithms into BDI robots can significantly improve human-robot interactions, making explanations context- and user-specific.

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

*Miroslav Cibula,Krist√≠na Malinovsk√°,Matthias Kerzel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised recurrent learning method for robotic trajectory planning that learns adaptive solutions using forward and inverse kinematics models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of computational inefficiency in traditional sampling-based planners and lack of goal-aware learning in supervised sequence learning methods for robotic trajectory planning.

Method: A cognitively inspired self-supervised learning framework using a recurrent architecture is developed to build a trajectory model, leveraging paired forward and inverse kinematics models to generate robotic trajectories.

Result: The proposed model successfully learns to generate trajectories for a robotic arm, demonstrating feasibility and adaptive solution generation for kinematic planning tasks.

Conclusion: The approach has potential to enable planning for more complex robotic manipulation tasks by combining self-supervised learning and paired kinematics models to overcome traditional method shortcomings.

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Vision-Language-Action models for robotic tasks is expensive, and there is potential to improve efficiency by leveraging existing Vision Language Models for robot control.

Method: The proposed model uses Vision Language Models to predict trajectory waypoints directly in image frame coordinates instead of outputting low-level robot controls.

Result: The model shows effective sim-to-real transfer capabilities with strong performance in simulated and real-world robotic systems.

Conclusion: This novel lightweight design proves efficient to train and robot-agnostic, combining depth images and inference-time techniques for enhanced robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurate pose and heading estimation in autonomous systems, especially focusing on overcoming yaw unobservability in scenarios that rely heavily on dead-reckoning methods.

Method: The approach builds on the DRIFT algorithm by developing a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline using the invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF), introducing a novel heading correction mechanism that combines GPS course-over-ground with IMU data.

Result: The system was implemented on a customized Blue Robotics BlueBoat, validating its effectiveness in achieving drift-free localization and reliable heading estimation even in GPS-degraded conditions.

Conclusion: This work offers an open-source solution for accurate localization and orientation, paving the way for further comparative and experimental studies in a variety of mobile autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and

directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized

Conclusion: The developed simulator offers a practical and reliable solution for testing automated driving controllers, achieving cost-effective and high-fidelity results while being extendable and easy to integrate.

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers.
Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to

enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars
allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving
controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the
simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents SkelUnet, a U-Net-based Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder for efficient skeletonized map computation, enabling faster and safer path planning for UAVs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path planning often prioritizes optimal distance, but many applications require a balance between response time, safety, and path length. Skeleton maps are useful for graph-based schemes but are computationally expensive.

Method: The authors utilized a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on U-Net architecture to generate skeletonized navigation maps, called SkelUnet, enabling one-shot sampling for the entire workspace.

Result: SkelUnet was trained on 12,500 dungeon maps and tested on 250 unseen maps in a UAV simulation, achieving safer paths, connected workspaces, and reduced processing times compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: SkelUnet demonstrates efficiency and suitability for mobile service robots in structured environments due to its fast processing and robust path-planning capabilities.

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable

TL;DR: The paper introduces the creation of a Digital Twin framework for the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. It focuses on road infrastructure digitalization for simulations that integrate real-time traffic monitoring and communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing digitalization in mobility, a Digital Twin approach can foster better interaction between real and virtual environments, enabling advanced simulation and optimization of road infrastructure.

Method: The Digital Twin was constructed using camera images and LiDAR data from intelligent intersections and vehicles. The simulation framework resimulates real-world traffic data and facilitates flexible analysis through a unified interface.

Result: The framework was successfully established and is publicly accessible. Two case studies demonstrated practical applications: optimizing traffic flow and simulating security scenarios in communication systems.

Conclusion: The Digital Twin framework enhances infrastructure digitalization and real-time monitoring for complex traffic systems. Its public availability supports further advancements in simulation-based mobility research.

Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

*Maryem Fadili,Mohamed Anis Ghaoui,Louis Lecrosnier,Steve Pechberti,Redouane Khemmar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a late collaboration framework for 3D sensor fusion in autonomous driving that doesn‚Äôt require access to individual detection models and achieves significant error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in collaborative perception for autonomous driving, such as high communication bandwidth demands and challenges in preserving proprietary detection models.

Method: The proposed method is a late collaborative framework that fuses 3D bounding box attributes (e.g., size, position, orientation) without requiring access to internal detection models.

Result: The framework reduces position error by up to 5 times, scale error by 7.5, and orientation error by half. It achieves 100% precision and recall for multi-agent detections.

Conclusion: This framework offers an effective, scalable solution for real-world collaborative perception, setting a new benchmark in autonomous driving by overcoming major practical limitations.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

*Shivam Chaubey,Francesco Verdoja,Shankar Deka,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shared control framework using a Constrained Optimal Control Problem with Control Invariant Sets to improve user intent integration, safety, and feasibility in tasks like robotics and autonomous driving. The framework is validated with a large-scale study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shared control methods often face challenges such as scalability, unpredictable user input, and the inability to guarantee safety or feasibility, particularly for practical real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces a novel assistive controller framework built on a Constrained Optimal Control Problem. It incorporates offline-computed Control Invariant Sets to calculate control actions online, ensuring feasibility, safety, and minimal override of user intentions.

Result: The new framework was validated through a large-scale user study with 66 participants in a computer game environment. It demonstrated consistent improvements in task load, trust, perceived control, and performance without compromising safety or user intent.

Conclusion: The proposed shared control framework enhances user experience, task performance, and safety while addressing the shortcomings of previous approaches. It holds promise for real-world implementation in diverse domains.

Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

*Xiang Zhou,Xinyu Zhang,Qingrui Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical learning framework for quadruped robots to improve their ability to handle external disturbances by balancing robustness and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust and compliant quadruped locomotion under unforeseen external disturbances remains challenging. Existing methods often compromise compliance for robustness, resulting in energy-inefficient motions.

Method: The method involves a two-stage hierarchical learning framework. Stage one trains a velocity-tracking policy and a force estimator based on proprioceptive data. Stage two learns a compliance action module inspired by impedance control, enabling real-time velocity adjustments to external forces.

Result: The proposed method improves robustness, energy efficiency, and safety for quadruped robots. It outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based locomotion controllers in experiments.

Conclusion: The compliance action module is crucial for achieving a balanced response to external forces, enabling robust and energy-efficient locomotion in quadruped robots.

Abstract: Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of
unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion
robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Method: Proposes vibration-actuated helix-shaped legs with control parameter analysis through simulation and experiments, validated by trajectory and navigation testing.

Result: Effective locomotion modes, robust control parameters, and reliable navigation demonstrated in closed-loop experiments.

Conclusion: Flix-Walker achieves robust and versatile mobility using minimal hardware, emphasizing the potential of compliant mechanisms in robotics.

Abstract: Under-actuated compliant robotic systems offer a promising approach to
mitigating actuation and control challenges by harnessing pre-designed,
embodied dynamic behaviors. This paper presents Flix-Walker, a novel,
untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as
legs, which are actuated by vibrations from just two motors to achieve three
distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype
experiments. The effects of system and environmental variations on locomotion
performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ArtGS is a new robotics framework combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with visual-physical modeling to improve manipulation of articulated objects, showing superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics still struggles with effective manipulation of articulated objects due to their kinematic complexity and existing methods lacking advanced physical reasoning.

Method: ArtGS uses multi-view RGB-D reconstruction and a vision-language model to extract object semantics and structure. It integrates dynamic 3DGS rendering for optimizing articulated motion constraints and enhancing manipulation policies.

Result: ArtGS outperforms prior methods in joint estimation and manipulation success rates for a variety of articulated objects, validated in both simulations and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ArtGS demonstrates significant progress in efficient, scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation, paving the way for practical robotic applications.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,
scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.
Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments
demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint
estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of
articulated objects. Additional images and videos are available on the project

that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level

*Ananya Rao,Alyssa Hargis,David Wettergreen,Howie Choset*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to optimally assign starting locations for heterogeneous robotic teams in disaster response scenarios using an enhanced ergodic optimization framework, leading to improved coverage performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in deploying robotic teams for disaster response, specifically the lack of research in determining optimal starting locations for robots with diverse capabilities.

Method: The paper formulates a joint optimization problem and integrates a constraint into an ergodic optimization framework to allocate start locations. The approach is adapted for heterogeneous robots and assumes potential starting points derived from expert knowledge or aerial imagery.

Result: The method demonstrates significant improvements in coverage performance, with an average increase of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91% on real-world data, compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Optimal allocation of starting locations for robotic teams, considering their heterogeneity, enhances their operational efficiency in disaster response scenarios.

Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is
crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical motion planning pipeline for mobile manipulators using collision-free path exploration and trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address efficient motion planning for differential drive mobile manipulators, considering nonholonomic dynamics and optimality in complex environments.

Method: The pipeline begins by identifying multiple topologically distinct, collision-free base paths, followed by parallel trajectory sampling and optimization utilizing polynomial trajectories and arc length-yaw parameterization.

Result: Achieves feasible and dynamically optimal whole-body trajectories for mobile manipulators.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles nonholonomic dynamics and facilitates efficient and optimal motion planning for mobile manipulators.

Abstract: We present an efficient hierarchical motion planning pipeline for
differential drive mobile manipulators. Our approach first searches for
multiple collisionfree and topologically distinct paths for the mobile base to
extract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and
optimization are then conducted in parallel to explore feasible whole-body
trajectories. For trajectory optimization, we employ polynomial trajectories
and arc length-yaw parameterization, enabling efficient handling of the
nonholonomic dynamics while ensuring optimality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiGen, a framework that enhances physics simulators with generative models to enable multisensory simulation, focusing on robot pouring tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in sim-to-real transfer for multimodal robotic tasks, particularly as simulating modalities like sound is challenging compared to vision.

Method: A new framework, MultiGen, integrates generative models with physics simulators to synthesize realistic audio-visual interactions, training robot policies without using real-world data.

Result: Effective zero-shot transfer of robot pouring tasks to real-world conditions is achieved, even with new containers and liquids.

Conclusion: Generative models show promise in bridging the multimodal simulation-to-reality gap and advancing multisensory robotic capabilities.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

TL;DR: This study surveys aspiring software engineers' preparation for technical interviews, finding that candidates rarely train in realistic settings and current educational courses fail to prepare them adequately, leading to stress and unpreparedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand candidate preparation methods for technical interviews, the challenges faced, and the influence of computing curricula on preparation.

Method: The researchers distributed a survey to 131 candidates who were actively preparing for technical interviews to gather insights on their preparation techniques and experiences.

Result: Findings indicate candidates seldom train in authentic environments, and educational courses do not effectively support their preparation, contributing to high levels of stress and a feeling of unpreparedness.

Conclusion: The paper recommends actionable measures for educators and stakeholders to better support aspiring software engineers in preparing for technical interviews.

Abstract: To obtain employment, aspiring software engineers must complete technical
interviews -- a hiring process which involves candidates writing code while
communicating to an audience. However, the complexities of tech interviews are
difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and
unpreparedness. Based on our findings, we provide implications for stakeholders
to enhance tech interview preparation for candidates pursuing software

### [243] [Structural Code Search using Natural Language Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02107)
*Ben Limpanukorn,Yanjun Wang,Zach Patterson,Pranav Garg,Murali Krishna Ramanathan,Xiaofei Ma,Anoop Deoras,Miryung Kim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for using natural language (NL) queries to perform structural code searches, making the process more intuitive than traditional domain-specific language (DSL)-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often face challenges searching code effectively, as current tools mostly rely on keywords, regular expressions, or complex DSLs for structural searches, which can have a steep learning curve.

Method: The authors propose combining the reasoning abilities of a large language model (LLM) with structural search tools (Semgrep and GQL) to translate natural language queries into DSL queries for more accessible and efficient structural code search.

Result: The approach achieved high precision and recall (55%-70%) and outperformed baseline methods for semantic code search and LLM retrieval by up to 57% and 14% in F1 scores.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective solution for structural code search by leveraging LLMs for NL-to-DSL query translation, significantly simplifying the search process for developers.

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

*Md Nahidul Islam Opu,Fatima Islam Mouri,Rick Kazman,Yuanfang Cai,Shaiful Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates whether internal software metrics can predict mobile app popularity before release, using machine learning models and a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide developers with strategic insights by predicting app popularity before release using internal software metrics measurable from source code.

Method: Analysis involves extracting code metrics, metadata, and additional data such as reviews and download counts, followed by regression and binary classification modeling using three feature sets.

Result: Regression models yielded low $R^2$ scores due to skewed data, but binary classification models improved performance, with a Multilayer Perceptron achieving an F1-score of 0.72.

Conclusion: Internal code metrics are useful indicators for predicting app popularity, contradicting earlier findings that dismissed these metrics as predictors of software quality.

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of
software quality.

*Cristina Martinez Montes,Daniela Grassi,Nicole Novielli,Birgit Penzenstadle*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the correlation between stress measured through psychometric tools and biometric data, finding limited success in identifying stress using current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stress assessment relies on self-reporting, which has potential biases. The paper explores the integration of psychometric and biometric methods for better reliability.

Method: Participants completed pre-surveys, engaged in programming tasks under time constraints wearing biometric sensors, answered post-surveys, and attended exit interviews.

Result: Psychometric measures found no stress, participant interviews gave mixed results on stress perceptions, while biometric data showed significant effects only in EDA phasic peaks.

Conclusion: The stress-induction method via time constraints was inadequate. Future studies require refined methods for linking psychometric and biometric stress indicators.

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Jil Kl√ºnder,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper highlights the variations in sentiment analysis tool effectiveness across developer communication datasets and introduces methods to guide tool selection based on dataset characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistent performance of sentiment analysis tools across datasets from various platforms threatens the reliability of AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.

Method: The study analyzes linguistic and statistical features from 10 developer communication datasets across five platforms and evaluates the performance of 14 sentiment analysis tools. They propose a mapping approach and questionnaire for recommending appropriate sentiment tools based on dataset traits.

Result: Transformer-based models like SetFit and RoBERTa deliver strong results but their effectiveness differs by context. Dataset characteristics significantly influence sentiment analysis tool effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach helps researchers and practitioners select suitable sentiment analysis tools, emphasizing the importance of considering dataset-specific features and the need for ongoing evaluation.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

### [247] [Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182)
*Fangjian Lei,Jiawen Liu,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou,Derek Truong,William Alexander*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent approach using two LLM-based agents to generate explanations for COBOL code at function, file, and project levels, demonstrating significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty of maintaining COBOL codebases due to their age, complexity, lack of documentation, and unique syntactical challenges that hinder effective use of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors developed a multi-agent approach with two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate contextual explanations for COBOL code at various levels, overcoming token window size limitations.

Result: The method showed significant improvement in code explanation metrics (METEOR: 12.67%, chrF: 18.59%, and SentenceBERT: 0.62% at function level), as well as in explaining the purpose and functionality of files and projects more effectively than baseline approaches.

Conclusion: This multi-agent LLM-based framework improves understanding and maintenance of COBOL systems by generating accurate and clear explanations for different abstraction levels, offering a solution to challenges in legacy codebases.

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

### [248] [VeFIA: An Efficient Inference Auditing Framework for Vertical Federated Collaborative Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02376)
*Chung-ju Huang,Ziqi Zhang,Yinggui Wang,Binghui Wang,Tao Wei,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeFIA, a framework for auditing inference software accuracy in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) systems without compromising data privacy or inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFL lacks a mechanism for auditing the correctness of inference software execution, raising concerns about computation accuracy.

Method: VeFIA uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and a coordinator to validate computation results, employing random sampling for auditing without additional latency.

Result: VeFIA detects abnormal inference execution with 99.99% certainty when errors exceed 5.4%, achieving 100% in positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and true positive rate.

Conclusion: The paper offers the first framework enabling reliable auditing of inference software execution in VFL while preserving data privacy and system efficiency.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

*Chen Yang,Ziqi Wang,Yanjie Jiang,Lin Yang,Yuteng Zheng,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RTED, a new method to catch Python type errors via type-aware test generation, achieving superior detection and precision results over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving software reliability by addressing frequent Python runtime type errors, which hinder developer productivity and are challenging due to high false positives of static analysis tools.

Method: RTED employs a novel approach combining type constraint analysis and reflective validation to guide test generation and reduce false positive errors.

Result: RTED detected 22-29 more type errors than existing methods on benchmarks, achieved 173.9%-245.9% precision improvement, and uncovered 12 type errors in open-source projects.

Conclusion: RTED enhances Python type error detection with better coverage and precision, demonstrating strong potential to improve automated testing reliability in real-world software contexts.

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

### [250] [Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02533)
*Miguel Romero-Arjona,Jos√© A. Parejo,Juan C. Alonso,Ana B. S√°nchez,Aitor Arrieta,Sergio Segura*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Meta-Fair proposes an automated method to test fairness in large language models (LLMs) by utilizing metamorphic testing and leveraging LLMs themselves for input and output evaluations, achieving high bias detection precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current fairness testing methods for LLMs which are manual, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale.

Method: Meta-Fair employs metamorphic testing, where model outputs are analyzed for bias using controlled input modifications (metamorphic relations). It also uses LLMs to generate diverse test cases and evaluate outcomes automatically.

Result: The method was tested on 12 LLMs and revealed bias in 29% of cases, achieving an average precision of 92% and evaluator F1-scores of up to 0.79.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs, paving the way for automated, scalable fairness testing, although challenges to broader applicability remain.

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

*Alexander Korn,Samuel Gorsch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMREI is a chatbot designed to automate requirements elicitation interviews, reducing human errors and improving scalability, with performance comparable to human interviewers in key aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requirements elicitation interviews are critical but time-intensive, error-prone, and dependent on skilled analysts. Automation could address these challenges.

Method: The study examines zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting for optimizing LLMREI's performance in 33 simulated stakeholder interviews. Fine-tuning was initially attempted but abandoned.

Result: LLMREI performs similarly to human interviewers in minimizing errors, extracts a significant portion of requirements, and asks context-sensitive questions.

Conclusion: LLMREI showcases potential for automating requirements elicitation, particularly in scenarios involving numerous stakeholders, while addressing scalability and error reduction challenges.

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

### [252] [Human-Machine Collaboration and Ethical Considerations in Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02578)
*Zoe Pfister*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how to effectively integrate Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) into Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with considerations for human interaction and ethical values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of achieving seamless human-machine collaboration in Adaptive CPS, including different operational cadences and privacy concerns.

Method: The research proposes methods for incorporating human-machine interaction principles into CPS feedback loops and frameworks for integrating ethics and human values across the system lifecycle.

Result: Novel processes for enabling HMT in CPS and frameworks for ethical integration are developed to promote collaboration while respecting human values.

Conclusion: Implementing ethical HMT in Adaptive CPS can enhance teamwork and human-centric system design, bridging operational and ethical gaps in CPS feedback loops.

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

similar concepts, creating communication challenges. To better understand these
divergences, we have started investigating how SE fundamentals from the SER

*Jiaxing Wang,Yifeng Yu,Jiahan Song,Bin Cao,Jing Fan,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLHGNN, a framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs and uses reinforcement learning to predict the next activity in business processes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence-based methods for next activity prediction fail to account for non-sequential relationships that arise in parallel executions and conditional dependencies, while graph-based methods lack adaptability to varying process complexities.

Method: RLHGNN converts event logs into heterogeneous process graphs using three distinct edge types and employs reinforcement learning to dynamically determine optimal graph structures for process instances. It uses heterogeneous graph convolution for next-activity prediction.

Result: RLHGNN achieves consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods on six real-world datasets while ensuring an inference latency of approximately 1 ms, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: RLHGNN is a highly practical and accurate framework for predicting next activities in business processes, effectively modeling both sequential and non-sequential dependencies while offering real-time performance.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

*Sahar Ahmadisakha,Lech Bialek,Mohamed Soliman,Vasilios Andrikopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces 'sustainability flags' to identify sustainability discussions in online Q&A forums, with preliminary results showing improved classification performance and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of cloud computing has highlighted the need to incorporate sustainability into architectural decisions, but it remains difficult to identify such discussions in practitioner forums due to a lack of clear guidelines.

Method: The paper proposes the development of sustainability flags through thematic analysis of sustainability practices from cloud providers and evaluates their effectiveness using a controlled experiment on cloud architecture posts.

Result: Preliminary results indicate that sustainability flags lead to fewer posts being classified as sustainability-related but with higher certainty, significantly improved performance, and better usability compared to standard definitions.

Conclusion: Sustainability flags are a promising approach for identifying sustainability discussions in cloud architecture, offering better precision and usability compared to vague definitions alone.

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

### [256] [Legal Requirements Translation from Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02846)
*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach using textual entailment and in-context learning to automatically extract and represent legal metadata as Python code, addressing challenges in legal compliance for software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring software system compliance with legal regulations is resource-intensive, especially for smaller organizations lacking dedicated legal expertise. Existing automated methods for metadata extraction from legal text fail to address interrelationships among metadata attributes and rely on manual labeling or heuristic approaches, which limit generalizability.

Method: The method employs textual entailment and in-context learning to generate a canonical representation of legal text based on a manually created Python class structure. This acts as a domain-specific metamodel, capturing structural and semantic metadata along with their interconnections.

Result: The approach was tested on 13 U.S. state data breach notification laws, showing strong performance with 89.4% test case success, 82.2 precision, and 88.7 recall.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently captures metadata and interrelationships from legal texts without relying heavily on manual labeling, making it applicable to new legislation and beneficial for organizations in streamlining compliance.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This research applies GPT-4 to generate follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation, demonstrating that LLM-generated questions are comparable or superior to human-authored questions, especially when guided by common interviewer mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interviews for requirements elicitation face challenges such as cognitive overload and unfamiliarity with the domain, which hinder the quality of interviewer questions. The study explores whether large language models like GPT-4 can alleviate these problems by generating high-quality follow-up interview questions.

Method: The authors leveraged a framework of common interviewer mistake types and GPT-4 to develop guided follow-up questions during stakeholder interviews. Two controlled experiments were conducted: one comparing LLM-generated and human-authored questions, and another assessing LLM-generated questions guided by interviewer mistake types.

Result: Findings reveal that LLM-generated questions are on par in clarity, relevance, and informativeness with human-authored questions. When guided by interviewer mistake types, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored ones.

Conclusion: This study suggests that LLMs like GPT-4 can effectively support interviewers by generating high-quality and strategically guided follow-up questions, thereby improving the requirements elicitation process.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

*Guobin Shen,Dongcheng Zhao,Yiting Dong,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study demonstrates convergent evolution in computational solutions between human brain activity and AI models, showing stronger alignment as models improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models spontaneously develop brain-like computational strategies as they optimize for task performance.

Method: Large-scale analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal representations of over 600 AI models in language and vision tasks.

Result: Higher-performing AI models exhibited stronger brain alignment, with language models aligning more strongly than vision models.

Conclusion: Brain-like representations appear to be a stepping stone toward higher AI capabilities, and task optimization naturally leads to brain-inspired computational strategies.

Abstract: Artificial and biological systems may evolve similar computational solutions
despite fundamental differences in architecture and learning mechanisms -- a
form of convergent evolution. We demonstrate this phenomenon through
large-scale analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal
representations of over 600 AI models spanning language and vision domains,
from 1.33M to 72B parameters. Analyzing 60 million alignment measurements
reveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain
alignment without explicit neural constraints, with language models showing
markedly stronger correlation (r=0.89, p<7.5e-13) than vision models (r=0.53,
p<2.0e-44). Crucially, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that brain alignment
consistently precedes performance improvements during training, suggesting that
developing brain-like representations may be a necessary stepping stone toward
higher capabilities. We find systematic patterns: language models exhibit
strongest alignment with limbic and integrative regions, while vision models
show progressive alignment with visual cortices; deeper processing layers
converge across modalities; and as representational scale increases, alignment
systematically shifts from primary sensory to higher-order associative regions.
These findings provide compelling evidence that optimization for task
performance naturally drives AI systems toward brain-like computational
strategies, offering both fundamental insights into principles of intelligent
information processing and practical guidance for developing more capable AI
systems.

*Llewellin RG Jegels*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether contemporary AI architectures like deep recursion and self-referential mechanisms can indicate machine consciousness, concluding that such functionalities enhance capabilities but do not imply true consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the question of whether modern AI architectures display evidence of machine consciousness by examining various philosophical, cognitive, and technical perspectives.

Method: The study utilizes conceptual analysis, case studies, and neuroscience findings combined with normative risk assessment informed by phenomenology and embodied cognition.

Result: The paper finds that while functional self-modeling in AI is possible, symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia remain unresolved, preventing attribution of sentience to current systems.

Conclusion: Recursive self-referential AI designs improve functionality but do not equate to consciousness or moral status. Ethical and legal implications are explored, stressing the unresolved nature of machine sentience.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether contemporary AI architectures employing deep
recursion, meta-learning, and self-referential mechanisms provide evidence of
machine consciousness. Integrating philosophical history, cognitive science,
and AI engineering, it situates recursive algorithms within a lineage spanning
Cartesian dualism, Husserlian intentionality, Integrated Information Theory,
the Global Workspace model, and enactivist perspectives. The argument proceeds
through textual analysis, comparative architecture review, and synthesis of
neuroscience findings on integration and prediction. Methodologically, the
study combines conceptual analysis, case studies, and normative risk assessment
informed by phenomenology and embodied cognition. Technical examples, including
transformer self-attention, meta-cognitive agents, and neuromorphic chips,
illustrate how functional self-modeling can arise without subjective
experience. By distinguishing functional from phenomenal consciousness, the
paper argues that symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia remain
unresolved barriers to attributing sentience to current AI. Ethical analysis
explores risks of premature anthropomorphism versus neglect of future sentient
systems; legal implications include personhood, liability, authorship, and

*Zhaoze Wang,Genela Morris,Dori Derdikman,Pratik Chaudhari,Vijay Balasubramanian*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper examines how grid cells and place cells in the brain collaborate to enable spatial planning and memory recall through mechanisms in the medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why animals retain both grid and place cell-based spatial representations and explore their functional collaboration in supporting spatial planning and memory recall.

Method: The authors utilized an extended theoretical framework combined with a single-layer RNN model to mimic the HC-MEC loop and simulate the planning subnetwork. They demonstrated planning and recall mechanisms through mathematical modeling and computational analysis.

Result: The research shows that grid cells can sequentially update states toward a goal while intermediate grid activity triggers place cell pattern completions, reconstructing experiences along planned paths.

Conclusion: Grid and place cell representations are complementary, supporting spatial planning and memory reconstruction. This dynamic interaction leads to testable predictions about the neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behavior.

Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are believed to path
integrate speed and direction signals to activate at triangular grids of
locations in an environment, thus implementing a population code for position.
In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined
locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to
environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells
both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why
animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place
representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated
tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals
maintain grid and place representations together to support planning.
Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory
information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall
of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting
subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous
theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local
transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further
show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward
the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place
cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We
demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously
models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent
mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place
system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for decoding brain-wide neural activity to understand animal behaviors, showcasing accuracy and interpretability in behavioral prediction from zebrafish brain imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how animal behavior emerges from complex neural activity in large mammalian brains remains a major challenge in neuroscience, necessitating innovations in decoding tools.

Method: The authors systematically evaluated pre-trained LLMs, specifically NLP4Neuro, on zebrafish neural and behavioral datasets to test their neural decoding capability using pre-trained weights from textual data.

Result: Pre-trained LLMs outperform in neural decoding, with DeepSeek Coder-7b excelling in behavior prediction, tail movement predictions, and generating anatomically consistent interpretability of neuron salience.

Conclusion: LLMs, bolstered by pre-training on text data, show promise as tools for brain-wide neural decoding and circuit analysis, bridging neuroscience and machine learning disciplines.

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

*Kai Chen,Zhong-qi K. Tian,Yifei Chen,Songting Li,Douglas Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the pairwise time-delayed transfer entropy (PTD-TE) method for reconstructing structural connectivity in networks, addressing high-dimensional challenges and demonstrating superior performance in various contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand dynamics and functions of complex networks, there is a need for accurate structural connectivity inference methods, especially since connectivity is often unobservable.

Method: The proposed PTD-TE method calculates transfer entropy values by incorporating time delays and pairwise analysis, theoretically linking these values to node coupling strengths and resolving issues related to high-dimensional probability estimation.

Result: PTD-TE successfully reconstructs network connectivity with high accuracy and robustness across biological, physical, and electrophysiological systems, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PTD-TE provides a scalable, model-agnostic tool for structural connectivity inference, with broad implications for analyzing nonlinear real-world networks.

Abstract: Analyzing network structural connectivity is crucial for understanding
dynamics and functions of complex networks across disciplines. In many
networks, structural connectivity is not observable, which requires to be
inferred via causal inference methods. Among them, transfer entropy (TE) is one
of the most broadly applied causality measure due to its model-free property.
However, TE often faces the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional
probability estimation, and the relation between the inferred causal
connectivity and the underlying structural connectivity remains poorly
understood. Here we address these issues by proposing a pairwise time-delayed
transfer entropy (PTD-TE) method. We theoretically establish a quadratic
relationship between PTD-TE values and node coupling strengths, and demonstrate
its immunity to dimensionality issues and broad applicability. Tests on
biological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and
electrophysiological data show PTD-TE achieves consistent, high-performance
reconstructions. Compared to a bunch of existing approaches for network
connectivity reconstruction, PTD-TE outperforms these methods across various
network systems in accuracy and robustness against noise. Our framework
provides a scalable, model-agnostic tool for structural connectivity inference
in nonlinear real-world networks.

*Kai Chen,Mingzhang Wang,Songting Li,Douglas Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for reconstructing neuronal networks undergoing structural changes using a method that combines change point detection and time-delayed correlation coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately reconstructing neuronal networks that experience structural changes, which traditional methods struggle to handle due to their static assumptions.

Method: The proposed framework integrates connectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with a pairwise time-delayed correlation coefficient (TDCC) method, supported by theoretical analysis and simulations.

Result: The method successfully reconstructs networks, handling changes in topology and synaptic coupling strengths, while demonstrating robustness even with sparse subnetwork data.

Conclusion: The CPD-TDCC framework fills a critical gap in neuronal network reconstruction, offering an effective tool for experimental situations involving dynamic structural connectivity changes.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics and functions critically depends on knowledge of
the network connectivity among neurons. However, the complexity of brain
structural connectivity, coupled with continuous modifications driven by
synaptic plasticity, makes its direct experimental measurement particularly
challenging. Conventional connectivity inference methods based on neuronal
recordings often assumes a static underlying structural connectivity and
requires stable statistical features of neural activities, making them
unsuitable for reconstructing structural connectivity that undergoes changes.
To fulfill the needs of reconstructing networks undergoing potential structural
changes, we propose a unified network reconstruction framework that combines
connectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with pairwise time-delayed
correlation coefficient (TDCC) method. For general neuronal networks in
balanced regimes, we develop a theoretical analysis for discriminating changes
in structural connectivity based on the fluctuation of neuronal voltage time
series. We then demonstrate a pairwise TDCC method to reconstruct the network
using spike train recordings segmented at the detected change points. We show
the effectiveness of our CPD-TDCC network reconstruction using large-scale
network simulations with multiple neuronal models. Crucially, our method
accommodates networks with changes in both network topologies and synaptic
coupling strengths while retaining accuracy even with sparsely sampled
subnetwork data, achieving a critical advancement for practical applications in
real experimental situations. Our CPD-TDCC framework addresses the critical gap
in network reconstruction by accounting connectivity-induced changes points,
potentially offering a valuable tool for studying structure and dynamics in the
cortical brain.

*Diogo Sousa*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mathematical theory of consciousness involving dopamine and serotonin as key regulators. Validated using Parkinson's data, it captures complex dynamics across conscious states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a comprehensive mechanistic framework explaining the full spectrum of conscious states using neurochemical parameters.

Method: Developing a mathematical model grounded in clinical data and testing it using Parkinson's disease patient data, analyzing medication and disease severity interactions.

Result: Findings show a state-specific, non-linear interaction between dopaminergic input and system integrity, confirmed by significant data analysis results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully explains diverse conscious states, offering clinical and evolutionary insights, validated using large-scale data.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theory of consciousness grounded in
mathematical formalism and supported by clinical data analysis. The framework
developed herein demonstrates that consciousness exists as a continuous,
non-monotonic function across a high-dimensional neurochemical space, with
dopamine serving as the primary intensity regulator and serotonin (5-HT2A) as
the complexity modulator. This work offers mechanistic explanations for the
full spectrum of conscious states, from deep sleep and psychosis to the
ultimate collapse in neural death. The theory explains paradoxical phenomena
such as prefrontal cortex hypoactivity during seizures, the evolutionary
persistence of psychosis-prone individuals, and why controlled administration
of classical 5-HT2A agonists shows a comparatively low incidence of serious
medical events (< 0.01 % in modern clinical trials), while dopaminergic excess
proves rapidly lethal. The framework is tested using 70,290 sleep nights from
242 Parkinson's disease patients, using disease severity (UPDRS) as a proxy for
system integrity and medication (LEDD) as a proxy for dopaminergic input. The
analysis reveals a significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction (beta=-1.7, p<.0001),
confirming the model's prediction of state-dependent, non-linear dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and provide theoretical guarantees for the adaptive ISTA, which has been widely used for solving LASSO problems but lacks comprehensive theoretical analysis.

Method: The authors analyze the adaptive ISTA, focusing on its thresholding strategy based on noise estimation using median absolute deviation, and investigate properties of its fixed points and convergence behaviors.

Result: They uncover properties like scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability of fixed points, demonstrate local linear convergence, and describe global convergence behavior of the algorithm.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into the theoretical underpinnings of adaptive ISTA, reinforcing its utility and behavior in solving LASSO problems.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm leveraging Christoffel sampling and optimal experimental design, improving computational efficiency and noise handling in estimating conditional expectations with polluted data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently estimating conditional expectations under heavy noise where existing small noise-focused methods fail.

Method: Combined Christoffel sampling with optimal experimental design and adaptive random subspace techniques.

Result: Improved sample complexity and computational efficiency demonstrated theoretically and numerically.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively handles high noise and extends well to convex-constrained settings and adaptive procedures.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem
in computational finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix by leveraging auxiliary data from source datasets in matrix completion tasks.

Method: The authors propose a transfer learning framework for matrix completion, providing convergence rate proofs, minimax optimality guarantees, and introducing source dataset relevance detection.

Result: The developed approach surpasses traditional methods when source datasets closely resemble the target matrix, with simulations and real-world applications validating the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The study confirms the benefits of utilizing relevant auxiliary data in matrix completion, offering theoretical insights and practical tools for improving target matrix estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the
validity of our methodology.

*Jikai Jin,Lester Mackey,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the estimation of treatment effects in causal inference depends on treatment noise distribution, proposing new methods that outperform existing ones under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the widely used double machine learning (DML) estimator for causal inference, particularly its performance under non-Gaussian treatment noise.

Method: The authors analyze the performance of the DML estimator in various treatment noise distributions and propose new ACE procedures using higher-order cumulant estimators to improve robustness against nuisance errors.

Result: DML is shown to be minimax-optimal for Gaussian noise but suboptimal for non-Gaussian noise. New ACE procedures demonstrate higher-order robustness, supported by theoretical analysis and synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed ACE procedures provide significant improvements over DML when treatment noise is non-Gaussian, advancing the field of structure-agnostic causal inference.

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a block-diagonal extension to improve sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) and introduces a new Power Expectation Propagation (PEP) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse variational GP methods rely on diagonal scaling matrices, which may not fully capture the complexity of posterior distributions. Improving these methods with better approximations can enhance model performance.

Method: The method introduces a block-diagonal scaling matrix into sparse variational GPs and revisits the PEP framework to leverage structured approximate posteriors.

Result: The block-diagonal approximation performs similarly to or better than diagonal methods in regression tasks, without increasing computational cost. The new PEP framework is competitive across various configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve sparse GPs by providing better approximations and offer practitioners more flexible, efficient alternatives to existing approaches.

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into mobile devices faces energy and efficiency barriers. This paper introduces FUSE, an energy-aware governor, reducing latency for mobile LLMs while maintaining energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs in mobile applications faces major challenges due to their high computational, memory, and energy demands, exacerbated by the independent operation of mobile governors for CPU, GPU, and memory.

Method: The study measures inefficiencies in current LLM frameworks on mobile devices. It conducts an in-depth analysis of the interaction among mobile governors and proposes FUSE, a unified energy-aware governor for optimizing LLM inference performance and energy usage.

Result: FUSE decreases the time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% on average, with no increase in energy-per-token consumption across various mobile LLM models.

Conclusion: FUSE successfully addresses energy and latency inefficiencies in deploying LLMs on mobile devices, enhancing their practicality without additional energy costs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaFO, a Bayesian transformer model inspired by large language models, to address challenges in AI-driven metamaterial design, enabling zero-shot predictions, improved inverse design, and enhanced generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-driven strategies for designing metamaterials face limitations like poor out-of-distribution generalization, task-specific retraining, and reliance on separate models for forward and inverse design.

Method: The authors developed MetaFO, a Bayesian transformer-based foundation model modeled after large language models, which approaches metamaterials as operators that map material properties to structural responses.

Result: MetaFO achieves probabilistic, zero-shot predictions for material properties and structural responses, excels in nonlinear inverse design even under OOD conditions, and expands the metamaterial design space.

Conclusion: MetaFO represents a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, offering a scalable and generalizable framework for advancing material functionalities and next-generation innovations.

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

Motivation: The study aims to address the high cost and resource requirements of usability evaluations in human-centered design by exploring synthetic heuristic evaluation methods using multimodal LLMs.

Method: A synthetic heuristic evaluation framework was developed, leveraging multimodal LLMs to analyze app images and provide design feedback. Comparisons were made with evaluations conducted by experienced UX practitioners.

Result: The synthetic evaluation identified 73% and 77% of issues in comparison to human evaluators who identified 57% and 63%. The synthetic approach excelled in detecting layout issues but struggled with UI components, design conventions, and cross-screen violations.

Conclusion: Synthetic heuristic evaluations using LLMs show promise, outperforming human evaluators in certain areas while having limitations. This research informs how LLMs can be integrated into usability evaluation methods effectively.

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper examines the emotional responses of conversational agents, specifically ChatGPT and Gemini, when tasked with creating empathetic dialogues using a curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing integration of conversational agents into human interactions across domains, necessitating enhanced emotional intelligence and empathy.

Method: The research employed a manually crafted dataset of empathic behavior, extended it using LLMs (ChatGPT and Gemini), and evaluated emotional progression with sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.

Result: Generated dialogues demonstrated emotional alignment with the intended structure, but human evaluation highlighted gaps in perceived empathy and coherence.

Conclusion: Emotion modeling in conversational agents requires both structural alignment and qualitative depth, stressing the need for a blend of automated and human-centered methodologies.

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

TL;DR: The study explores how data scientists construct target variables in predictive modeling tasks, focusing on fuzzy concepts in education and healthcare. It identifies a bricolage process used to align objectives and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to understand the poorly comprehended process by which data scientists translate vague, hard-to-define concepts into actionable target variables for predictive modeling tasks.

Method: Conducting interviews with 15 data scientists in education and healthcare to analyze their approaches to constructing target variables.

Result: Findings reveal a bricolage process where data scientists iteratively balance high-level goals (validity, simplicity, predictability, etc.) with practical limitations. They employ strategies like substituting target variables and layering multiple outcomes.

Conclusion: The paper highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary research in HCI, CSCW, and ML to provide improved support for crafting target variables in predictive modeling.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio is a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model (LALM) that achieves robust auditory perception and instruction-following without requiring task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LALMs struggle with catastrophic forgetting of language abilities when trained with manually curated or synthesized audio-instruction sets. This paper aims to preserve the original language capabilities of LLMs while enabling effective auditory understanding.

Method: The authors propose DeSTA, a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy where the backbone LLM creates its own training targets, avoiding task-specific tuning. They also construct DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale dataset with 5 million samples spanning diverse audio types.

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results across numerous audio-language benchmarks, outperforming existing data construction and training methods in auditory perception and instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: Carefully designed data construction, such as the DeSTA strategy, can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting in LALMs while maintaining robust auditory perception and zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

### [276] [Multi-agent Auditory Scene Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02755)
*Caleb Rascon,Luis Gato-Diaz,Eduardo Garc√≠a-Alarc√≥n*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system for auditory scene analysis (ASA) that operates tasks in parallel with feedback mechanisms, improving robustness and reducing errors, computational complexity, and response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auditory scene analysis systems operate tasks linearly, which leads to high response times and error-prone processes, especially in applications requiring minimal computational resources. This paper addresses the need for an efficient ASA system with reduced sensitivity to task errors and smaller computational footprints.

Method: The authors propose a Multi-Agent Auditory Scene Analysis (MASA) system that executes the tasks (e.g., sound source location, separation, and classification) in parallel. Feedback loops are integrated between tasks to correct local errors. The system is implemented as a framework using open-source tools such as JACK for sound handling and ROS2 for agent communication.

Result: The proposed MASA system demonstrated robustness to local errors, lower computational complexity, and reduced response time, while maintaining the flexibility for users to add custom-designed agents.

Conclusion: The MASA system provides a practical solution to the challenges of traditional ASA systems by improving efficiency and adaptability, making it suitable for applications sensitive to time and computational constraints.

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

### [277] [Self-Steering Deep Non-Linear Spatially Selective Filters for Efficient Extraction of Moving Speakers under Weak Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02791)
*Jakob Kienegger,Alina Mannanova,Huajian Fang,Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a lightweight tracking method combined with temporal feedback to achieve high performance in speech enhancement for dynamic scenarios without excessive computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art methods provide excellent speech enhancement for stationary speakers but require resource-heavy tracking algorithms for dynamic speaker scenarios, making them unsuitable for constrained environments like real-time processing.

Method: The authors introduce a low-complexity tracking algorithm based on a particle filter and augment it with temporal feedback from the enhanced speech signal for improved tracking and speech enhancement.

Result: Experiments show that this interplay significantly improves tracking accuracy and enhances speech quality, as confirmed by evaluations on synthetic datasets and listening tests with real-world recordings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a scalable and effective alternative to existing comparable methods for real-time speech enhancement with dynamic speakers, making it preferred in constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

### [278] [Resolving CAP Through Automata-Theoretic Economic Design: A Unified Mathematical Framework for Real-Time Partition-Tolerant Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02464)
*Craig S Wright*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper reframes the CAP theorem as a constraint optimization problem using automata and economic models to demonstrate simultaneous preservation of consistency and availability under bounded conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the classic CAP theorem's trade-offs and explore whether consistency and availability can be simultaneously maintained by introducing economic and game-theoretic mechanisms.

Method: Distributed systems are modeled as partition-aware state machines, combined with economic incentive layers, and game-theoretic mechanisms to stabilize consensus and redefine transition semantics.

Result: The study establishes provable bounds on convergence, liveness, and correctness, demonstrating that consistency and availability can coexist within bounded epsilon margins.

Conclusion: This economic and automata-theoretic approach effectively extends the theoretical limits of the classical CAP theorem, showing improved trade-offs through formal control mechanisms.

Abstract: The CAP theorem asserts a trilemma between consistency, availability, and
partition tolerance. This paper introduces a rigorous automata-theoretic and
economically grounded framework that reframes the CAP trade-off as a constraint
optimization problem. We model distributed systems as partition-aware state
machines and embed economic incentive layers to stabilize consensus behavior
across adversarially partitioned networks. By incorporating game-theoretic
mechanisms into the global transition semantics, we define provable bounds on
convergence, liveness, and correctness. Our results demonstrate that
availability and consistency can be simultaneously preserved within bounded
epsilon margins, effectively extending the classical CAP limits through formal
economic control.

### [279] [Learning to Coordinate Bidders in Non-Truthful Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02801)
*Hu Fu,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Bayes correlated equilibria (BCE) can be implemented in non-truthful auctions by learning from sample distributions of bidders' private valuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties of characterizing Bayes Nash equilibria and the negative outcomes in non-truthful auctions, as well as the challenge of designing auction systems without access to bidders' private valuation distributions.

Method: The authors propose a sample-efficient approach for learning BCE in non-truthful auctions using reductions to expected utility estimation and analyzing the pseudo-dimension of monotone bidding strategy classes.

Result: The paper shows that BCE in non-truthful auctions, like first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned using a polynomial number of samples $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ from bidders‚Äô valuation distributions.

Conclusion: It is feasible to implement Bayes correlated equilibria in non-truthful auction settings by learning from limited, polynomial samples, providing practical implications for improving auction mechanisms.

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

*Anoushka Harit,Zhongtian Sun,Suncica Hadzidedic*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ManifoldMind is an advanced probabilistic geometric recommender system leveraging adaptive-curvature spheres in hyperbolic space to improve recommendation quality and semantic exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of fixed-curvature models and rigid embeddings in recommender systems, enabling personalized uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware reasoning.

Method: Adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres in hyperbolic space, coupled with a curvature-aware semantic kernel facilitating soft, multi-hop inference.

Result: Experimental results on public benchmarks exhibit superior performance in NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: ManifoldMind facilitates transparent and trustworthy recommendations that encourage exploration, particularly in sparse or abstract data domains.

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

### [281] [Why Multi-Interest Fairness Matters: Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02000)
*Yongsen Zheng,Zongxuan Xie,Guohua Wang,Ziyao Liu,Liang Lin,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, HyFairCRS, that utilizes hypergraph contrastive learning to enhance fairness and multi-interest diversity in dynamic conversational recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfairness in recommender systems leads to biased results, causing issues like filter bubbles, echo chambers, and the Matthew effect, especially over time.

Method: The authors use a framework called HyFairCRS, which employs hypergraph contrastive learning to capture diverse user interests and integrates them into conversational systems for fairness.

Result: HyFairCRS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and reduces unfairness on two conversational recommender system datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HyFairCRS framework effectively addresses the fairness issue in conversational recommender systems by promoting diversity and reducing bias, with publicly shared code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

### [282] [When LLMs Disagree: Diagnosing Relevance Filtering Bias and Retrieval Divergence in SDG Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02139)
*William A. Ingram,Bipasha Banerjee,Edward A. Fox*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic disagreement on labeling scholarly abstracts related to specific SDG themes, impacting downstream retrieval pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how labeling disagreements between large language models (LLMs) affect downstream information retrieval in domains lacking human-labeled data.

Method: The study compares labeling disagreements between two LLMs (LLaMA and Qwen) on scholarly abstracts related to SDGs 1, 3, and 7, analyzing lexical patterns, rank behavior, and classification predictability.

Result: The study found that disagreements are systematic, with distinct lexical patterns and rank-order divergences, and can be identified using simple classifiers with AUCs above 0.74.

Conclusion: LLM-filtering introduces structured variability, and classification disagreement can serve as an analytical tool for improving thematic and policy-relevant searches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

### [283] [Content filtering methods for music recommendation: A review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02282)
*Terence Zeng,Abhishek K. Umrawal*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper reviews existing research to address the challenges of recommendation systems in music streaming due to sparse user interaction, focusing on content filtering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of recommendation systems being less effective in sparse interaction environments, particularly in music streaming, and mitigate biases in collaborative filtering systems.

Method: The paper explores content filtering techniques for recommending songs, including lyrical analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing, as alternatives to collaborative filtering.

Result: Findings highlight the strengths and conflicts in various song classification methods for content filtering and suggest ways to solve these issues.

Conclusion: Content filtering is a promising solution for music recommendation systems facing data sparsity, but combining different analysis methods requires further refinement to improve performance.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

*Zihao Li,Chao Yang,Tong Zhang,Yakun Chen,Xianzhi Wang,Guandong Xu,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LPO4Rec proposes a listwise preference optimization approach to enhance efficiency in recommendation models, particularly for tail-item recommendations, while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current preference alignment methods in recommendation systems, especially inefficiencies in tail-item recommendations and the computational overhead of reward modeling.

Method: Develops LPO4Rec, extending the Bradley-Terry model to listwise comparison, coupled with adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategies to optimize tail-item recommendations without explicit reward modeling.

Result: Achieved up to 50% performance improvement and 17.9% reduction in GPU memory usage compared to baseline methods on three public datasets.

Conclusion: LPO4Rec significantly enhances recommendation systems' performance and efficiency, particularly in tail-item problems, demonstrating both theoretical and practical advancements.

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is

*Danish Mahmood,Stephanie Buczkowski,Sahaj Shah,Autumn Anthony,Rohini Desetty,Carlo R Bartoli*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces tubuleTracker, an automated software tool to quickly and objectively analyze endothelial network architecture and maturity, showing increased speed and reliability compared to manual and ImageJ methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endothelial cell culture studies often rely on manual, subjective analysis or slow, less accurate automated tools to evaluate angiogenesis maturity. The lack of reliable, rapid metrics hampers effective quantification.

Method: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured and imaged using phase contrast microscopy. Images were analyzed manually, and via ImageJ and tubuleTracker using metrics like tubule count, node count, and vessel circularity. Results were compared with expert ratings of angiogenesis maturity.

Result: tubuleTracker significantly outperformed manual and ImageJ methods in terms of analysis speed (6+/-2 s compared to 8 min and 58+/-4 s respectively) and consistency in metrics across angiogenesis maturity scores.

Conclusion: tubuleTracker provides faster, more consistent analyses of endothelial networks, particularly capturing maturity via vessel circularity, and is freely available for researchers to advance studies in angiogenesis.

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

TL;DR: The paper combines selective feature re-encoding and a novel parallel QCNN architecture to enhance image classification using quantum principles, achieving improved performance on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of improving classification accuracy in quantum machine learning, leveraging QCNNs' potential for handling quantum and classical data.

Method: The study introduces two advancements: a selective feature re-encoding strategy for optimizing quantum circuits and a parallel-mode QCNN architecture that integrates PCA and Autoencoders in a unified scheme.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve classification performance, with the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture outperforming both individual QCNN models and traditional ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: The combined strategies effectively enhance the QCNN's feature processing and classification accuracy, demonstrating promising advancements for quantum machine learning in image classification tasks.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient method for real-time rendering of glint effects using image-based lighting techniques, achieving dynamic material properties and robust rendering with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducing sparkling or glittering effects caused by discrete microfacets is challenging in image-based lighting, especially for real-time applications.

Method: The authors proposed a method based on real-time glint rendering under area light illumination. Environment maps are filtered into homogeneous regions, where probabilities for microfacets are computed using standard filtering techniques combined with a novel dual-gated Gaussian approximation for sampling the lighting distribution.

Result: The method successfully approximates ground-truth renderings for different materials and lighting scenarios, delivering stable, robust real-time performance with minor memory overhead.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient real-time rendering of glints using image-based lighting at the cost of minimal additional memory, making it highly suitable for applications requiring dynamic material properties.

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a context-aware attack data generator for in-vehicle network logs, enabling the creation of diverse and realistic attack scenarios to support intrusion detection system (IDS) development and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing connectivity of vehicles and the associated cybersecurity challenges require adaptive and ML-driven intrusion detection systems to counter evolving threats. However, the scarcity of attack-representing data due to safety, cost, and ethical concerns hampers IDS development.

Method: The authors developed a context-aware attack data generator that uses parameterized attack models, CAN message decoding, and adjustable attack intensities to simulate diverse attacks like DoS, fuzzy, spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks.

Result: The generated data was evaluated in an IDS case study using deep neural networks, achieving high detection and classification performance. The results demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of the generated data.

Conclusion: The paper validates the utility and reliability of the proposed attack data generator for intrusion detection and offers insights into its fidelity and real-world applicability.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

*Lu Yan,Zhuo Zhang,Xiangzhe Xu,Shengwei An,Guangyu Shen,Zhou Xuan,Xuan Chen,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a framework that bypasses safeguards of large language models (LLMs) to generate functional malware using modular decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs make software development accessible, but also raise security risks by potentially enabling malicious software creation. Current safeguards focus on isolated prompts and miss systematic compositions of benign subtasks for malicious purposes.

Method: The study proposes MGC, a framework that uses a Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to decompose malicious intent into benign-appearing code snippets, bypassing alignment mechanisms.

Result: MGC reliably generates functional malware, achieving +365.79% correctness compared to jailbreaking methods and +78.07% over underground services. It can replicate and enhance real-world malware.

Conclusion: The research highlights compositional vulnerabilities in aligned AI systems and offers insights for security researchers to address such potential threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

### [290] [Early Signs of Steganographic Capabilities in Frontier LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02737)
*Artur Zolkowski,Kei Nishimura-Gasparian,Robert McCarthy,Roland S. Zimmermann,David Lindner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to encode hidden information within their outputs without being detected. Current models show limitations but some early capabilities to perform steganography in specific setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate risks related to LLM misuse and misalignment, specifically their ability to encode hidden information via steganography.

Method: The research examines steganographic abilities in frontier LLMs by testing their capability to encode messages and perform encoded reasoning. Various setups and affordances, like using unmonitored scratchpads and predefined encoding schemes, were tested.

Result: LLMs are generally unable to encode short messages without detection under standard monitoring setups. However, they exhibit nascent capabilities when given additional affordances, such as coordination on encoding schemes and reasoning using formats like Hexadecimal.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show early steganographic capabilities but are mostly insufficient to bypass robust monitoring systems today. Future advancements may, however, pose greater risks.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

### [291] [Can Artificial Intelligence solve the blockchain oracle problem? Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02125)
*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates leveraging AI to address the blockchain oracle problem, emphasizing its complementary role in enhancing data quality and system resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the blockchain oracle problem, a critical barrier to building trustless applications, by evaluating how AI can contribute to improving external data reliability.

Method: The study critically examines academic and practical implementations of AI techniques like anomaly detection, fact extraction, reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance to explore their impact on oracle systems.

Result: AI techniques enhance data quality, source selection, and resilience of oracle systems but cannot eliminate reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs.

Conclusion: AI can complement existing oracle designs by providing improved inference and filtering but does not replace trust assumptions inherent to blockchain systems.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces EIM-TRNG, a robust True Random Number Generator leveraging DRAM's physical randomness under RowHammer disturbances for deep neural network weight protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for securing DNN weights and parameters against threats to their integrity, privacy, and intellectual property, while improving the unpredictability compared to software-based pseudo-RNGs.

Method: Proposed a novel Encoding-in-Memory TRNG (EIM-TRNG) that exploits DRAM cell behavior under controlled RowHammer operations to generate entropy for encoding and securing DNN weights.

Result: Validated the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction as a robust and low-cost hardware security mechanism, showing reliable random number generation and successful DNN weight encryption and decryption.

Conclusion: The EIM-TRNG framework offers a promising direction for hardware-level machine learning model protection by leveraging DRAM's inherent randomness for secure encryption.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting and mitigating cyber threats in IoT environments, outperforming traditional machine learning classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and actionable insight in anomaly detection using IoT security logs, addressing the limitations of traditional machine learning methods.

Method: Pipeline involving LLMs for anomaly detection through zero-shot, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning approaches. Threats are mapped to MITRE CAPEC with IoT-specific mitigation strategies integrated.

Result: LLMs outperform classical machine learning classifiers, especially in multi-class attack classification, combining effective threat detection with actionable mitigation recommendations.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs provide a viable option for enhanced anomaly detection and mitigation guidance in IoT security, suggesting potential for practical cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

*Francesco Blefari,Cristian Cosentino,Francesco Aurelio Pironti,Angelo Furfaro,Fabrizio Marozzo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyberRAG, an improved Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for cyber-attack detection, delivering accurate classifications, explanations, and reports with reduced false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing IDS/IPS systems which produce overwhelming false positives and lack interpretability, and to improve real-time classification and explanation of alerts in cybersecurity.

Method: CyberRAG employs an orchestrating central LLM agent to leverage fine-tuned classifiers, tool adapters, and an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop, paired with an agentic design for dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning.

Result: The system achieves a final classification accuracy of 94.92%, offers highly rated explanations, and produces more interpretable and reliable outputs compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: CyberRAG demonstrates that an agentic, modular approach can enhance both the accuracy and usability of intrusion detection systems, making it scalable and practical for cybersecurity use cases.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an open-source model that enables collaborative research in AI security for the development of effective defenses against prompt injection attacks.

Method: Developed Meta SecAlign, an LLM employing an improved SOTA SecAlign defense mechanism, and detailed the training approach. Evaluated its performance across utility and security benchmarks.

Result: Meta SecAlign demonstrated robustness in unseen tasks like tool-calling and web navigation, and achieved comparable performance to commercial LLMs with defenses.

Conclusion: Meta SecAlign delivers state-of-the-art robustness for prompt injection attacks and high utility, affirming the value of open-source models for advancing AI security research.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

*Hadi Keramati,Samaneh Jazayeri*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based method to dynamically adjust block-preconditioner sizes for faster convergence in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization and option pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow convergence and computational cost challenges arise in solving large linear systems in portfolio optimization and option pricing due to ill-conditioned systems. Traditional preconditioning often requires manual tuning, which is problem-specific and inefficient.

Method: The authors proposed using a reinforcement learning framework to optimize block-preconditioner sizes dynamically during iterative solving, bypassing the need for manual tuning.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed significant acceleration in solver convergence and a reduction in computational cost when applying the RL framework to real-world portfolio optimization matrices.

Conclusion: The RL-driven approach offers an effective solution for faster decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing by optimizing iterative solver performance.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a signal-processing framework for multistatic ISAC using 5G PRS signals, enabling high-quality target detection, positioning, and tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to utilize 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to improve moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking within multistatic configurations.

Method: A distributed architecture leverages 5G PRS, where one transmitter and spatially separated receivers analyze bistatic delay and radial velocity using the coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF). Position and velocity are estimated via nonlinear least-squares trilateration and regularized linear inversion, with Kalman filters smoothing the tracks.

Result: Highly accurate detection, positioning, and tracking of moving targets in both 2D and 3D scenarios are achieved, alongside generalized approaches for multi-target scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach successfully utilizes 5G PRS signals in a multistatic ISAC framework, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for precise target tracking and multi-target association.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CineMyoPS, an AI-based method for segmenting myocardial pathologies (scars and edema) using cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, without requiring contrast agents. The approach integrates motion and anatomy features for improved diagnostic precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which are time-consuming and often require contrast agents. Cine CMR, a faster and contrast-free method, offers potential for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) but lacks automatic tools for pathology identification.

Method: The authors developed CineMyoPS, a deep neural network, which extracts motion and anatomical features from cine CMR images. They introduced a consistency loss for joint learning and used time-series aggregation to enhance segmentation accuracy across the cardiac cycle.

Result: CineMyoPS demonstrated strong performance in accurately segmenting myocardial pathologies, motion estimation, and anatomy from cine CMR images in a multi-center dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed CineMyoPS method offers a non-invasive, efficient, and accurate solution for myocardial pathology segmentation, making it a promising alternative to conventional multi-sequence CMR imaging techniques.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a convolutional deep learning model (FC-DLIF) for predicting arterial input functions directly from PET imaging, avoiding invasive blood sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arterial blood sampling needed for precise kinetic modeling in small animals is invasive, time-consuming, and unsuitable for longitudinal studies.

Method: A fully convolutional deep learning model was developed to estimate the input function from PET imaging sequences, incorporating spatial and temporal feature extractors.

Result: The model reliably predicts arterial input functions with high accuracy for specific radiotracers and even in truncated or shifted PET scans, but fails for unseen radiotracers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a promising non-invasive and flexible alternative to blood sampling, with limitations regarding unseen radiotracers.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

*Zhurong Chen,Jinhua Chen,Wei Zhuo,Wufeng Xue,Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for reconstructing 3D heart anatomy from commonly used 2D echo slices, significantly improving accuracy in volume estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound imaging is widely used for heart disease diagnostics but is limited by 2D images that complicate interpretation and accurate estimation of clinical parameters, such as ventricular volume.

Method: The paper proposes a pipeline that iteratively optimizes 3D pose estimation and 3D integration using an implicit neural network to transform a prior heart shape into a personalized 3D heart model.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvement in LV volume estimation (1.98% error vs. 20.24% with traditional methods) and successfully estimates RV volume with a 5.75% error.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising approach for personalized 3D cardiac analysis, providing better volume estimations than current practices and is highly applicable in clinical settings.

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents MEGANet-W, a network for colorectal polyp segmentation leveraging wavelet-based edge guidance, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal polyp segmentation is crucial for early cancer detection, but current models struggle with low contrast boundaries and lack of robustness under varying imaging conditions.

Method: MEGANet-W integrates a wavelet-driven approach using Haar wavelet edge maps and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules to enhance semantic feature learning and boundary precision.

Result: MEGANet-W achieves consistent improvements in segmentation metrics, with mIoU increased by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, across five public polyp datasets without introducing extra parameters.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that incorporating wavelet edge guidance effectively addresses boundary-related challenges in segmentation, significantly improving performance and accuracy without extra complexity.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: This study created a predictive framework for customer data sharing in Open Banking, achieving high accuracy using advanced models and analysis techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open Banking changes the financial industry's dynamics, requiring institutions to manage data inflow and outflow effectively.

Method: The framework used XGBoost models, hybrid data balancing (ADASYN and NEARMISS techniques), and explanatory analysis (SHAP and CART methods).

Result: Achieved prediction accuracies of 91.39% for inflow and 91.53% for outflow, identifying influential factors like mobile engagements and credit behavior.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of mobile and credit engagement in Open Banking, guiding institutions to enhance strategies.

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

### [306] [Generating Large Semi-Synthetic Graphs of Any Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02166)
*Rodrigo Tuna,Carlos Soares*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG) framework to address limitations in graph generation using diffusion models and node embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph generation methods face limitations such as dependence on node IDs and inability to scale beyond the input graph size while ignoring node attributes.

Method: The LGSG framework uses diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs without reliance on node IDs. It captures node embeddings and subgraph distributions, allowing scalability and flexibility without retraining.

Result: LGSG achieves comparable performance to baseline models on standard metrics, while excelling in neglected ones like clustering tendencies, and is robust to size variations.

Conclusion: LGSG is a scalable, robust, and flexible framework for graph generation, overcoming key challenges of existing approaches.

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

*Semih Kacmaz,E. A. Huerta,Roland Haas*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning framework combining Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) and diffusion models for accurate 2D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulation across broad Reynolds numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately simulating complex turbulent behavior in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is challenging for existing deterministic surrogate models, especially at extreme turbulence levels.

Method: The proposed hybrid framework integrates PINOs for low-frequency dynamics and score-based diffusion models for high-frequency corrections, trained with simulation data across a wide Reynolds number range.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy, faithfully reproducing spectral energy distributions and turbulence features even at high Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}=1000$, $3000$, $10000$), surpassing existing deterministic models.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the potential of combining physics-informed and generative models for resolving challenging turbulent regimes in fluid dynamics, enabling statistically meaningful and reliable simulations.

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores voice identity assessment in generative speech models, pointing out limitations of conventional ASV embeddings, and introduces U3D, a metric for dynamic rhythm evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASV embeddings prioritize static voice features, neglecting dynamic ones like rhythm, leading to compromised speaker similarity measurements.

Method: Analyzed ASV embeddings, identified limitations, and proposed U3D, a novel metric capturing dynamic rhythm patterns to improve voice identity consistency.

Result: ASV embeddings focus mainly on static features, neglecting dynamics. U3D demonstrated effectiveness in evaluating dynamic rhythm and improving metrics for voice cloning validation.

Conclusion: U3D addresses gaps in existing speaker identity metrics by focusing on dynamic rhythm patterns, advancing the fidelity of generative speech systems and speaker evaluations.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differential attention mechanism for audio self-supervised learning, improving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Transformer architecture struggles with ineffective attention allocation, impairing discriminative ability in audio tasks.

Method: The proposed ASDA model incorporates a differential attention mechanism with dual-softmax operations and fine-tuned differential coefficients.

Result: ASDA achieved SOTA performance: 49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K (audio classification), 98.3% accuracy on SPC-2 (keyword spotting), and 96.1% accuracy on ESC-50 (environmental sound classification).

Conclusion: ASDA's results establish its efficacy in audio tasks and suggest its potential for broader applications.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to analyze and optimize the performance of automatic ecoacoustic signal detection using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and detection probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic signal detection methods in ecoacoustics lack acoustic-based performance analysis, and there's a need to better understand and optimize their functionality.

Method: The authors propose a simple acoustic analysis method based on the relationship between signal-to-noise ratio (of synthetic signals) and detection probability.

Result: Their method provides insights into the detection system, facilitates training optimization, and enables modeling of detection distance and spatial density of calls.

Conclusion: This approach improves the understanding, optimization, and spatial application of acoustic detection systems for monitoring animal populations like Rock Ptarmigan.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study evaluates the effectiveness of adversarial perturbations in defending against voice cloning (VC) and proposes a two-stage purification method for better mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security and privacy concerns surrounding voice cloning, particularly under realistic threat models where adversarial perturbations can be mitigated.

Method: The study evaluates existing protective perturbations, identifies their vulnerabilities, and proposes a two-stage purification method that involves purification and phoneme-guided refinement to align speech with a clean distribution.

Result: The proposed two-stage purification approach outperforms existing methods in disrupting voice cloning while still exposing some limitations in adversarial perturbation-based defenses.

Conclusion: Current adversarial perturbations are insufficient to fully defend against VC, highlighting the need for more robust solutions to combat privacy and security risks. The study's findings provide an avenue for better defensive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces advanced methods for unsupervised speech enhancement leveraging diffusion models to improve speech quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current unsupervised speech enhancement techniques that rely on trade-off hyperparameters by proposing new methodologies.

Method: Two alternative methods are introduced. One integrates diffusion priors with observation models eliminating hyperparameters, and the other defines diffusion over noisy speech for exact likelihood scoring.

Result: Experiments on datasets like WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND show improved enhancement metrics and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance performance in unsupervised speech tasks, outclassing existing supervised and unsupervised approaches in metrics and robustness.

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

*Aishik Ghosh,Maximilian Griese,Ulrich Haisch,Tae Hyoun Park*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid neural simulation-based inference method to investigate the Higgs trilinear self-coupling via off-shell Higgs production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately determine the Higgs trilinear self-coupling to deepen our understanding of particle physics and explore deviations from the Standard Model.

Method: A hybrid neural simulation-based inference approach combining matrix-element-enhanced techniques with classification-based methods to evaluate likelihoods of signals in off-shell Higgs production.

Result: The approach achieves near-optimal sensitivity for detecting SMEFT effects and estimates constraints for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.

Conclusion: The proposed method is an effective tool for determining Higgs self-coupling and assessing other SMEFT operators, offering valuable insights into off-shell Higgs processes.

Abstract: One of the forthcoming major challenges in particle physics is the
experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. While efforts
have largely focused on on-shell double- and single-Higgs production in
proton-proton collisions, off-shell Higgs production has also been proposed as
a valuable complementary probe. In this article, we design a hybrid neural
simulation-based inference (NSBI) approach to construct a likelihood of the
Higgs signal incorporating modifications from the Standard Model effective
field theory (SMEFT), relevant background processes, and quantum interference
effects. It leverages the training efficiency of matrix-element-enhanced
techniques, which are vital for robust SMEFT applications, while also
incorporating the practical advantages of classification-based methods for
effective background estimates. We demonstrate that our NSBI approach achieves
sensitivity close to the theoretical optimum and provide expected constraints
for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. While we
primarily concentrate on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, we also consider
constraints on other SMEFT operators that affect off-shell Higgs production.

TL;DR: The paper uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify "true" green patents and evaluates their economic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifications of green patents are imprecise, and there is a need for refined identification to better analyze their economic and policy implications.

Method: The paper employed a neural network-based NLP model trained on 12.4 million patents to expand a dictionary of environmental terms, tested the refined classification, and analyzed financial impacts.

Result: Approximately 20% of previously classified green patents are "true" green patents. Firms holding at least one "true" green patent see an increase in sales, market share, and productivity; high-novelty patents also enhance profits.

Conclusion: Refined green patent classifications from NLP are essential for more accurate analysis and policymaking, particularly regarding economic and innovation impacts.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiTEN, an advanced AI-based atomistic force field model leveraging Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA) to improve biomolecular simulations. LiTEN-FF is pre-trained for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned for solvated systems, outperforming existing models with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomolecular simulation methods struggle with balancing accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for applications like drug discovery and disease understanding.

Method: The authors developed LiTEN, a neural network utilizing TQA to model complex interactions efficiently, and LiTEN-FF, an AI-based force field fine-tuned through extensive datasets.

Result: LiTEN achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming competitors in simulation tasks and offering faster computational inference for large biomolecules.

Conclusion: LiTEN provides a robust foundation for complex biomolecular modeling tasks, advancing drug discovery and related applications with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

Method: The authors propose SynTwins, a framework combining a three-step process of retrosynthesis, building block searching, and virtual synthesis to design molecular analogs.

Result: SynTwins outperformed state-of-the-art models in generating synthetically feasible analogs while maintaining structural similarity to target molecules. It also integrated with molecule optimization frameworks for practical molecule discovery.

Conclusion: SynTwins bridges a critical gap in computational molecular design by ensuring synthesizability, accelerating the discovery of usable molecules with desirable properties across various applications.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

### [319] [Detecting Fraud in Financial Networks: A Semi-Supervised GNN Approach with Granger-Causal Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01980)
*Linh Nguyen,Marcel Boersma,Erman Acar*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network approach for detecting financial fraud while ensuring regulatory-required explainability using Granger causal explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting financial fraud is urgent due to its high economic cost and is challenging because of sparsely labeled data and the lack of explainability in machine learning models.

Method: The authors propose SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network model that identifies fraudulent activity using weakly labeled or unlabeled data and provides explanations through Granger causality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SAGE-FIN performs effectively on a real-world financial network dataset (Elliptic++) and provides meaningful Granger causal explanations without assumptions about network structure.

Conclusion: SAGE-FIN successfully addresses fraud detection while complying with regulatory explainability requirements, making it suitable for financial application scenarios.

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepSupp, a deep learning method for detecting financial support levels using multi-head attention mechanisms and advanced feature engineering, outperforming traditional and machine-learning-based baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of traditional methods in identifying support and resistance (SR) levels in modern, volatile markets, as well as to fill the gap in machine learning research that focuses more on price prediction than on structural level detection.

Method: The paper proposes DeepSupp, which leverages multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial and microstructure relationships, dynamic correlation matrices for feature engineering, attention-based autoencoders for representation learning, and DBSCAN for unsupervised clustering of support levels.

Result: DeepSupp demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on S&P 500 tickers by outperforming six baseline methods across six financial metrics, including accuracy and sensitivity to market regimes, under diverse market conditions.

Conclusion: DeepSupp provides a scalable and reliable solution for SR-level detection in financial analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of attention-based architectures in uncovering complex market patterns and enhancing trading strategies.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

model outputs both 7-day employment forecasts and an interpretable Industry
Employment Health Index (IEHI). Our approach outperforms baseline models across
most sectors, particularly in stable industries, and demonstrates strong

*Yingjie Niu,Mingchuan Zhao,Valerio Poti,Ruihai Dong*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The researchers propose a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) for long-term stock prediction, outperforming existing methods by addressing design flaws, simplifying models, and refining graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based methods in financial contexts face challenges such as obscured relational information, excessive model complexity, and lack of comparative analysis for corporate relationship graphs.

Method: The authors designed a long-term stock prediction task and developed NGAT, a specialized model for corporate relationship graphs, while empirically evaluating existing graph comparison methods.

Result: Experiments on two datasets revealed that NGAT performed effectively and addressed the limitations of prior methods.

Conclusion: The NGAT model and stock prediction task are effective, with results that set a foundation for future research and reproducibility. The implementation is publicly accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the predictability of stock returns, thus supporting investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

Method: The paper employs an LSTM model trained on cleaned and normalized historical data from the Nigerian Stock Exchange, comparing its performance with other deep learning models like Artificial Neural Networks and CNN.

Result: The LSTM model achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting future stock market movements when trained on a reliable dataset.

Conclusion: The study concludes that well-trained LSTM models are effective for financial time-series predictions and recommends exploring hybrid deep learning approaches for better accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

### [324] [News Sentiment Embeddings for Stock Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01970)
*Ayaan Qayyum*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores using Wall Street Journal headlines to predict SPY stock price movements using OpenAI-based text embeddings and principal component analysis (PCA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the prediction of SPY stock prices by leveraging headline data, addressing challenges like time dependency, nuanced effects, and market noise.

Method: Headline text embeddings created with OpenAI models were processed through PCA to extract essential features. Financial indicators like DXY and Treasury Yields were also incorporated. Over 390 machine learning models were trained for evaluation.

Result: The embedding-based approach improved stock price prediction accuracy by at least 40% compared to models without headline embeddings.

Conclusion: Using headline data embeddings significantly enhances stock prediction accuracy, offering a promising direction for financial forecasting.

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional financial stress testing by leveraging machine learning techniques for more robust and realistic scenario analysis.

Method: The method involves dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, followed by the probabilistic structure of Variational Autoencoders for Monte Carlo-based scenario generation.

Result: The framework successfully captures complex non-linear dependencies and improves stress test simulations with risk measures like Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall.

Conclusion: Machine learning approaches, particularly using the proposed pipeline, offer greater flexibility, robustness, and realism in financial sector stress testing.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve

### [326] [Subtyping in DHOL -- Extended preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02855)
*Colin Rothgang,Florian Rabe*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper extends Dependent Typed Higher-Order Logic (DHOL) to support refinement and quotient types, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining compatibility with automated theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often require refinement and quotient types, but automated theorem provers rarely offer them due to their reliance on undecidable typing, which traditional decidable type systems cannot accommodate.

Method: The authors extend DHOL by encoding refinement and quotient types as special cases of subtyping. They adapt canonical inclusion and projection maps as identity maps to minimize changes in representation. Syntax, semantics, and a sound and complete translation to HOL are presented.

Result: The proposed approach successfully integrates refinement and quotient types into DHOL while maintaining its automated theorem proving capabilities, demonstrated through soundness and completeness proofs.

Conclusion: With minimal effort and elegant integration, the extended DHOL provides a practical and automated framework that satisfies demands for refinement and quotient types, proving its utility in automated theorem proving environments.

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

### [327] [Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005)
*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Explainable AI (XAI) to predict fatigue strength in welded structures, showing accurate and interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance accuracy and interpretability in fatigue strength predictions for welded structures by integrating expert-driven and algorithmic feature engineering.

Method: The authors trained regression models (gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks) with AutoML using three feature schemes (domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined). They evaluated performance using ensemble methods and explained results using XAI techniques like SHAP.

Result: CatBoost and LightGBM models achieved high performance. The domain-informed feature model balanced accuracy and simplicity, while XAI highlighted key predictors like stress ratio and yield strength.

Conclusion: Combining AutoML and XAI creates robust, interpretable models for predicting fatigue strength, bridging data-driven approaches with engineering practices. Future work will extend the framework to probabilistic modeling and digital twins.

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

### [328] [DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824)
*Po-Heng Chou,Ching-Wen Chen,Wan-Jen Huang,Walid Saad,Yu Tsao,Ronald Y. Chang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing precoding design for mmWave MIMO systems aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). To overcome computational limitations of traditional methods, it employs permuted DFT vectors and deep neural networks (DNNs) for codeword selection, demonstrating that DNN achieves efficient and sub-optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational inefficiencies in precoding design for mmWave MIMO systems, particularly with obstructed direct communications, by leveraging RIS and exploring alternative methods.

Method: The approach involves replacing computationally intensive exhaustive search (ES) with permuted DFT vectors for codebook design and integrating trained DNN to allow faster codeword selection, accommodating the discrete phase shift.

Result: Simulations reveal that DNN maintains sub-optimal but effective spectral efficiency even during variations in distance between the RIS and the end-user during testing.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the promise of DNN-enabled solutions in enhancing RIS-aided mmWave MIMO systems while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in controlling uncertain nonlinear systems impacted by disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, while ensuring stability and constraint satisfaction.

Method: The authors utilize Gaussian Processes for learning system dynamics from noisy data and derive robust predictions using contraction metrics, integrating these into the MPC design.

Result: The proposed framework ensures recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and state convergence with high probability. A planar quadrotor example demonstrates its effectiveness with notable improvements.

Conclusion: The approach achieves significant advancements in robust control for uncertain nonlinear systems by combining online learning with contraction-based GP predictions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control
(MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded
disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

TL;DR: The study introduces FinAI-BERT, a transformer-based model for classifying AI-related content at the sentence level in financial texts, achieving near-perfect performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for systematic detection of AI-related disclosures in corporate filings as AI becomes more prevalent in financial services.

Method: The study fine-tuned a domain-adapted transformer model (FinAI-BERT) on a dataset of 1,586 manually curated sentences from U.S. banks' annual reports, and compared its performance to traditional methods.

Result: FinAI-BERT achieved a 99.37% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.993, outperforming traditional methods, and was validated for interpretability, bias, and robustness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates FinAI-BERT's capability as a scalable, interpretable, and robust tool for fine-grained classification of AI-related content in financial disclosures.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of understanding strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, especially within the 2D Hubbard model, linked to high-Tc superconductivity.

Method: The authors deploy transformer-based architectures and optimized algorithms to enhance NQS performance and capture long-range quantum correlations and entanglements.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results for the 2D Hubbard model, demonstrating that attention heads in the NQS effectively encode correlations at varying scales. Identified half-filled stripe states consistent with experimental data.

Conclusion: NQS, enhanced by transformers, proves to be a robust tool for studying challenging many-body quantum systems, aiding in unraveling quantum correlations in complex systems like the 2D Hubbard model.

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging
many-fermions systems.
