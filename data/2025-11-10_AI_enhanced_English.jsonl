To address these issues, we\npropose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating\nreverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our\napproach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting\na comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant\nelements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine\ndiagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with\nfew-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and\nmaintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation.\nThis methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent\ncapability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the\nreliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex\nsoftware behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge\nthrough few-shot prompting.
