### [1] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified automation framework combining symbolic reasoning and adaptive control using large language models (LLMs), with successful results across fault scenarios and process control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern chemical processes face challenges such as increasing complexity, workforce shortages, and intricate fault scenarios, necessitating innovative automation solutions.

Method: The paper introduces an LLM-based framework employing Finite State Machines (FSMs) for fault recovery and process control. The process involves planning agents, simulated execution, and iterative validation-reprompting loops.

Result: Case studies show 100% success rates in fault recovery and comparable performance to traditional controllers in continuous process control, emphasizing the importance of structured feedback loops.

Conclusion: LLMs, when combined with modular agents and structured feedback, can advance chemical process automation by integrating high-level symbolic planning with low-level continuous control.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

### [2] [BOOST: Out-of-Distribution-Informed Adaptive Sampling for Bias Mitigation in Stylistic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07134)
*Mridula Vijendran,Shuang Chen,Jingjing Deng,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study addresses bias in AI art classification by introducing BOOST, a bias-mitigation approach, and evaluates it using KaoKore and PACS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in AI art classification, especially on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, compromises fairness and accuracy, necessitating robust mechanisms to handle imbalanced datasets and reduce predictive disparities.

Method: The authors propose BOOST, a Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning method, which dynamically adjusts temperature scaling and sampling probabilities to achieve equitable class representation.

Result: BOOST was tested on KaoKore and PACS datasets, showing effective class-wise bias reduction and improved fairness, alongside a new metric, SODC, for evaluating performance.

Conclusion: BOOST offers a robust, equitable solution to mitigate bias in AI art classification, balancing high performance with fairness and addressing challenges in imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

### [3] [State-Inference-Based Prompting for Natural Language Trading with Game NPCs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07203)
*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Hwidong Bae,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) improves the reliability of in-game trading systems by accurately managing dialogue states, addressing rule violations like hallucinated items or calculation errors in dynamic game environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in adhering to the rules of game trading systems, leading to player trust concerns due to inaccuracies like rule violations, hallucinations, and calculation errors.

Method: The paper introduces a State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) approach that organizes trading as six dialogue states, allowing autonomous state inference and customized rule adherence. It incorporates context-aware item management and placeholder-based price calculations.

Result: SIBP achieved over 97% state compliance, 95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7% precision in calculations during 100 trading dialogues. It also showed computational efficiency and better performance compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: SIBP is effective for managing rule-based trading in gaming contexts, offering a reliable and computationally efficient solution. This enhances trustworthiness and usability in NPC interactions for commercial games.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

### [4] [Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217)
*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of analyzing illicit activities in supply chains using neurosymbolic methods, emphasizing sparse and unreliable data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in detecting illicit activities in supply chains, where data is sparse and often corrupted.

Method: The authors propose a neurosymbolic approach and a question tree method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated feature extraction and classification.

Result: The methods facilitate a comparison between human and machine classification of news articles related to forced labor in supply chains, improving systematic evaluation.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic systems and a structured question tree approach can effectively identify patterns of illicit activities in supply chains, even with challenging datasets.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that automates a wide range of scientific research tasks without the need for human intervention.

Method: The system employs a multi-agent approach using 30 LLM agents, implementing a Planning & Control strategy to coordinate tasks like data retrieval, code writing, result interpretation, and critique.

Result: cmbagent successfully executed a PhD-level task and outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on benchmark tests.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential for multi-agent LLM systems to surpass human-in-the-loop methods in complex scientific tasks. It is accessible publicly for further research and deployment.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines using large-language models as expert planners to improve exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of efficient exploration in multi-agent environments, which are more complex than single-agent reinforcement learning.

Method: This work explores leveraging large-language models as expert planners to aid multi-agent systems in planning-based tasks.

Result: The investigation details how large-language models can improve exploration efficiency in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The use of large-language models shows promise as an effective tool for expert planning and efficient exploration in multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning
and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the
intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to
efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent
operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

### [7] [ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306)
*Yichen Lu,Wei Dai,Jiaen Liu,Ching Wing Kwok,Zongheng Wu,Xudong Xiao,Ao Sun,Sheng Fu,Jianyuan Zhan,Yian Wang,Takatomo Saito,Sicheng Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViDove is a multimodal translation agent system that integrates visual and contextual data for enhanced translation, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of text-only input in translation agents, aiming to mimic human workflows that rely on multimodal information.

Method: ViDove incorporates visual and contextual inputs, multimodal memory systems, and domain-specific long-short term memory modules for adaptive translation in real-world contexts.

Result: The system demonstrates a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% enhancement in SubER compared to state-of-the-art translation methods. Additionally, DoveBench benchmark was introduced.

Conclusion: ViDove exhibits improved translation quality and adaptability by leveraging multimodal data, and provides resources like DoveBench for further advancements in video subtitling and translation tasks.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

### [8] [On the Impossibility of Separating Intelligence from Judgment: The Computational Intractability of Filtering for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07341)
*Sarah Ball,Greg Gluch,Shafi Goldwasser,Frauke Kreuter,Omer Reingold,Guy N. Rothblum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the difficulty of designing filters to prevent misuse of large language models (LLMs) for harmful content due to inherent computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the misuse of LLMs for generating harmful content by exploring filters to prevent unsafe behavior.

Method: The study analyzes computational difficulties in both input and output filtering, proving cryptographic hardness assumptions and studying relaxed mitigation strategies.

Result: Finds that efficient filters for prompts and outputs are computationally infeasible and black-box filters are insufficient for ensuring safety.

Conclusion: Argues that true safety and alignment in AI systems require integrated judgment capabilities rather than relying on external filtering mechanisms.

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

### [9] [Supply Chain Optimization via Generative Simulation and Iterative Decision Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07355)
*Haoyue Bai,Haoyu Wang,Nanxu Gong,Xinyuan Wang,Wangyang Ying,Haifeng Chen,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an integrated framework called Sim-to-Dec for improving supply chain transportation decisions, emphasizing responsiveness and economic efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain transportation demands high responsiveness and economic efficiency, which can be enhanced through better shipping mode decisions.

Method: The proposed Sim-to-Dec framework integrates a generative simulation module utilizing autoregressive modeling and a dual-aware decision model optimized iteratively through simulator interactions.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show that Sim-to-Dec enhances delivery rates and profitability significantly.

Conclusion: The Sim-to-Dec framework is effective in addressing transportation strategy challenges and offers measurable improvements in supply chain performance.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

*Zerui Yang,Yuwei Wan,Yinqiao Li,Yudai Matsuda,Tong Xie,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents DrugMCTS, a method that integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search to improve drug repurposing results, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models in scientific reasoning, especially when reasoning goes beyond pretraining knowledge.

Method: The authors introduced DrugMCTS, incorporating retrieval-augmented generation, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search. Specialized agents analyze molecular and protein information iteratively without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: DrugMCTS enabled the model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by over 20%. Experiments on DrugBank and KIBA datasets showed superior recall and robustness compared to other LLMs and deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the significance of structured reasoning, collaboration, and feedback mechanisms for enhancing LLM-based drug discovery approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

*Weihao Tan,Changjiu Jiang,Yu Duan,Mingcong Lei,Jiageng Li,Yitian Hong,Xinrun Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo is a benchmark leveraging Stardew Valley to evaluate AI agents on tasks involving production and social interaction within a diverse environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously evaluate production capabilities and social interactions of AI agents.

Method: The researchers introduced StarDojo with 1,000 tasks across five domains and developed a compact subset for efficient evaluation of AI agents.

Result: GPT-4.1, the best-performing model tested, only achieved a 12.7% success rate, exposing challenges in multimodal reasoning and low-level skills.

Conclusion: StarDojo provides a valuable framework to advance AI agent development in complex, interactive simulations.

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

*Oliver Eberle,Thomas McGee,Hamza Giaffar,Taylor Webb,Ida Momennejad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AlgEval, a framework for analyzing the algorithms that large language models (LLMs) learn and use, emphasizing algorithmic primitives and composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding regarding the specific algorithms LLMs learn and use, amidst a focus on performance through scaling.

Method: The paper introduces AlgEval framework, utilizing top-down hypothesis formation and bottom-up circuit-level analysis to examine latent representations, attention, and computations in LLMs.

Result: A methodological case study reveals details about emergent search algorithms, demonstrating the feasibility of analyzing latent mechanisms in LLMs.

Conclusion: A systematic evaluation of algorithms in LLMs can provide interpretable insights into their reasoning processes, enabling more efficient training and novel architectures.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

*Mohamed Siala,Jordi Planes,Joao Marques-Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between explanations and issues in rule-based machine learning models, introducing algorithms to address these flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reliability of explanations provided by ML models, especially in high-risk domains, due to the potential consequences of incorrect explanations.

Method: Algorithms are developed to analyze and address undesired issues in rule-based ML models, such as negative overlap and redundancy.

Result: The study reveals that common tools for learning rule-based ML models generate rule sets with problematic facets.

Conclusion: Current rule-based ML methods are prone to producing flawed rule sets, indicating a need for improved algorithms and approaches in high-risk applications.

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

*Zhixiang Su,Di Wang,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Pooling, a novel technique to improve Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs), achieving state-of-the-art results in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited impact of vanilla aggregation in GNN-based models for link prediction in KGs and introduce a method for improved handling of query-specific graphs in inductive settings.

Method: The authors propose Context Pooling, which involves using graph pooling techniques and metrics like neighborhood precision and recall to identify logically relevant neighbors for link prediction. This method generates query-specific graphs for inductive tasks.

Result: Context Pooling demonstrated superior performance when applied to two state-of-the-art models across three public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in 42 of 48 test settings.

Conclusion: Context Pooling is a first-of-its-kind approach that enhances GNN-based models in KGs, offering improvements in performance and inductive reasoning by effectively leveraging logical relevance of neighboring nodes.

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of vaccine safety surveillance through automated data extraction from emergency department triage notes.

Method: The study used prompt engineering to create initial labeled datasets, confirmed by human annotators, and compared the performance of fine-tuned Llama 3.2 models, prompt-engineered models, and a rule-based approach.

Result: The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter model showed superior accuracy in extracting vaccine names and was deployable in resource-constrained settings due to model quantization.

Abstract: This study evaluates fine-tuned Llama 3.2 models for extracting
vaccine-related information from emergency department triage notes to support
near real-time vaccine safety surveillance. Prompt engineering was used to
initially create a labeled dataset, which was then confirmed by human
annotators. The performance of prompt-engineered models, fine-tuned models, and
a rule-based approach was compared. The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter
model outperformed other models in its accuracy of extracting vaccine names.
Model quantization enabled efficient deployment in resource-constrained
environments. Findings demonstrate the potential of large language models in
automating data extraction from emergency department notes, supporting
efficient vaccine safety surveillance and early detection of emerging adverse
events following immunization issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and robust uncertainty representation in credal networks, particularly in decision-making contexts that require conservative interval assessments.

Method: The framework utilizes belief and plausibility functions based on Dempster-Shafer theory, optimized for computational speed and robustness. It introduces formalized belief-based inference methods and compares them with classical sensitivity analysis.

Result: Numerical results illustrate the framework's practical utility, identifying both advantages and limitations, with insights for extending its application beyond chains to broader credal networks.

Conclusion: The proposed belief inference framework balances computational efficiency and robust uncertainty representation, offering a promising method for credal networks handling uncertainty in complex systems.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief
and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust
uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

### [17] [PlanQA: A Benchmark for Spatial Reasoning in LLMs using Structured Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07644)
*Fedor Rodionov,Abdelrahman Eldesokey,Michael Birsak,John Femiani,Bernard Ghanem,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanQA is a benchmark designed to test large-language models (LLMs) on spatial and geometric reasoning using symbolic representations of indoor layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and identify the capability of LLMs in reasoning about spatial and geometric constraints present in real-world settings.

Method: Developing PlanQA with structured indoor scene representations, diverse question types (metric/topological reasoning, design constraints), and testing LLMs under varied conditions.

Result: Current LLMs perform well in shallow queries but struggle with physical and spatial reasoning challenges, such as layout perturbations and coherence.

Conclusion: PlanQA reveals limitations in LLMs regarding spatial understanding, encouraging research towards models capable of reasoning in practical real-world layouts.

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

### [18] [Stable Preference Optimization for LLMs: A Bilevel Approach Beyond Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07723)
*Chengtao Jian,Kai Yang,Ye Ouyang,Xiaozhou Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can misallocate probability mass during model alignment, causing instability and bias. This paper proposes a stable preference optimization framework to address these issues, improving alignment and reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is empirically successful, its theoretical limitations and sensitivity to initialization are largely unexplored. Addressing these could improve language model alignment.

Method: Developed a bilevel optimization framework combining supervised fine-tuning with a regularized DPO objective. This method introduces stable preference optimization to minimize unintended biases and improve alignment dynamics.

Result: Experiments showed enhanced reasoning accuracy and better alignment of output distributions with intended human preferences, outperforming standard DPO methods.

Conclusion: The stable preference optimization framework mitigates key shortcomings of standard DPO, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for aligning language models with human preferences.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

### [19] [Identification of Violin Reduction via Contour Lines Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07743)
*Philémon Beghin,Anne-Emmanuelle Ceulemans,François Glineur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores a method to classify violins as reduced or non-reduced based on their contour line geometry using photogrammetry and regression-based features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been no quantitative study on how size reduction impacts the geometric characteristics of violins, especially contour lines, despite experts observing notable differences.

Method: 3D meshes of 25 violins were analyzed via photogrammetry, extracting contour lines fitted with parabola-like curves. Parameters like beta and alpha were analyzed with regression and classification techniques.

Result: Classification methods prove geometry-based differentiation between reduced and non-reduced violins is feasible, with beta being the most predictive parameter.

Conclusion: Violin size reduction impacts contour lines and can be quantitatively assessed, though a spectrum of transformations complicates classification for intermediate cases.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAI Benchmark, a framework measuring AI's alignment with human flourishing across seven well-being dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI systems based on holistic human well-being rather than technical capabilities or harm prevention.

Method: Development of FAI Benchmark, using 1,229 objective and subjective questions and scores evaluated by judge LLMs employing geometric mean scoring.

Result: Testing of 28 LLMs reveals a top score of 72/100, with gaps in dimensions like Faith & Spirituality, Character & Virtue, and Meaning & Purpose.

Conclusion: The FAI Benchmark offers a new perspective on AI evaluation, focusing on supporting human flourishing, shaping future AI development and ethics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

### [21] [MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Expert Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818)
*Lu Xu,Jiaqian Yu,Xiongfeng Peng,Yiwei Chen,Weiming Li,Jaewook Yoo,Sunghyun Chunag,Dongwook Lee,Daehyun Ji,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoSE, a skill-oriented MoE model for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reasoning tasks with fewer parameters and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in autonomous driving systems by improving their generalization and interpretability using a skill-oriented Mixture-of-Experts model inspired by human learning processes.

Method: The authors proposed MoSE, which employs a skill-oriented routing mechanism and hierarchical skill dataset, and integrates auxiliary tasks without extra computational costs.

Result: MoSE, with less than 3B parameters, outperformed larger models (8B+ parameters) on the CODA AD corner case reasoning task, reducing model size by at least 62.5%.

Conclusion: MoSE demonstrates that skill-oriented design and step-by-step reasoning improve both efficiency and performance in autonomous driving system tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

### [22] [AI Should Sense Better, Not Just Scale Bigger: Adaptive Sensing as a Paradigm Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07820)
*Eunsu Baek,Keondo Park,Jeonggil Ko,Min-hwan Oh,Taesik Gong,Hyung-Sin Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper highlights the concept of adaptive sensing, inspired by biological sensory systems, to enhance AI efficiency and sustainability while reducing reliance on large models and extensive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to reduce environmental, economic, and ethical costs associated with the dominant AI paradigm reliant on scaling neural models and large datasets.

Method: The study proposes adaptive sensing, a dynamic modulation of sensor parameters at the input level, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that adaptive sensing allows small AI models to surpass the performance of bigger models that require more data and computational resources.

Conclusion: Adaptive sensing is a promising approach to achieving sustainable, robust, and equitable AI systems, and the paper provides a roadmap for its integration across various domains.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

*Samuel Reyd,Ada Diaconescu,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses criticism in XAI literature by proposing algorithms to identify actual causes with polynomial complexity, adjustable precision, and applicability to various systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between classical XAI explanations focused on contributing factors and non-expert users' need for actual causes.

Method: Developed algorithms with polynomial complexity that can handle non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems while allowing precision and exhaustiveness adjustments.

Result: The algorithms effectively identify actual causes for different system categories, outperforming existing approaches and balancing computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve causal identification for real-world systems, enhancing XAI applicability and meeting diverse user needs.

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper enhances large language models for legal dispute analysis by integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs, achieving improved performance in complex legal cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face limitations in legal contexts due to inadequate legal knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. The paper aims to address these gaps.

Method: The framework combines a hierarchical prompt structure (task definition, knowledge background, reasoning guidance) and a three-layer knowledge graph for legal knowledge. Enhanced legal concept retrieval uses four complementary methods and web search integration.

Result: Experimental results reveal improved performance in legal dispute analysis, demonstrating better legal application accuracy and understanding of judicial decision-making processes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework represents a novel, effective approach to improving intelligent legal decision support systems, addressing deficiencies in current models.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

*Hans Gundlach,Jayson Lynch,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that diminishing returns in AI scaling will lead to meek models (with limited computation budgets) approaching the performance of large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems exhibit stark inequalities in performance, driven by disparities in compute resources, but diminishing returns may alter this dynamic.

Method: A model illustrating diminishing returns under computational scaling was developed and analyzed alongside benchmark evidence and empirical capability data.

Result: The analysis suggests marginal capability differences decrease significantly with increased compute, favoring smaller-scale models.

Conclusion: This convergence in AI capabilities necessitates a reevaluation of AI strategy and policy as meek models gain increasing significance.

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the economic impact of generative AI by studying its usage in work activities across occupations. It combines activity data with task success metrics to compute AI applicability for various jobs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the societal and economic effects of generative AI and identify how AI influences work activities across different occupations.

Method: The authors analyzed 200k anonymized conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot to classify work activities, measure task success, and assess the scope of impact. This data was used to compute AI applicability scores for occupations.

Result: The study found that AI is most applicable to knowledge work occupations such as computer and mathematical jobs, and office support roles. The tasks most successfully performed by AI include providing information, writing, teaching, and advising.

Conclusion: Generative AI has significant applicability in occupations involving information-focused tasks. Real-world usage aligns with predictions, indicating growing AI influence in knowledge work and administrative roles.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM2IM, a hardware-software accelerator, to optimize transposed convolutions in generative AI models on edge devices, achieving significant speed and energy efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transposed Convolutions, crucial for up-scaling in generative AI models, encounter inefficiencies like overlapping sums and computational waste, especially on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The paper combines hardware-software co-design, leveraging Matrix Multiplication (MatMul) and col2IM for optimizing TCONV processing on limited-resource devices, implemented via the SECDA-TFLite toolkit.

Result: MM2IM achieved average speedups of 1.9x against ARM Neon-optimized CPUs (261 configurations), up to 4.2x speedup on TCONV layers from generative models, and at least 2x GOPs/DSP improvement over other accelerators.

Conclusion: MM2IM demonstrates superior performance and energy efficiency for transposed convolution layers in generative AI models on edge devices, significantly mitigating computation bottlenecks.

Abstract: Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant
Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output
mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies
further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on
resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we
propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix
Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on
resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design
toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV
problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a
dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance
of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving
up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV
accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate
MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x
energy reduction against the CPU baseline.

*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the cognitive biases in large language models (LLMs), highlighting how these biases are influenced by pretraining, finetuning, and training randomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origins and factors behind cognitive biases in LLMs is crucial for improving model design and ensuring rational decision-making.

Method: The researchers employed a two-step causal experimental approach: 1) analyzing training randomness effects with multiple random seeds and 2) introducing cross-tuning by swapping instruction datasets to test dataset-dependency of biases.

Result: Key findings show that biases are primarily shaped by pretraining, as models with the same backbone exhibit more similar patterns than those sharing finetuning data. Training randomness introduces variability but is less impactful.

Conclusion: To address cognitive biases in LLMs, focusing on pretraining origins rather than solely finetuning effects is necessary. This insight helps in creating strategies to evaluate and mitigate biases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in simulating survey responses, revealing their vulnerabilities to response biases and the importance of robust prompt design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the reliability of LLMs in mimicking human survey responses and assess their susceptibility to response biases for social science applications.

Method: The authors tested nine LLMs using the World Values Survey questions, applying 11 perturbations to question phrasing and answer structures, generating over 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: LLMs showed weaknesses, including recency bias, sensitivity to semantic and structural variations, and partial alignment with human survey biases. Larger models showed improved but imperfect robustness.

Conclusion: Robust prompt design and thorough sensitivity testing are crucial for accurately employing LLMs in synthetic survey data generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for evaluating synthetic text in terms of utility, fairness, privacy risks, and distribution-related differences, focused on high-stakes domains like healthcare and law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for systematic evaluations of synthetic text as its adoption grows in privacy-sensitive AI systems.

Method: SynthTextEval provides evaluation metrics and modules to analyze synthetic data in terms of utility, fairness, privacy risks, distribution differences, and expert qualitative feedback.

Result: The toolkit serves as a standardized framework for evaluating synthetic text, demonstrated with datasets in healthcare and law domains.

Conclusion: SynthTextEval improves the consistent evaluation of synthetic text, contributing to privacy-preserving AI development in high-risk domains.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tailored safety evaluation protocol for medical large language models (LLMs) to assess safety from patient, clinician, and general user perspectives, including the creation of PatientSafetyBench with 466 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of LLMs in the medical field raises crucial safety concerns due to their potential impact on human health and the lack of domain-specific safety evaluations tailored to medical applications.

Method: The authors propose a safety evaluation protocol accounting for patient, clinician, and general user perspectives. They create PatientSafetyBench, consisting of 466 samples across 5 critical safety categories, and apply red-teaming protocols to MediPhi model collection as a case study.

Result: The study provides a quantitative analysis of the safety of medical LLMs, identifies critical safety issues, and introduces evaluation criteria using targeted red-teaming protocols based on distinct user roles.

Conclusion: This is the first framework to comprehensively define and establish safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs, offering a foundational approach toward their safer deployment in sensitive medical domains.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [32] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on detecting and interpreting interruptions in collaborative learning settings using AI, with a method robust to overlapping speech in multi-group conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting interruptions in noisy classroom environments with multiple concurrent conversations, as existing methods work well only in single-conversation settings.

Method: The study analyzes interruption detection in both single-conversation and multi-group settings and proposes a state-of-the-art method for identifying interruptions robust to overlapping speech.

Result: A robust interruption identification method was developed, capable of functioning effectively in collaborative classroom group settings with overlapping speech.

Conclusion: This research advances interruption detection methods, making them suitable for classroom environments, and provides insights into linguistic and prosodic patterns of interruptions, paving the way for better AI-driven classroom monitoring systems.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents a novel framework for generating high-quality counterspeech against health misinformation using multiple LLMs and retrieval-augmented techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating counterspeech against misinformation have limitations in evidence reliance and control over the outputs.

Method: Introduced a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework leveraging multiple LLMs for optimized knowledge retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response generation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baselines in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, validated through ablation and human preference studies.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances the quality of counterspeech and demonstrates the importance of refinement and evidence integration in misinformation countering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents a new neural architecture combining GNNs and CNNs for efficient text processing while overcoming limitations of transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of transformer-based models for processing long documents due to their quadratic computational complexity.

Method: The model combines CNNs and GNNs with real-time graph generation, uses dictionary lookups for LLM integration, and employs graph-based structures to capture local and document-level information.

Result: Graphs generated by the model exhibit meaningful semantic organization and achieve competitive performance in text classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates efficiency and competitive performance across tasks, providing a viable alternative to transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There’s a critical need for effective human-AI communication in healthcare, where content must be personalized and accessible, especially at lower literacy levels.

Method: MedReadCtrl introduces readability-controlled instruction tuning to large language models (LLMs), assessing performance across nine datasets and three tasks.

Result: MedReadCtrl outperforms GPT-4 in readability instruction-following errors and clinical tasks, showing improved metrics like ROUGE-L and SARI, with experts favoring its outputs for patients with lower literacy.

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl offers a scalable way to make clinical content more understandable while preserving medical intent, enhancing patient education and equitable access to AI-powered care.

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline leveraging LLMs and automation to efficiently extract eviction-related information from clinical notes, achieving high accuracy while significantly reducing annotation efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eviction is a critical SDoH that impacts various aspects like housing, mental health, and employment, but it is often not systematically recorded in structured EHR fields, creating gaps in downstream applications.

Method: SynthEHR-Eviction integrates LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes, producing a dataset with 14 fine-grained categories.

Result: The fine-tuned LLMs trained on SynthEHR-Eviction achieved superior Macro-F1 scores compared to existing models, while the pipeline cut annotation efforts by over 80%, making it efficient and cost-effective.

Conclusion: SynthEHR-Eviction enables scalable and accurate detection of eviction-related information, facilitates faster dataset generation, and adapts to broader information extraction tasks in healthcare domains.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores distilling time series reasoning abilities into compact language models using synthetic mean-reverting time series datasets and fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop compact and interpretable time series models capable of explaining temporal patterns in natural language for on-device or privacy-sensitive environments.

Method: Synthetic time series datasets were annotated using a large model. These annotations were used to fine-tune small Qwen language models. Novel evaluation metrics assessed reasoning capabilities.

Result: The distilled models demonstrated meaningful interpretive abilities in analyzing trends, noise, and extremum locations, confirming their potential use.

Conclusion: The research suggests lightweight, language-capable models can serve as interpretable tools for understanding time series data in privacy-sensitive settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAND framework introduces a method for LLM agents to systematically deliberate over actions, leading to improved decision-making beyond traditional finetuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM agent tuning methods, such as supervised finetuning and preference optimization, often lead to over-committing to plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited exploration of the action space.

Method: The SAND framework enables LLMs to deliberate over candidate actions by incorporating self-consistency-based action sampling and execution-guided critique. These deliberations refine the LLM model in an iterative manner.

Result: Using the SAND framework, LLM agents achieve an average 20% improvement on interactive tasks compared to initial supervised finetuning and outperform state-of-the-art tuning methods.

Conclusion: SAND enhances LLM agent decision-making by fostering reasoning over alternative actions, addressing prior limitations in action space exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose RLEP, a reinforcement learning framework that combines verified trajectory replay and newly generated rollouts to improve model performance and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models with reinforcement learning is energy-intensive and prone to instability, with the risk of the policy diverging from pretrained weights. This creates a need for efficient methods to stabilize learning and enhance outcomes.

Method: RLEP involves a two-phase approach: first collecting verified trajectories and then replaying these examples during training. The model's optimization blends newly generated rollouts with these replayed successful paths for better-focused learning.

Result: RLEP achieves faster convergence and better final accuracy. For example, it improves Qwen2.5-Math-7B model performance on benchmarks such as AIME-2024, AIME-2025, and AMC-2023, achieving notable gains in accuracy.

Conclusion: RLEP provides a robust way to improve both efficiency and performance in reinforcement learning for large language models by focusing learning efforts on high-quality reasoning paths. The publicly available code and datasets enable further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines 'machine bullshit,' defined as an emergent loss of truthfulness in large language models (LLMs), introducing a Bullshit Index and a taxonomy for qualitative forms of bullshit. They find that fine-tuning using RLHF and chain-of-thought prompting amplify bullshit in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenge of LLMs generating untruthful information, referred to as 'machine bullshit,' and to provide a systematic framework to study it comprehensively.

Method: The authors introduced the Bullshit Index as a novel metric and developed a taxonomy of four bullshit forms: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. They conducted evaluations on existing datasets and a newly created benchmark, BullshitEval, assessing 100 AI assistants across 2,400 scenarios.

Result: Empirical results revealed that fine-tuning with RLHF significantly increases instances of bullshit, while chain-of-thought prompting amplifies specific forms such as empty rhetoric and paltering. Machine bullshit was notably prevalent in political contexts, where weasel words dominated.

Conclusion: The study highlights systematic issues in AI alignment and emphasizes the need for strategies to improve truthfulness in LLM-generated outputs to reduce the emergence of machine bullshit.

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

*Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Xin Liu,Yiwen Song,Mingyang Ling,Chitta Baral,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING is a strategy aimed at enhancing smaller-language models' reasoning capabilities by using planning structures derived from larger LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies lack approaches to improve smaller language models' complex reasoning by leveraging large-scale LLMs' planning capabilities.

Method: PLAN-TUNING distills synthetic task decompositions from large LLMs and fine-tunes smaller models using supervised and reinforcement objectives based on these decompositions.

Result: PLAN-TUNING improves smaller models' performance by ~7% on GSM8k and MATH benchmarks and enhances generalization with ~10-12% gains on out-of-domain datasets like OlympiadBench and AIME 2024.

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING demonstrates the positive impact of planning trajectories in improving reasoning and generalization for smaller open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Research proposes TeaR, a technique leveraging data curation and reinforcement learning to improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Demonstrated substantial performance gains across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reasoning challenges in LLMs caused by over-reliance on algorithmic patterns rather than essential reasoning structures.

Method: TeaR employs guided learning through curated data and reinforcement learning to improve reasoning paths in code-related tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show TeaR's effectiveness, including a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and a 5.9% improvement on R1-Distilled-7B.

Conclusion: Significant enhancements in reasoning abilities were achieved, signifying TeaR's potential to tackle reasoning complexity in LLMs.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the generalization gap between implicit and explicit reward models in language models, finding that implicit reward models rely more on superficial token-level cues, which harms their generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the cause of the generalization gap between implicit reward models (IM-RMs) and explicit reward models (EX-RMs) in language modeling, despite them being similar in training and design.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis and experimental evidence to investigate the generalization behavior and biases of IM-RMs and EX-RMs. They also evaluate and rule out alternative explanations for the observed gap.

Result: The study finds that IM-RMs generalize worse because they depend heavily on token-level cues, which makes them perform poorly under token-level distribution shifts and sometimes even in-distribution.

Conclusion: Small design differences, such as how rewards are computed, can significantly affect the generalization performance of reward models. Understanding these biases is important for improving model robustness.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

*Hein Htet,Amgad Ahmed Ali Ibrahim,Yutaka Sasaki,Ryoji Asahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using DyGIE++ and BERT variants, especially MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related data from scientific literature, achieving promising results in named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient extraction of structured information about oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is essential in enhancing fuel cell efficiency, but is hindered by the complexity of textual data in scientific literature.

Method: The study uses named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) techniques, employing DyGIE++ with fine-tuned, domain-specific BERT models like MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT. A manually constructed dataset of 12 entities and 2 relationship types was used for training and testing.

Result: The fine-tuned PubMedBERT achieved the highest NER F1-score of 82.19%, while MatSciBERT achieved the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Comparison with human annotators confirmed the reliability of these models.

Conclusion: Domain-specific BERT models, such as PubMedBERT and MatSciBERT, are effective for extracting ORR catalyst information and outperform general-purpose models, offering scalable solutions for literature analysis in materials science.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

### [45] [Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07505)
*Varin Sikka,Vishal Sikka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the computational limits of large language models (LLMs), particularly in handling complex tasks autonomously and their incapability of verifying accuracy beyond certain complexity thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of transformer-based LLMs has generated interest in understanding their limitations, especially their hallucinations and their capabilities in autonomous/agentic tasks.

Method: The study investigates LLMs' computational complexity in performing and verifying tasks, presenting theoretical insights backed by examples.

Result: The findings indicate that LLMs cannot perform or verify tasks surpassing defined complexity levels, with specific illustrations provided.

Conclusion: Certain computational constraints inherently limit the tasks LLMs can autonomously perform or validate, highlighting the need for careful application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

### [46] [Toward Real-World Chinese Psychological Support Dialogues: CPsDD Dataset and a Co-Evolving Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07509)
*Yuanchen Shi,Longyin Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors address the lack of psychological counseling datasets, especially in non-English languages, by creating a Chinese Psychological Support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD) and introducing a dialogue system (CADSS) that provides empathetic responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing demand for psychological support, coupled with the scarcity of datasets in non-English languages, which hampers the development of effective systems.

Method: They use expert knowledge and limited real-world data to fine-tune two large language models. The first, a Dialog Generator, creates psychological counseling dialogues, while a Dialog Modifier refines them. They also build the CPsDD dataset and introduce CADSS, a multi-component system that analyzes, plans, and generates supportive dialogue.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on psychological support tasks using the CPsDD and ESConv datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances psychological support systems by filling the dataset gap, particularly for non-English users, and demonstrating CADSS's ability to deliver effective and empathetic dialogue.

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores voice activity projection (VAP) models to predict turn-taking in triadic conversations using acoustic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expand turn-taking analysis beyond dyadic settings and evaluate VAP in triadic dialogue.

Method: Train voice activity projection models on a Japanese triadic dialogue dataset discussing various topics.

Result: VAP models applied to triadic conversations outperformed the baseline, though accuracy varied depending on conversation type.

Conclusion: VAP is effective for predicting turn-taking in triadic setups; future integration into dialogue systems is proposed.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

*Akram Elbouanani,Evan Dufraisse,Aboubacar Tuo,Adrian Popescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) using few-shot prompting proved highly effective in multilingual subjectivity detection, achieving top rankings in the CheckThat! 2025 campaign.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore the performance and adaptability of LLMs for multilingual subjectivity detection using few-shot prompting, particularly in cases of noisy or low-quality data.

Method: The paper utilized LLMs with carefully designed few-shot prompts, experimented with advanced prompt engineering techniques, and benchmarked their system in multilingual settings against fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs).

Result: Their method achieved top rankings across multiple languages, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and demonstrated resilience against annotation inconsistencies.

Conclusion: LLMs with few-shot prompting offer a competitive and adaptable solution for multilingual sentiment tasks, particularly when data is limited or inconsistent, outperforming traditional fine-tuning approaches in various contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

*Chen Amiraz,Yaroslav Fyodorov,Elad Haramaty,Zohar Karnin,Liane Lewin-Eytan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in domain-specific Arabic-English settings, highlighting retrieval challenges and proposing a strategy for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to study and address retrieval challenges in cross-lingual RAG, particularly in domain-specific and real-world corporate contexts rather than generic open-domain benchmarks.

Method: The authors created benchmarks using corporate datasets with randomized document-query language combinations and systematically analyzed multilingual retrieval behavior. They proposed a retrieval strategy enforcing equal retrieval from both languages.

Result: The study shows retrieval bottlenecks when user query and supporting document languages differ, identifying retriever ranking challenges. Their strategy led to substantial improvements in multilingual retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual RAG, and their proposed strategy offers effective improvements, underscoring practical opportunities for enhancing multilingual retrieval.

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

### [50] [The Synergy Dilemma of Long-CoT SFT and RL: Investigating Post-Training Techniques for Reasoning VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07562)
*Jierun Chen,Tiezheng Yu,Haoli Bai,Lewei Yao,Jiannan Wu,Kaican Li,Fei Mi,Chaofan Tao,Lei Zhu,Manyi Zhang,Xiaohui Li,Lu Hou,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning abilities in large vision-language models (VLMs), revealing trade-offs and lack of additive benefits when combining these techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess the joint effectiveness of widely adopted post-training techniques (SFT and RL) in enhancing reasoning capabilities within large vision-language models.

Method: The study systematically evaluates various strategies to combine techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning across multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Result: SFT improves structured reasoning on difficult questions but increases verbosity, while RL enhances generalization and benefits simpler questions; however, combining them fails to yield synergistic improvements.

Conclusion: Contrasting benefits of SFT and RL expose a "synergy dilemma," necessitating novel adaptive approaches for optimized reasoning in vision-language systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces M4Doc, a framework aligning image encoders with Multimodal Large Language Models to improve document image machine translation, achieving better generalization and translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIMT faces challenges from limited training data and complex visual-textual interplay in document images.

Method: The method involves aligning an image-only encoder with multimodal representations in MLLMs using pre-trained large-scale document datasets, enabling efficient training and inference.

Result: Experiments show significant translation quality improvements, particularly in cross-domain generalization and demanding scenarios.

Conclusion: M4Doc enhances DIMT by leveraging multimodal knowledge and maintaining efficiency during inference, addressing existing challenges effectively.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

*Cooper Doyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uncovers the Bayesian aspects in discrete-diffusion language models and proposes an inference-time ensemble technique to enhance token probabilities and uncertainty estimates, leading to notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the link between discrete-diffusion language models and Bayesian principles to improve inference accuracy and generalization through better posterior estimates.

Method: The paper establishes a mathematical foundation proving that under certain assumptions, averaging over K corruptions via Monte Carlo methods leads to posterior recovery. They introduce a lightweight ensemble method during inference time without additional training, leveraging the mask-and-denoise approach.

Result: On WikiText-2 dataset, their approach achieves a test perplexity of 8.8 using K=8, outperforming GPT-2 Small which records a perplexity of 20.3. This demonstrates superior performance despite using a model of comparable size.

Conclusion: Their proposed method enhances inference-time token probability distributions and uncertainty quantifications in discrete-diffusion models while ensuring practical benefits without altering training procedures.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) using Knowledge Distillation (KD) to retain strong performance on Question Answering (QA) tasks while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying computationally demanding LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The authors used Knowledge Distillation (KD) to create student models from the Pythia and Qwen2.5 LLM families and tested them on two QA benchmarks (SQuAD and MLQA) under zero-shot and one-shot prompting conditions.

Result: The student models retained over 90% of their teacher models' performance, with parameter counts reduced by up to 57.1%. Additional gains were observed using one-shot prompting.

Conclusion: Knowledge Distillation, paired with minimal prompting, enables the creation of efficient and capable QA systems suitable for limited-resource deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates methods to answer complex questions using document retrieval and generation, demonstrating that simple prompt improvements can outperform state-of-the-art techniques, while showing fine-tuning enhances efficiency without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inefficiency and lack of focus on retrieval frugality in answering complex questions using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models.

Method: Analyzing the impact of prompt optimization and fine-tuning techniques, including reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised methods, on RAG metrics and retrieval efficiency.

Result: Improved prompts outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and recall, while fine-tuning reduces latency by decreasing retrieval searches during inference, achieving competitive RAG metrics with lower costs.

Conclusion: Significant improvements in retrieval-augmented generation are possible without large-scale fine-tuning, combining efficient prompts with cost-effective training methods to optimize accuracy and inference latency.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) in Chinese content moderation by creating a realistic dataset and proposing improved detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the difficulty in moderating content hidden via phonetic cloaking and the inadequacy of existing rule-based approaches to handle creative, real-user-generated perturbations.

Method: The researchers organized PCR into a taxonomy, compiled a dataset (\

Result: The study improves the detection performance for PCR and highlights the limits of current detectors, offering both benchmark data and effective mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: This paper contributes classification frameworks, realistic evaluation datasets, and promising methods for improving toxicity detection in cases of PCR, significantly advancing research in the field.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

### [56] [An Automated Length-Aware Quality Metric for Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07653)
*Andrew D. Foland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOIR, an automatic metric for assessing summarization quality based on semantic retention and summary compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated, objective measure of summarization quality that eliminates the need for human-generated reference summaries.

Method: The proposed method, NOIR, combines semantic similarity measured through language model embeddings and compression ratios to evaluate the tradeoff between recall and compression in summarization.

Result: Experiments show NOIR correlates well with human judgments and effectively captures summarization tradeoffs between token length and semantic retention.

Conclusion: NOIR can serve as a reliable tool for evaluating summarization algorithms, prompts, and synthetic summaries, facilitating improvements in summarization methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Simulated Attention Score (SAS), a technique that enhances the attention capacity of Transformer models by simulating larger model configurations without increasing parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency and performance of the Transformer architecture by addressing the trade-off between increasing the attention heads/hidden dimensions and maintaining a compact model size.

Method: SAS projects low-dimensional attention heads into higher-dimensional spaces, simulating larger attention configurations. Additionally, it extends this simulation approach to key and query embeddings, and introduces Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) for cost control.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and tasks show that SAS significantly outperforms existing attention mechanisms, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SAS and PEAA enable compact Transformer models to achieve high performance, efficiently balancing model size and attention expressiveness.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

*Hruday Markondapatnaikuni,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces K2RAG, a new framework for efficient and accurate knowledge expansion in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs through traditional fine-tuning is resource-intensive and becomes increasingly challenging as models grow in size. There is a need for a new approach to integrate knowledge effectively and efficiently.

Method: K2RAG integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization, coupled with a preprocessing step for summarizing training data to enhance retrieval and reduce training time.

Result: K2RAG achieved better accuracy with a mean answer similarity score of 0.57 and a third-quartile similarity of 0.82. It reduced training time by 93%, sped up execution by up to 40%, and required three times less VRAM compared to naive RAG implementations.

Conclusion: The K2RAG framework offers a significant improvement in scalability, efficiency, and accuracy over traditional RAG systems, making it a promising solution for knowledge expansion in LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

Motivation: Text embeddings are widely used for NLP but are often considered privacy-preserving. Vec2Text challenges this assumption by reconstructing text from embeddings, raising privacy concerns.

Method: The authors replicate Vec2Text's results and conduct further experiments, including parameter sensitivity analysis and privacy defense evaluation using Gaussian noise and embedding quantization.

Result: The study replicates Vec2Text's findings and demonstrates its efficacy in ideal scenarios, but it reveals limitations such as sensitivity to input length. Privacy defenses like quantization show promise in mitigating risks.

Conclusion: While Vec2Text can reconstruct sensitive data like passwords, its limitations and the effectiveness of privacy mitigation strategies like embedding quantization require further exploration to secure NLP systems.

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: Selective-DPO enhances preference alignment in LLMs by prioritizing high-impact tokens, reducing computational costs, and improving results compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not all tokens in large language models (LLMs) equally contribute to performance or alignment fidelity, necessitating targeted strategies.

Method: Selective alignment strategy emphasizing token-level log-probability differences, leveraging effective token prioritization and stronger reference models.

Result: Selective-DPO outperforms standard DPO and distillation methods on benchmarks like Arena-Hard and MT-Bench, enhancing optimization and alignment efficiency.

Conclusion: Selective-DPO validates the importance of token-level optimization and quality reference models in improving preference alignment for LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

*Peizhang Shao,Linrui Xu,Jinxi Wang,Wei Zhou,Xingyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews the application of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in legal domains, identifying progress and challenges while proposing a refined taxonomy for future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs address traditional limitations in legal reasoning and to unify historical and contemporary breakthroughs through a novel dual-lens taxonomy.

Method: Combining legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies to build a taxonomy that maps NLP tasks to legal roles, and computationally implementing Toulmin argumentation for systematic study.

Result: Documented advancements such as legal semantics understanding, task generalization, and addressing text processing challenges with sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts architectures.

Conclusion: The study offers a roadmap and conceptual framework for enhancing LLMs in legal applications and outlines key research areas to overcome adoption challenges including dynamic rebuttal handling and low-resource systems.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

### [63] [StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803)
*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreamUni, a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) for streaming speech translation (StreamST). It achieves speech segmentation, policy decision, and translation generation without relying heavily on segmentation models or massive policy-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) methods, which rely on truncated speech segments and struggle with complexity in speech input for effective policy decisions.

Method: StreamUni incorporates a speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework guiding LSLM to generate multi-stage outputs. It also introduces a streaming CoT training method with limited CoT data to enhance low-latency policy-making and translation generation.

Result: StreamUni achieves state-of-the-art performance in streaming speech translation tasks, offering improved latency and translation quality.

Conclusion: StreamUni streamlines the StreamST process, simplifies policy training requirements, and demonstrates effective integration of segmentation, policy, and translation tasks in a cohesive framework.

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

### [64] [Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07808)
*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers propose a Transformer-based decoder model to reverse semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae, making embeddings invertible and useful for tasks like requirement mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable continuous learning and optimization directly within the semantic space of formulae, addressing the necessity for embeddings to be invertible in practical usage.

Method: A Transformer-based decoder-only model is trained using a small vocabulary derived from STL syntax to invert signal embeddings while preserving semantic properties.

Result: The model successfully generates valid STL formulae after only 1 epoch and generalizes to the semantic aspects of the logic within approximately 10 epochs. It also creates simpler and semantically consistent formulae compared to gold references.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures semantic information, generalizes to complex training data, and facilitates optimization in semantic space for tasks such as requirement mining.

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) recognize repetitive patterns and their influence on in-context learning (ICL), focusing on skill neurons instead of attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize the impact of specific neural mechanisms, like repetition neurons, on LLM performance and output quality.

Method: The study investigated the role of repetition neurons across different model layers and compared their effects with induction heads while exploring strategies for minimizing repetitive outputs.

Result: The influence of repetition neurons on ICL significantly depends on their layer depth, and targeted strategies can mitigate repetitive outputs without compromising learning capabilities.

Conclusion: Repetition neurons play a nuanced role in ICL, and their management offers a path to improve LLM performance and output diversity.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

### [66] [On the Effect of Instruction Tuning Loss on Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07817)
*Anwoy Chatterjee,H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala,Sumit Bhatia,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT), which adjusts the loss function weights for prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning to improve language model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning loss functions are suboptimal, as they exclude prompt tokens from loss computation, potentially limiting model robustness and performance.

Method: The authors systematically test varying weights for prompt and response tokens in the loss function across multiple models, datasets, and evaluation benchmarks.

Result: Their experiments show that low-to-moderate weights for prompt tokens and moderate-to-high weights for response tokens yield better-performing, robust, and generalizable models.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of revisiting instruction tuning loss functions and provides insights for designing improved language models through WIT.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

*Gianluca Vico,Jindřinch Libovický*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel tokenization method, conditional unigram tokenization, which focuses on enhancing cross-lingual semantic alignment by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve semantic alignment in cross-lingual tokenization to better support tasks such as machine translation and language modeling.

Method: The authors use conditional unigram tokenization that conditions probabilities on source-language tokens and optimize this tokenization using parallel textual data.

Result: The conditional tokenizer shows mixed results: it doesn't improve machine translation quality but achieves reduced perplexity in language modeling consistently.

Conclusion: The approach faces scalability challenges due to quadratic scaling issues in probability estimation, suggesting the need for alternative parameterization for practical application.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

*Youngjoon Jang,Seongtae Hong,Junyoung Son,Sungjin Park,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of entity coreference resolution on RAG-based systems, focusing on improving document retrieval and Q&A performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how coreferential complexity disrupts in-context learning and impacts retrieval and generation performance in RAG systems.

Method: The study analyzes the effects of coreference resolution on retrieval relevance, context understanding, and QA performance, comparing different pooling strategies like mean pooling.

Result: Coreference resolution improves retrieval effectiveness, QA performance, and helps smaller models handle ambiguity better; mean pooling is identified as a superior strategy for context capturing.

Conclusion: Incorporating coreference resolution improves RAG system performance, offering insights to tackle coreferential challenges in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-layered semantic game framework grounded in Alpay Algebra, focusing on transfinite fixed-point iterations to achieve semantic equilibria in AI systems, with theoretical grounding in category and information theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how hierarchical game-theoretic reasoning can naturally emerge from fixed-point iteration processes in alignment tasks between AI systems and semantic documents.

Method: The paper constructs a composite operator combining global and local semantic processes, proves existence of semantic equilibria using transfinite iterations, and validates results through extensions of fixed-point theorems and category theory paradigms.

Result: Game-theoretic reasoning is shown to arise inherently from iterative fixed-point frameworks, with proven semantic equilibria and alignment validated using advanced mathematical and categorical structures.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust game-theoretic and transfinite fixed-point framework for semantic alignment in AI cognition, with practical implications for embedding semantic patterns in various cognitive systems.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocCHA, a modular framework that improves clinical diagnosis via structured and transparent dialogue, outperforming existing large language models (LLMs) on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current Conversational Health Agents (CHAs), which lack adaptability and transparency, essential for effective clinical diagnosis.

Method: DocCHA decomposes the diagnostic process into three stages: symptom elicitation, history acquisition, and causal graph construction. Interpretable confidence scores guide adaptive questioning, prioritize clarifications, and address weak reasoning links.

Result: DocCHA outperforms LLM baselines like GPT and LLaMA on Chinese consultation datasets, achieving a 5.18% higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30% improvement in symptom recall with minimal dialogue turns.

Conclusion: DocCHA effectively enhances diagnostic conversations' efficiency and trustworthiness, promising better support for clinical diagnosis in multilingual and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preparing high-quality MD simulation input files is often time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating a more streamlined and automated process.

Method: An automated pipeline integrates Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM, Python scripting, Selenium-based web automation, and CHARMM GUI to prepare NAMD input files in a largely hands-free workflow.

Result: The pipeline reduced setup time, minimized manual errors, and demonstrated scalability for handling multiple protein systems in parallel.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and adaptable solution, potentially paving the way for broader applications of LLMs in computational structural biology and simulation automation.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

*Guoxin Zang,Xue Li,Donglin Di,Lanshun Nie,Dechen Zhan,Yang Song,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents SAGE, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework designed to improve anomaly reasoning in industrial scenarios through self-guided fact enhancement and entropy-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs perform poorly in industrial anomaly detection due to lack of domain-specific adaptability, interpretability, and generalization capabilities.

Method: SAGE employs Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) for integrating domain knowledge and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO) for aligning outputs with expert preferences. Additionally, a tailored dataset (AD-PL) and evaluation metric (MLE) are introduced.

Result: SAGE achieves improved performance in zero-shot and one-shot anomaly reasoning tasks and sets benchmarks in industrial datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances anomaly reasoning, demonstrating effective adaptation to industrial contexts and offering publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

Motivation: Current AI memory systems are limited by their narrow scope and inability to reliably recall user-specific information over time. The goal is to create a memory system that can personalize, abstract, and handle diverse multimodal data effectively.

Method: The approach introduces MIRIX, which uses six memory types (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, Knowledge Vault) and a multi-agent framework to manage updates and retrieval. The system is designed for scalability and accurate long-term memory handling.

Result: MIRIX demonstrated 35% higher accuracy on the ScreenshotVQA benchmark while reducing storage by 99.9%. On the LOCOMO benchmark, it attained a state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, outperforming all existing baselines.

Conclusion: MIRIX significantly advances AI memory systems by combining innovative memory architectures and frameworks. Validation through benchmarks shows its effectiveness, and a user-friendly application has been introduced for real-world use cases.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

*Sabine Felde,Rüdiger Buchkremer,Gamal Chehab,Christian Thielscher,Jörg HW Distler,Matthias Schneider,Jutta G. Richter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smaller language models (SLMs) combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) outperform larger models in diagnostic and therapeutic tasks in rheumatology, using less energy and enabling cost-efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how AI models, especially language models, can enhance clinical decision-making in resource-limited healthcare environments like rheumatology.

Method: Comparative evaluation of smaller language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) versus larger language models (LLMs) for diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy.

Result: SLMs with RAG demonstrated higher performance than LLMs while using less energy, presenting an efficient alternative for healthcare settings.

Conclusion: SLMs combined with RAG are effective and cost-efficient for clinical applications, but their accuracy still requires expert oversight for reliable usage in areas like rheumatology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedThink-Bench, a rigorous benchmark for assessing large language models' (LLMs) medical reasoning, and proposes a novel evaluation framework, LLM-w-Ref, showing strong correlation with expert judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation strategies for LLMs in medical reasoning are either insufficient or unscalable, necessitating a reliable and rigorous benchmarking tool for transparent and trustworthy use in clinical decision-making.

Method: The authors developed MedThink-Bench with 500 expert-annotated questions spanning ten medical domains and introduced LLM-w-Ref, an evaluation method that employs rationales and LLMs as judges for scalable and accurate reasoning assessment.

Result: The LLM-w-Ref framework achieved high correlation with expert judgments, and benchmarking revealed that smaller models outperformed some larger proprietary ones. Experiments demonstrated the scalability and rigor of the benchmark.

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench serves as a critical tool to evaluate and advance the safe deployment of LLMs in clinical decision-making, highlighting that even smaller models can exhibit strong medical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: PyVision introduces a multi-turn framework enabling multimodal LLMs to independently generate, execute, and improve Python-based tools for visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in visual reasoning by predefined workflows and static toolsets in multimodal LLMs.

Method: PyVision allows autonomous generation and refinement of task-specific Python-based tools, coupled with taxonomy analyses of tools and benchmarks.

Result: PyVision enhances GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* benchmarks and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic tooling empowers models to invent tools, progressing toward agentic visual reasoning beyond mere usage.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

### [78] [Frontier LLMs Still Struggle with Simple Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07313)
*Alan Malek,Jiawei Ge,Nevena Lazic,Chi Jin,András György,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates state-of-the-art language models on simple reasoning tasks and finds that they consistently fail on such tasks despite their advanced capabilities on complex benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art language models demonstrate significant reasoning strength on complex tasks but struggle with simple problems, raising concerns about their generalization capabilities.

Method: The authors create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks and introduce the 'unpuzzles' dataset with trivialized versions of well-known puzzles to benchmark performance.

Result: State-of-the-art language models fail systematically on simple reasoning and trivial benchmarks due to issues like statistical shortcuts, intermediate errors, and context processing difficulties.

Conclusion: Despite excelling in complex benchmarks, current LLMs struggle with generalization and consistent reasoning on simpler tasks, highlighting the need for improved models that address these limitations.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

### [79] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the MMoE model to address challenges in Multimodal Entity Linking, achieving performance superior to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MEL methods face challenges with mention ambiguity and the dynamic importance of modal content, which limits their precision and adaptability.

Method: The proposed Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model incorporates large language model-driven mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, and dynamic feature selection through intra- and inter-level mixture of experts.

Result: Experiments prove that MMoE achieves superior performance compared to existing MEL methods.

Conclusion: MMoE effectively addresses the identified challenges in MEL, showcasing better capability in ambiguity resolution and adaptive content selection. Its implementation is open-source.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [80] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss (CoPT) to improve unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation by leveraging domain-agnostic text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, making unsupervised domain adaptation essential. The authors aim to exploit domain-agnostic properties of text, which have been underutilized in UDA methods for segmentation.

Method: The proposed method, CoPT, uses text embeddings generated from a large language model (LLM) to create domain descriptions. These embeddings are processed via a CLIP model to enforce domain-invariant features in the image segmentation encoder.

Result: In experiments conducted on four benchmarks, CoPT outperformed existing methods and achieved state-of-the-art results for UDA in segmentation.

Conclusion: The CoPT method effectively incorporates text-based domain-agnostic properties into semantic segmentation tasks, advancing performance in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Recall, an adversarial framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image generation unlearning methods by optimizing adversarial image prompts using multi-modal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address ethical, legal, and societal concerns with AI-generated content by improving the robustness of machine unlearning techniques for pretrained models.

Method: Recall utilizes multi-modal adversarial prompts combining image guidance and optimization alongside diffusion model capabilities, tested across ten unlearning methods.

Result: Findings demonstrate that Recall improves adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The results highlight weaknesses in current unlearning techniques and emphasize the importance of developing more robust methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel two-stream spiking neural network (SNN) for high-rate early action recognition using event-based vision sensors, achieving superior accuracy on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety and responsiveness in human-robot and human-machine interactions through precise early recognition of human actions using event-based vision systems.

Method: A two-stream high-rate spiking neural network (SNN) is introduced and benchmarked within an early event-based recognition framework, evaluating Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores across growing observation times.

Result: The SNN outperformed existing methods by 2% in final accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset and successfully demonstrated its utility in early action triggering for human motion capture sports tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of high-rate SNNs for precise and early action recognition, proving their advantages in real-world applications requiring low latency and high temporal resolution.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of modality-aware perspectives, insufficient focus on multimodal and vision-language advancements, and limited practical guidance in existing XAI surveys within biomedical image analysis.

Method: Systematic categorization and analysis of XAI methods, introduction of modality-specific taxonomy, exploration of multimodal and vision-language models, and review of evaluation metrics and frameworks.

Result: The paper provides a categorized framework, taxonomy, evaluation metrics, and discussions on emerging trends, challenges, and future directions for interpretable DL in biomedical imaging.

Conclusion: The survey serves as an in-depth resource to enhance the transparency, trust, and clinical adoption of DL models in biomedical image analysis through XAI advancements.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BASIC, a detailed evaluation framework for brain visual decoding focusing on fine-grained metrics in structural, semantic, and contextual aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating brain visual decoding lack detail, scientific foundation, and ability to capture fine-grained differences.

Method: The authors propose a multigranular framework (BASIC) that evaluates decoding fidelity at structural, semantic, and contextual levels using hierarchical segmentation metrics and multimodal large language models.

Result: The BASIC framework benchmarks visual decoding methods with fine-grained metrics across multiple neuroimaging datasets, showcasing its discriminative and interpretable capabilities.

Conclusion: BASIC provides a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework that advances the measurement of brain visual decoding methods by integrating neuroscientific and detailed comparisons.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), focusing on conflicts within inputs from different modalities. A dataset (MMMC) is introduced to study these conflicts, and three methods for mitigation are explored with reinforcement learning performing the best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of hallucinations in MLLMs, which arise from modality conflicts in real-world scenarios, to improve the models' robustness and reliability.

Method: The authors define modality conflict and introduce the MMMC dataset to simulate this issue. They propose three mitigation approaches: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. Experiments are conducted to evaluate these methods.

Result: The study found that reinforcement learning outperforms other methods in reducing hallucinations caused by modality conflicts, while supervised fine-tuning exhibits stable and promising performance.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the overlooked issue of modality conflict as a source of hallucinations and offers solutions to enhance the robustness of MLLMs through targeted approaches.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for identifying target vessels without GNSS by utilizing UAVs equipped with YOLOv8 object detection, feature matching techniques, and geometric principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for maritime surveillance and vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments for critical applications like search and rescue and threat detection.

Method: The method leverages YOLOv8 for vessel detection using onboard vision, followed by feature matching and hue histogram distance for vessel identification, with localization based on geometric principles.

Result: The approach was successfully demonstrated during the MBZIRC2023 competition in real-world conditions, showing capability in GNSS-denied navigation and vessel detection.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables autonomous maritime surveillance under computational constraints, showing promise for GNSS-denied environments through effective detection, localization, and real-world implementation.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp introduces a self-supervised, contrastive learning-based framework for polyp segmentation, achieving superior performance across benchmarks without relying on additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the accuracy of polyp segmentation for improved early diagnosis of colorectal cancer while overcoming limitations in existing methods, such as the dependency on extra labeled data and task similarity.

Method: The paper proposed CL-Polyp, a model incorporating contrastive learning for better feature discrimination. Two novel modules, MASPP for multi-scale feature fusion and CA for refined boundary reconstruction, are integrated.

Result: CL-Polyp exceeded performance benchmarks in five datasets, notably improving IoU metrics by 0.011 and 0.020 on Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp proves to be an effective, generalizable solution for clinical polyp segmentation, advancing the field by achieving enhanced accuracy without requiring additional annotations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model that translates EEG signals into multilevel semantic captions, which are then used to generate images, achieving state-of-the-art results on the EEGCVPR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate visual decoding from EEG signals despite their spatial limitations and enhance neuroscience understanding and AI interpretability.

Method: A transformer-based EEG encoder maps EEG signals onto semantic captions via contrastive learning, which condition a latent diffusion model for image generation.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art visual decoding results and aligns EEG-caption associations with neurocognitive pathways, revealing semantic topographies.

Conclusion: Structured semantic mediation enhances visual decoding from EEG, aligning outputs with cognitive representations and advancing interpretable neuro-inspired AI.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates the limitations of current video generative models for producing long-form videos, analyzing 32 papers and providing a taxonomy of methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models struggle with creating consistent, high-quality long-form videos (over 16 seconds) with multi-character scenes.

Method: Studied 32 papers on video generation, identified effective architectural components and training strategies, and developed a taxonomy with comparative tables.

Result: Highlighted existing models' issues such as redundancy, low diversity, and inconsistency in character and motion coherence.

Conclusion: Provides a guide for future video-generation model development by categorizing approaches and design strategies to improve long-form video quality.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CSCI, a lightweight method using color as a proxy to handle clothing changes in Re-Identification models without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CC-ReID faces significant challenges related to clothing changes and high resource requirements for existing methods, prompting the need for a lightweight and annotation-free solution.

Method: The proposed CSCI method cleverly uses RGB-only input to leverage color information for mitigating appearance bias. It includes a novel S2A self-attention mechanism to separate color and identity features.

Result: CSCI demonstrates improved Re-Identification performance on four CC-ReID datasets, achieving Top-1 improvements of 2.9%-5.0% for image-based and 1.0%-2.5% for video-based ReID.

Conclusion: The study establishes that color information can effectively mitigate appearance bias in CC-ReID, offering a resource-efficient alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

### [92] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisenQ, a multimodal language-guided framework to improve person identification across various activities by disentangling identity cues from motion and appearance variations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional identification struggles when identity cues are mixed with dynamic motion or appearance variations. Additional visual aids like poses and silhouettes are prone to inaccuracies.

Method: The authors propose DisenQ, a querying transformer model that uses structured textual guidance to disentangle biometrics, motion, and other features to ensure identity cues are independent of external variations.

Result: DisenQ achieves state-of-the-art performance across three activity-based benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in more traditional video-based identification tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances activity-biometrics by reducing misidentifications, showcasing its efficacy in both activity-specific and traditional identification tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: LinguaMark introduces a benchmark to evaluate Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multilingual Visual Question Answering (VQA), highlighting biases and performances across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in linguistic coverage of LMMs, which can lead to biases and unfair outputs, by emphasizing multilingual capabilities.

Method: LinguaMark provides a dataset of 6,875 image-text pairs across 11 languages and five social attributes. Models are assessed through metrics like Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness.

Result: Closed-source models generally perform best overall, but open-source models like Qwen2.5 show competitive performance and commendable multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: The release of LinguaMark and associated evaluation code aims to encourage further reproducible research in improving multilingual capabilities of LMMs.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagiC benchmark evaluates the grounded multimodal cognition of vision-language models, assessing answer accuracy, reasoning quality, visual grounding, and error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation tools for understanding whether large vision-language models genuinely perform grounded visual reasoning beyond dataset biases and patterns.

Method: Created a benchmark with 5,500 QA examples from strong model outputs, 900 human-curated examples with annotations, and evaluated models on four dimensions using new metrics like MagiScore and StepSense.

Result: Evaluated 15 models (7B–70B parameters) and diagnosed model robustness under adversarial visual cues, offering insights into their strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Highlighted key limitations and opportunities in vision-language models, emphasizing areas for improvement in grounded visual reasoning and robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents ADIEE, an approach to automatically create datasets for training better scoring models in instruction-guided image editing evaluations, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated evaluations of instruction-guided image editing are limited due to misaligned open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), opaque proprietary models, and a lack of public training datasets.

Method: The authors developed ADIEE to create a 100K+ sample dataset and used it to fine-tune a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model capable of scoring images via numeric values.

Result: The proposed scorer surpasses all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, showing marked improvements in score correlation with human ratings and pair-wise comparison accuracy.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned scorer offers state-of-the-art performance in instruction-based image editing evaluations and doubles as a reward model for automated selection and model fine-tuning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Method: A novel approximation of the Kubelka-Munk theory is proposed for faster image synthesis while preserving color blending realism. Additionally, an end-to-end framework relying on e-commerce product information is developed.

Result: The framework is validated using real-world makeup images and shown to outperform existing techniques in terms of realism and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method makes significant progress in improving the realism and scalability of foundation VTO applications, leveraging advanced image synthesis techniques and product information data.

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive reinforcement learning approach to improve visual storytelling systems' ability to connect entities across frames, showing significant gains in grounding and storytelling consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual storytelling systems, including advanced vision-language models, struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames, leading to inconsistencies and errors in storytelling.

Method: The authors use a contrastive reinforcement learning model combined with Direct Preference Optimization and a dual-component reward function to promote accurate grounding and entity re-identification. They also enhance the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples.

Result: The proposed method achieves a noticeable improvement in grounding mAP (+14.8%), F1 score (+17.1%), and cross-frame persistence for entities (+13.7%). Well-structured storytelling also rose significantly by +23.3%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances visual storytelling by addressing entity grounding and consistency issues across frames, offering a viable solution for improving coherence in vision-language models.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC introduces a label-efficient depth completion technique using synthesis of pseudo geometries to improve data diversity with minimal annotation, achieving strong generalizability across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth completion is essential for accurate perception in unseen environments, but acquiring metric depth labels for training models is labor-intensive.

Method: PacGDC synthesizes diverse pseudo geometries by manipulating scene scales and employs foundation depth models along with interpolation and relocation strategies to enhance data coverage.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate PacGDC's robust generalizability under zero-shot and few-shot settings across various benchmarks, handling diverse semantics, scales, and sparsity patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed technique provides a scalable, label-efficient approach to depth completion while achieving high generalization performance for unseen environments.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces mechanisms to improve particle-based shape modeling (PSM) by enhancing adaptivity to local geometric features while maintaining consistency in particle placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PSM methods lack self-adaptive capabilities, which are essential for capturing complex anatomical variability accurately.

Method: The proposed mechanisms include (1) a neighborhood correspondence loss for enhanced adaptivity, and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm for consistency in geodesic neighborhoods.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved adaptivity and correspondence consistency when tested against existing methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: This methodology provides a better trade-off between adaptivity and correspondence in anatomical surface modeling while achieving higher accuracy in surface representation and correspondence metrics.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSAGSM, a novel module for improving Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos and the TTA dataset for table tennis. MSAGSM outperforms prior methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PES models lack sufficient temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability for recognizing fine-grained actions in sports videos.

Method: The authors developed MSAGSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention, enabling better modeling of both short- and long-term dependencies.

Result: MSAGSM improves performance across five PES benchmarks with minimal computational overhead, and sets new state-of-the-art results. Additionally, the TTA dataset provides a new benchmark for table tennis PES.

Conclusion: The MSAGSM module enhances PES by integrating multi-scale attention and dilations, and the TTA dataset pushes forward the field with precise event annotations, establishing benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

*Zhimin Zhang,Bi'an Du,Caoyuan Ma,Zheng Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a framework to transfer animal motion behaviors across species, preserving category-specific habits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion transfer between animals across different species is critical for animation and virtual reality, but current methods fail to preserve natural habits of different species.

Method: The framework uses a generative model with a habit-preservation module featuring a category-specific habit encoder and incorporates a large language model to generalize to unobserved species.

Result: The model’s effectiveness was validated through extensive experiments using the newly introduced DeformingThings4D-skl dataset for quadruped motion, demonstrating its superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges gaps in current motion transfer methods by preserving habitual animal behaviors and enabling cross-category motion synthesis.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Seg-Wild, a novel 3D segmentation method for unconstrained photo collections using 3D Gaussian Splatting and interactive segmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting and reconstructing scenes from unconstrained photo collections, which suffer from lighting inconsistencies and transient occlusions, is challenging and existing methods fall short.

Method: Seg-Wild leverages multi-dimensional feature embeddings and a Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to interactively segment 3D scenes and handle transient occlusions effectively.

Result: Experimental results show Seg-Wild improves segmentation and reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Seg-Wild is a promising method for addressing segmentation challenges in in-the-wild scenes, paving the way for its widespread application in these scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a diffusion model capable of zero-shot novel view synthesis with amodal completion, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling fast 3D reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and improve novel view synthesis and amodal completion by addressing limitations in existing multi-stage and complex pipeline approaches.

Method: The authors propose masked fine-tuning, including input-level and feature-level masking, to create an end-to-end model. It integrates seamlessly with image-to-mesh models, enhancing performance without additional training.

Result: The model improves PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 in occluded reconstruction tasks, generalizes well to real-world scenarios, and significantly reduces 3D reconstruction time.

Conclusion: EscherNet++ is highly scalable, efficient, and achieves superior results with less data and computation compared to previous methods.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

### [105] [EPIC: Efficient Prompt Interaction for Text-Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07415)
*Xinyao Yu,Hao Sun,Zeyu Ling,Ziwei Niu,Zhenjia Bai,Rui Qin,Yen-Wei Chen,Lanfen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EPIC, a method using efficient prompt-based multimodal interactions for text-image classification, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of large multimodal models causes high computational costs for fine-tuning, creating a need for efficient strategies to align vision and language modalities.

Method: The proposed EPIC strategy uses temporal prompts in intermediate layers and similarity-based prompt interaction for efficient information exchange between modalities.

Result: EPIC achieves reduced computational resource usage and requires fewer trainable parameters (~1% of the foundation model). It performs well on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, and comparably on MM-IMDB.

Conclusion: EPIC demonstrates that efficient prompt-based strategies are effective, showcasing a balance between reduced resources and strong multimodal task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Result: Corvid surpasses leading MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks requiring mathematical reasoning and scientific problem-solving.

Conclusion: Corvid successfully enhances complex reasoning skills in MLLMs, proving a robust solution for decision-making and problem-solving applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

*Ling Zhou,Runtian Yuan,Yi Liu,Yuejie Zhang,Rui Feng,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSANet, a novel segmentation model designed to enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video by leveraging local-global feature semantic awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of significant noise in ultrasound videos, which hinders automated segmentation of organs or lesions.

Method: The authors developed DSANet, integrating two modules: the Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module for channel-wise similarity-based feature fusion and the Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module for combining local spatial details with global temporal context.

Result: DSANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy across four benchmark datasets and performs at higher inference speeds.

Conclusion: The proposed DSANet effectively improves noise robustness and efficiency in ultrasound video segmentation while surpassing current video- and image-based methods.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D vision-language research lacks robust spatial reasoning capabilities as models often rely on semantic shortcuts rather than interpreting spatial relationships.

Method: The authors created S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset with over 89,000 spatial queries free from object name bias, covering diverse spatial reasoning aspects and paired with 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmarks.

Result: Initial tests showed that state-of-the-art models struggled significantly with the spatial reasoning challenges posed by S\textsc{urprise}3D.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D helps push forward spatially aware AI development, improving embodied interaction and robotics planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially

Motivation: Address the limited research in detecting blue-white veil (BWV), a critical diagnostic feature for melanoma in dermatological images.

Method: Develop a DCNN trained on annotated datasets, using a color threshold technique for dataset annotation and custom layers for classification of BWV presence. XAI algorithms are applied for interpretability.

Result: Testing accuracy achieved: 85.71% on PH2 dataset, 95.00% on ISIC dataset, 95.05% on combined dataset, and 90.00% on Derm7pt dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed DCNN and XAI improve BWV detection in skin lesions, outperforming existing models and offering a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Objectomaly, an objectness-aware refinement framework that addresses key challenges in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation by leveraging object-level priors for score calibration and boundary precision. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy of OoD segmentation for safety-critical tasks like autonomous driving by solving limitations in existing methods, such as imprecise boundaries, inconsistent anomaly scores, and false positives.

Method: The Objectomaly framework operates in three stages: Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using existing OoD backbones, Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) using instance masks for score normalization, and Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) using Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for improved boundary delineation.

Result: Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art results, including high AuPRC (up to 96.99), low FPR$_{95}$ (down to 0.07), and high component-level F1-scores (up to 83.44) across multiple OoD segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Objectomaly demonstrates significant improvements in OoD segmentation by refining boundary precision and integrating object-level priors, showing effectiveness across benchmarks and real-world scenarios. Its code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive

*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel GAN-based face image restoration framework to enhance recognition accuracy under adverse weather conditions, outperforming current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition in outdoor CCTV systems suffers reduced accuracy due to weather-induced image quality degradation. Addressing this gap is critical.

Method: The method integrates two components: SFFT for aligning local facial features and DAFE for robust feature extraction under poor weather conditions.

Result: Experimental validation shows the framework improves facial texture and structure suppression, outperforming state-of-the-art models under adverse weather.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances structural fidelity and perceptual quality, making it effective for face restoration in challenging weather scenarios.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative framework to address video data-privacy concerns by producing "Temporal Unlearnable Examples" (TUEs) that prevent unauthorized exploitation of personal videos for deep tracker training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of user-uploaded videos for visual object tracking raises concerns about privacy violations, as many private videos are used without authorization for training commercial models.

Method: The paper proposes the Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) framework, incorporating temporal contrastive loss, to ensure privacy protection. TUEs introduce unlearnable noise into video data, making them ineffective for training trackers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in video data privacy protection, with scalable generation of TUEs and notable transferability across models, datasets, and tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) effectively prevent unauthorized video data exploitation by altering data structure, offering a scalable and transferable solution for privacy protection in visual object tracking.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles face challenges in efficiently using online HD maps due to a lack of connection between global SD maps and local HD maps. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark called Online Map Association (OMA) and a Map Association Transformer (MAT) framework that utilizes path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms to link SD and HD maps.

Result: OMA provides a large-scale dataset (480k roads and 260k lane paths) and metrics for evaluation. The MAT framework serves as a baseline for improving map association and navigation.

Conclusion: By introducing OMA and MAT, the paper improves the association between SD and HD maps, enhancing the planning and navigation capabilities of autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Motivation: To improve image generation by diffusion models in alignment with human preferences and address issues in typical mean-seeking optimization methods.

Method: Proposes Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), based on minimizing reverse KL divergence, and provides rigorous analysis and experiments.

Result: DMPO achieves superior or matching performance compared to existing techniques, significantly outperforming diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore.

Conclusion: DMPO demonstrates the value of bridging principled theories and practical effectiveness, providing strong alignment capabilities for diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GGMotion, a novel graph dynamics-kinematics network for human motion modeling that improves physical plausibility and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling human motion fail to consider physical dependencies between joints, reducing motion realism and increasing model complexity.

Method: GGMotion leverages group graph topology, a novel radial field for spatio-temporal dependencies, interaction modules, and equivariant MLP for dynamics-kinematics propagation. It also uses an auxiliary loss during training.

Result: Experiments on the Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW benchmarks demonstrate superior performance in short-term motion prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Modeling human topology in groups with enhanced dynamics-kinematics priors delivers more realistic motion predictions, and GGMotion significantly outperforms current systems in benchmarks.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,

### [118] [MUVOD: A Novel Multi-view Video Object Segmentation Dataset and A Benchmark for 3D Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07519)
*Bangning Wei,Joshua Maraval,Meriem Outtas,Kidiyo Kpalma,Nicolas Ramin,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for object segmentation in 4D dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of extensive and well-labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in 4D object segmentation for dynamic scenes, which lacks sufficient datasets for accurate evaluation and training.

Method: The authors created a dataset consisting of 7830 RGB images (30 per video) with segmentation masks across temporal frames and views. It spans 17 scenes collected from diverse camera setups.

Result: MUVOD contains 459 instances across 73 categories, enabling tracking of objects in 4D motion. It serves as a benchmark and includes evaluation metrics, a baseline segmentation approach, and a subset for analyzing state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The MUVOD dataset aims to advance multi-view video segmentation and provides a resource for benchmarking segmentation methods across both 4D dynamic scenes and 3D static scenarios.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

### [119] [Spline Deformation Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07521)
*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a spline-based trajectory representation to overcome challenges in neural-based implicit deformation fields, ensuring spatial coherence and improving dynamic scene reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in implicit deformation fields of dense points, such as spatial incoherence, reliance on heuristic-based techniques, and underutilization of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals.

Method: The authors propose a spline-based trajectory representation tied to the explicit number of knots to manage degrees of freedom and introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding for modeling spatial and temporal dynamics.

Result: The method demonstrates improved temporal interpolation with sparse inputs and achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction, enhancing motion coherence without relying on traditional techniques like linear blend skinning.

Conclusion: The spline-based representation provides an efficient, interpretable, and coherent way to model trajectories, outperforming existing implicit and explicit methods in certain areas.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

### [120] [MAPEX: Modality-Aware Pruning of Experts for Remote Sensing Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07527)
*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX proposes a novel multi-modal foundation model for remote sensing, using modality-conditioned routing to target specific modalities, demonstrating strong performance compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing foundation models typically focus on specific modalities like optical RGB or multispectral data, leading to inefficiencies and mismatches when applying them to diverse real-world tasks.

Method: MAPEX introduces modality-conditioned token routing during pre-training on multi-modal remote sensing data and utilizes a modality-aware pruning technique for task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: MAPEX achieved strong experimental validation on diverse datasets, outperforming fully supervised training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

Conclusion: MAPEX offers an efficient and adaptable solution for creating task-specific models in remote sensing, reducing computational costs while achieving high performance.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

### [121] [Beyond the Linear Separability Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07574)
*Enrico Vompa,Tanel Tammet,Mohit Vaishnav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) in abstract reasoning, introducing the concept of Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC) to measure the performance of simple classifiers on VLM visual embeddings. It identifies reasoning bottlenecks in VLMs from poor alignment, not deficient representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address why state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with abstract reasoning tasks. It probes whether their limitations emerge from issues in visual representation or reasoning capabilities.

Method: The method introduces the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC) to evaluate the limitations of VLM embeddings. It employs postfix tuning to explore reasoning pathways and examines task-specific interventions for alignment.

Result: The analysis reveals that VLM reasoning bottlenecks do not stem from poor perception but rather from misaligned reasoning pathways. The study shows dormant reasoning abilities can be activated through tuning, depending on task complexity.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes that abstract reasoning in VLMs is more of an alignment issue than a representation quality issue, highlighting the importance of targeted alignment to unlock robust reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

### [122] [Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Weakly-Supervised Low-Light Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07578)
*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses weakly-supervised semantic segmentation under low-light conditions by proposing a novel framework combining DGKD and DGF2, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation struggle in low-light settings due to image quality issues and limitations in supervision, leading to poor model learning and results.

Method: The proposed framework synergistically uses diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation (DGKD) for feature alignment, and DGF2 to integrate depth maps for improving structural feature learning.

Result: Experiments show that the DGKD-WLSS framework outperforms other methods in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light scenarios.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS is effective in tackling the challenges of semantic ambiguity and poor image quality in low-light environments, and the framework offers a robust solution for these tasks.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical adapter for feature fusion, shared subspace projection for cross-domain transfer, MTL decoder for multi-domain processing, and an anomaly inference method using Sinkhorn-K-means clustering.

Result: NexViTAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec AD dataset, with an AUC of 97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2%.

Conclusion: NexViTAD presents a significant advancement in cross-domain anomaly detection with innovative methodologies and achieves superior performance over existing models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection
framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features
from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

### [124] [HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation for Large-Area 3D Flood Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07585)
*Wenfeng Jia,Bin Liang,Yuxi Lu,Attavit Wilaiwongsakul,Muhammad Arif Khan,Lihong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel flood mapping pipeline called HOTA that enhances the spatial detail and accuracy of flood extent and depth estimation, using Sentinel-2 imagery and digital elevation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods cause extensive damage, and timely, detailed information about flood extent and depth is crucial for effective disaster response. Existing methods often lack sufficient spatial detail or do not estimate depth.

Method: The study proposes HOTA, a plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy using hierarchical overlapping tiles for Sentinel-2 images during inference, combined with SegFormer for feature modeling and a depth estimation module based on DEM differencing.

Result: HOTA coupled with SegFormer improved the IoU metric from 73% to 84% compared to the baseline U-Net model. The 3D flood surface achieved high spatial precision with a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 meters.

Conclusion: HOTA is effective in generating accurate, large-scale 3D flood maps, serving as a valuable tool for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

*Kuiyuan Sun,Yuxuan Zhang,Jichao Zhang,Jiaming Liu,Wei Wang,Niculae Sebe,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for multi-view hair transfer, achieving high-fidelity and view-consistent results using a robust training pipeline and multi-stage optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion methods excel at diverse hairstyle generation but lack in producing consistent, high-quality multi-view outputs, crucial for applications like digital humans and avatars.

Method: The paper introduces Stable-Hair v2, employing a multi-view training pipeline with a novel Bald Converter, inpainting model, and multi-view diffusion model. It integrates pose-conditioning embeddings, temporal attention layers, and a multi-stage training strategy for optimized performance.

Result: Stable-Hair v2 successfully transfers realistic hairstyles with smooth transitions across multiple views, significantly outperforming previous approaches in multi-view hair transfer.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new benchmark for multi-view hair transfer, demonstrating the efficacy of diffusion-based techniques, and releasing the code for public use.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term
occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent
improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,
and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (LOSC) leveraging Vision-Language Models for open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for transferring image semantics to lidar data yield noisy and sparse labels, limiting segmentation robustness and effectiveness.

Method: The authors refine image-based point cloud labels by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image augmentations before training a 3D network on these improved labels.

Result: LOSC demonstrates superior zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation performance on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets.

Conclusion: An effective approach leveraging VLMs and label refinement can set new benchmarks for lidar scan segmentation in driving environments.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpatialViz-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial visualization in multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of MLLMs focus on mathematical and logical reasoning, but spatial visualization, crucial for imagination-based reasoning, lacks dedicated assessment. Existing tests may overlap with training data, jeopardizing reliability.

Method: SpatialViz-Bench was created with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, consisting of 1,180 automatically generated problems. Researchers evaluated 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs using the benchmark.

Result: Findings revealed diverse model performances, unexpected behaviors in difficulty perception, substantial 2D-to-3D performance drops, and reliance on formula-derived solutions for visualization tasks.

Conclusion: MLLMs still struggle with spatial visualization tasks, highlighting the limitations of current models and validating the efficacy of SpatialViz-Bench as an assessment tool.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper presents ViLU, a novel framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that efficiently quantifies uncertainty and predicts failures using text-contextualized uncertainty-aware embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ) and failure prediction in Vision-Language Models, a critical area lacking reliable solutions.

Method: The method involves constructing a multimodal uncertainty-aware representation by integrating visual embeddings with specific textual embeddings using cross-attention. Uniquely, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier with a weighted binary cross-entropy loss in a loss-agnostic manner.

Result: ViLU outperforms state-of-the-art failure prediction methods in experiments on various classification and large-scale image-caption datasets. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the architecture and training design.

Conclusion: ViLU provides a reliable framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification in VLMs, is versatile across datasets, and contributes significantly to this challenging area in AI research.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (T-GVC), designed to improve video reconstruction under Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by integrating sparse motion sampling and diffusion-based latent space guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of existing generative video coding methods, such as domain specificity and reliance on text guidance that often fails to capture motion details.

Method: The T-GVC framework employs semantic-aware sparse motion sampling to extract pixel-wise motion trajectories based on semantic importance. It also integrates trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes for training-free latent space guidance.

Result: Experimental results indicate that T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and state-of-the-art video compression methods under ULB conditions, with superior motion control compared to text-guided approaches.

Conclusion: T-GVC offers a promising approach for generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling, reducing bitrate while maintaining semantically accurate and physically plausible reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

TL;DR: The paper studies age-related bias in facial expression recognition systems and proposes strategies to improve fairness and accuracy, especially for elderly individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER systems demonstrate impressive performance but suffer from demographic biases, particularly age-related issues affecting their fairness and reliability.

Method: The study integrates Explainable AI techniques and compares performance across age groups, proposes three bias mitigation strategies (Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss), and validates outcomes using balanced datasets.

Result: Evaluation on the AffectNet dataset shows improved recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for expressions like 'neutral', 'sadness', and 'anger'. Saliency heatmap analysis confirms better attention allocation.

Conclusion: Age-related bias can be effectively reduced through training adjustments like age-aware strategies, using even approximate age labels to enhance fairness in FER systems.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

*Fengqian Pang,Chunyue Lei,Hongfei Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Zhiqiang Xing,Huafeng Wang,Chuyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MolCLIP, a visual language model combining time-lapse cell videos and molecular data to improve drug identification and mechanism recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing methods by leveraging both temporal dynamics of live cells and molecular data for better drug MoA understanding.

Method: A molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework is used to align video features with molecular latent spaces, coupled with a metric learning strategy.

Result: Experimental results on MitoDataset show significant improvements—51.2% in drug identification and 20.5% in MoA recognition.

Conclusion: MolCLIP effectively enhances drug discovery tasks by integrating video and molecule modalities, showcasing its potential in improving MoA understanding.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces ARNet, an AI-based tool for keypoint annotations on cervical vertebrae from cephalometric radiographs to enhance orthodontic treatment planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of growth potential via cervical vertebra analysis is crucial in pediatric orthodontics for effective intervention timing.

Method: The research employs ARNet, a deep learning tool with user-interactive features for annotating vertebral keypoints, using recalibration and morphology-aware loss for precision.

Result: ARNet significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of cervical vertebra keypoint annotation while minimizing manual effort.

Conclusion: This AI-driven method advances diagnostic tools in pediatric orthodontics, offering reliable and efficient growth potential assessments.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

*Feng Liu,Lingna Gu,Chen Shi,Xiaolan Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-DFER, a dynamic facial expression recognition architecture that integrates Action Units (AU) knowledge into deep learning models to improve accuracy without adding computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of dynamic facial expression recognition by incorporating Action Unit-driven prior knowledge into deep learning models.

Method: The authors designed an AU weight matrix to quantify AU contribution to expressions, integrated this knowledge with deep learning using AU loss, and tested it across popular DFER models and datasets.

Result: The proposed AU-DFER architecture outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods and improved recognition results, addressing label imbalance issues effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating quantified AU knowledge into DFER models and redesigning loss functions for data imbalance can significantly improve dynamic facial expression classification. The paper's code is open-source for replication.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

### [135] [Rationale-Enhanced Decoding for Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07685)
*Shin'ya Yamaguchi,Kosuke Nishida,Daiki Chijiwa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Rationale-Enhanced Decoding (RED), which significantly improves reasoning in large vision-language models (LVLMs) compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs often neglect rationales in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, compromising reasoning and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a KL-constrained reward framework with RED, an inference-time decoding strategy combining rationale and image-conditional token distributions.

Result: RED outperforms standard CoT and other decoding methods in accuracy and faithfulness across various models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: RED provides a practical strategy to enhance rationale-grounded reasoning in LVLMs for improved reliability and precision.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

### [136] [Tree-Mamba: A Tree-Aware Mamba for Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07687)
*Peixian Zhuang,Yijian Wang,Zhenqi Fu,Hongliang Zhang,Sam Kwong,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work introduces Tree-Mamba, a novel method for underwater monocular depth estimation, and presents a new dataset, BlueDepth, to improve accuracy and reliability in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of underwater monocular depth estimation is complicated by image degradation due to light absorption and scattering, and existing methods (like generic Mamba-based approaches) and datasets do not effectively handle structural features or provide reliable depth labels.

Method: Tree-Mamba employs a tree-aware scanning strategy that builds a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity and consolidates spatial topological features using bottom-up and top-down traversals. Additionally, the authors constructed the BlueDepth dataset with over 38,000 underwater image pairs with reliable depth labels.

Result: Tree-Mamba outperformed several leading methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba provides a more effective approach to underwater depth estimation by improving multi-scale feature representation and offering a high-quality dataset (BlueDepth) that enables accurate training for depth estimation tasks.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.
Code and dataset will be available at https://wyjgr.github.io/Tree-Mamba.html.

### [137] [Motion-Aware Adaptive Pixel Pruning for Efficient Local Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07708)
*Wei Shang,Dongwei Ren,Wanying Zhang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method for deblurring images affected by local motion blur through a specialized mask predictor and motion analyzer, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local motion blur caused by dynamic objects is challenging to deblur due to inefficient computational resource allocation and failure to address spatially varying blur patterns in existing methods.

Method: The method involves a trainable mask predictor to identify blurred regions, structural reparameterization for computational efficiency, and an intra-frame motion analyzer for adaptive blur restoration. It trains with a combination of reconstruction, reblur, and mask losses.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various datasets while reducing computation costs by 49% compared to LMD-ViT.

Conclusion: The paper presents an efficient and effective solution for handling local motion blur, demonstrating superior performance and significant computational efficiency improvements over current methods.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

*Jiale Zhao,Xinyang Jiang,Junyao Gao,Yuhao Xue,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrossVLAD, a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models, and proposes an efficient attack method, CRAFT, that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models bring advanced task flexibility, but face security challenges with adversarial inputs that remain effective across unpredictable task instructions. This paper aims to address these challenges systematically.

Method: The authors developed CrossVLAD, based on MSCOCO with GPT-4-assisted annotations, for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks. They also proposed CRAFT, an attack framework leveraging region-based token alignment for enhanced performance.

Result: CRAFT showed superior cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates in experiments with Florence-2 and other unified VLMs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The benchmark dataset and attack method introduced in the paper advance the study and mitigation of security challenges for unified vision-language models.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

*Ethan Dack,Chengliang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates dataset bias in popular chest X-ray datasets by performing a challenging task to identify overarching patterns of bias using simple transformations and various AI architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether bias exists in widely-used, open-source chest X-ray datasets given their importance in medical image AI research.

Method: The authors apply simple transformations to dataset samples and test various network architectures across four datasets (NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and PadChest) to evaluate the presence of dataset bias.

Result: The study demonstrates that bias persists in medical imaging datasets even under increased task difficulty using different deep learning models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for more explainable AI methods in medical imaging and push for the cultivation of diverse and unbiased open-source medical datasets.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Théo Danielou,Daniel Tordjman,Pierre Manceron,Corentin Dancette*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method inspired by SegVol, aiming to reduce inference complexity and manage large 3D volumetric data efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting 2D segmentation models, like SAM, to 3D volumetric data face challenges such as increased computational resources and complex inference strategies.

Method: The proposed method simplifies 3D segmentation by reducing inference time and eliminating complexities tied to sliding-window prompt management.

Result: The new approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance in handling 3D volumetric data such as CT and MRI scans.

Conclusion: This paper provides an efficient and high-performing solution for 3D promptable segmentation, easing the transition from 2D to 3D models while addressing the challenges of inference complexity and resource requirements.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

*Xixi Liu,Ailin Deng,Christopher Zach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in vision-language models by introducing an energy-based decoding method that improves accuracy and reduces bias across three visual question answering datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the critical problem of object hallucination in LVLMs, which impacts their safe deployment, and aims to address biases seen in the imbalance of 'Yes' ratio in VQA datasets.

Method: An energy-based decoding method is proposed, where hidden states with minimal energy scores are dynamically selected to reduce yes-ratio bias and enhance model performance.

Result: The proposed method consistently improves accuracy and F1 scores on three VQA datasets. It achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.82% over greedy decoding and decreases the yes-ratio gap by 8.81%.

Conclusion: The energy-based decoding method provides an effective solution to reduce bias and increase performance in LVLMs' object hallucination problem, demonstrating wide applicability in VQA scenarios.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for long video reasoning in vision-language models using reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance and releasing a versatile training system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reasoning over long videos by enhancing vision-language models' capabilities and optimizing their training processes.

Method: The framework includes a large dataset (LongVideo-Reason), a two-stage training process combining chain-of-thought fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and a specialized infrastructure (MR-SP) for efficient training on long videos.

Result: The LongVILA-R1-7B model shows strong performance on benchmarks, surpasses existing models in reasoning tasks, scales effectively with input frames, and achieves significant training speedups.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a notable step toward enhancing long video reasoning in VLMs, with significant practical and performance advantages. The release of the training system boosts accessibility for various applications.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST), an anchor-free side-tuning (ST) architecture with novel advancements for efficient video temporal grounding (VTG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTG methods predominantly depend on final-layer features of frozen pre-trained backbones, limiting domain adaptability. Full fine-tuning is resource-intensive, and existing side-tuning approaches fail to account for the sparse nature of moment retrieval in VTG.

Method: The authors propose SDST, an anchor-free ST architecture, integrating a Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention mechanism to enhance context modeling. Additionally, they effectively incorporate the InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework.

Result: The method significantly outperforms previous ST approaches, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on datasets like QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, with up to a 73% reduction in parameter count compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST) demonstrates substantial improvements in VTG by combining anchor-free architecture, enhanced attention mechanisms, and InternVideo2 backbone integration, offering efficient, scalable, and high-performing solutions.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeBench evaluates visual grounded reasoning with a focus on traceable evidence and complex interactions, showing leading models struggle to achieve accuracy above 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating visual grounded reasoning capabilities of models, particularly in complex scenes and interactions.

Method: TreeBench is created using high-quality images annotated by experts and introduces a new benchmark framework. A TreeVGR training paradigm using reinforcement learning is also introduced to improve reasoning and localization.

Result: TreeBench contains 405 challenging VQA pairs where leading models score less than 60%, while TreeVGR significantly improves performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traceability in visual grounded reasoning is crucial for advancing model performance, demonstrated by the improvement brought by TreeVGR in various benchmarks.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Method: X-RAFT utilizes modality-specific encoders and fine-tunes them self-supervisedly using flow-cycle-consistency on hyperspectral surgical data.

Result: X-RAFT reduces error by 36.6% compared to a naive baseline and 27.83% compared to an existing method (CrossRAFT).

Conclusion: X-RAFT effectively improves quantitative fluorescence measurement, supporting real-time surgical decision-making and enhancing neurosurgical outcomes.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning-based method to align CAD models with XCT scans, resolving geometric inaccuracies in additively manufactured components efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformation in additive manufacturing, which compromise component performance, and to improve quantitative registration between CAD models and XCT scans.

Method: The authors propose a deep learning-based approach with a dynamic patch-based processing strategy to estimate voxel-wise deformations between CAD and XCT volumes. They also introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) to quantify mismatches.

Result: The method achieves a 9.2% improvement in Dice Score and a 9.9% improvement in voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods, alongside drastically reduced processing times from days to minutes.

Conclusion: This approach enables more reliable and efficient additive manufacturing processes by providing accurate deformation estimates, potentially paving the way for closed-loop systems that save time and materials in industrial applications.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

### [147] [SCOOTER: A Human Evaluation Framework for Unrestricted Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07776)
*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SCOOTER, a framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks using human ratings and statistical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of statistically significant methods for assessing unrestricted adversarial attacks' imperceptibility to humans.

Method: SCOOTER combines human evaluations, automated model comparisons, and open-source tools including Python/R scripts and ImageNet-derived datasets.

Result: Empirical findings show that existing unrestricted attacks largely fail to produce imperceptible images, with models like GPT-4o detecting only 4 of 6 tested attacks.

Conclusion: A gap exists between automated systems and human perception; the SCOOTER benchmark establishes guidelines for aligning future evaluations.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

### [148] [Where are we with calibration under dataset shift in image classification?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07780)
*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines calibration methods for image classification under dataset shift, comparing post-hoc and in-training techniques for robustness and effectiveness, with insights for practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and provide practical guidelines for robust model calibration under real-world dataset shifts, addressing limitations in current methods for image classification.

Method: The study involved comparing post-hoc calibration methods and their interactions with in-training techniques across eight classification tasks and various dataset shifts, analyzing scenarios with foundation models, random classifiers, and ensemble methods.

Result: Entropy regularization combined with label smoothing provided superior calibration for shifted probabilities. Exposure of calibrators to a small amount of semantic OOD data enhanced robustness. Foundation models showed better calibration than models trained from scratch, while ensembling further improved calibration despite some trade-offs.

Conclusion: Calibration robustness under shift is best achieved through fine-tuning foundation models, using pre-ensembling calibration, and balancing ID vs OOD trade-offs. Simpler methods often outperform complex ones for post-hoc calibration strategies.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust method using 3D convolutional neural networks for remote heart rate measurement from facial videos, enhancing accuracy and generalization with innovations like differential frame fusion, Temporal Shift Module, and dynamic hybrid loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accuracy, robustness, and generalization of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) systems under complex scenarios for non-contact heart rate measurement.

Method: The authors proposed an end-to-end rPPG extraction network employing differential frame fusion, Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention, and a novel dynamic hybrid loss function for better feature extraction and effective network supervision.

Result: The proposed network demonstrated superior performance during evaluations on PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, achieving a significant reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) on complex scenarios compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The study establishes a highly robust and generalizable method for remote cardiac monitoring from facial videos, outperforming prior methods on standard benchmarks and challenging datasets.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

### [150] [Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07796)
*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), a method to enhance fine-tuning of vision transformers by combining dataset-level and instance-aware prompts, yielding improved performance and parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the performance issues of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for vision transformers, particularly the limitations of fixed dataset-level prompts in handling variance within downstream datasets.

Method: ViaPT generates instance-aware prompts individually for input data and fuses them with dataset-level prompts using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to maintain critical prompting information while optimizing the learnable parameters.

Result: ViaPT consistently outperforms existing baselines on 34 diverse datasets, demonstrating balanced acquisition of instance-level and dataset-level knowledge.

Conclusion: ViaPT establishes a novel approach that improves parameter-efficient fine-tuning for vision transformers by effectively balancing instance-specific and dataset-specific information in visual prompts.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

*Zhihui Zhang,Luanyuan Dai,Qika Lin,Yunfeng Diao,Guangyin Jin,Yufei Guo,Jing Zhang,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergistic Prompting (SyP), a framework targeting robust visual recognition amid missing modality conditions by combining dynamic and static prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researched issue is the performance drop in visual recognition models when faced with missing or incomplete modality inputs, which is critical for real-world applications.

Method: SyP employs two innovative components: a Dynamic Adapter for flexible prompt generation and a Synergistic Prompting Strategy to combine prompts for balanced modality information.

Result: SyP showed significant performance improvements over existing methods, validated through experiments and ablation studies across three datasets.

Conclusion: The framework proves effective in handling missing modalities, ensuring adaptability and reliability under diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

### [152] [Patient-specific vs Multi-Patient Vision Transformer for Markerless Tumor Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07811)
*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces Vision Transformer (ViT) models for markerless lung tumor motion forecasting in proton therapy, evaluating patient-specific (PS) and multi-patient (MP) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of transformer-based architectures in lung tumor motion forecasting despite their success in trajectory prediction. Accurate tumor tracking is crucial for effective proton therapy.

Method: The study utilized digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from 4DCT scans of 31 patients for training and one for evaluation. Both PS and MP models used 16 DRRs as input to predict 1-second tumor motion. Performance was evaluated using displacement error metrics on planning and treatment data.

Result: PS models performed better than MP models on planning data, especially with larger datasets, while MP models showed strong generalization to treatment data without retraining and demonstrated robustness to anatomical variability.

Conclusion: ViT-based approaches are effective for markerless lung tumor motion forecasting. PS models are more precise, but MP models provide robust performance suitable for time-restricted clinical environments.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

*Richard Dirauf,Florian Wolz,Dario Zanca,Björn Eskofier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates state-of-the-art content-based puzzle solvers under realistic conditions by introducing corruptions such as missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents. Deep learning models, notably the Positional Diffusion model, show improved robustness through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of puzzle solvers lack focus on realistic challenges necessary for practical applications, such as reconstructing fragmented artefacts or shredded documents.

Method: The paper introduces three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions—missing pieces, eroded edges, and eroded contents—analyzes heuristic and deep learning models, and evaluates their robustness.

Result: Standard puzzle solvers exhibit rapid performance declines as corruption increases. Deep learning models improve their robustness significantly, with the Positional Diffusion model outperforming competitors after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Real-world applications of puzzle solvers require improved robustness. Fine-tuned deep learning models offer promising avenues, especially the Positional Diffusion model, which shows superior adaptability in handling corruptions.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCIS introduces a novel approach to tackle class-incremental image segmentation (CIS) by addressing issues of input data order dependency and loss of plasticity, leveraging aggregated features and innovative mechanisms like cross-stage consistency and visual query-based replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve key inefficiencies in current class-incremental image segmentation methods, particularly their reliance on input data order and loss of adaptive plasticity during mask generation.

Method: SimCIS directly aligns query assignments with image features to preserve objectness while enabling adaptability to new classes. Additionally, it integrates cross-stage consistency and employs a visual query-based replay mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: SimCIS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation tasks, settings, and data orders, proving its effectiveness as a CIS baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed SimCIS framework provides significant advancements to class-incremental image segmentation, ensuring robust model performance and adaptability across varied settings, with full reproducibility via public codes and models.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

TL;DR: Manufacturing struggles with surface defect detection using existing datasets. The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a large-scale, realistic industrial dataset with RGB+3D anomaly annotations, designed to improve automated defect detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of surface defects in manufacturing is critical for improving yield and existing methods struggle with real-world applications due to the lack of representative datasets.

Method: Developed 3D-ADAM, a dataset with over 14,120 scans and defect annotations capturing diverse industrial scenarios including variations in lighting, object orientation, and occlusions.

Result: State-of-the-art anomaly detection models were tested on 3D-ADAM, revealing the challenges posed by real-world settings. Experts validated its industrial relevance through user surveys.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM provides a benchmark to foster innovation in robust defect detection techniques, enhancing industrial anomaly detection systems for widespread applications.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces THUNDER, a benchmarking platform for evaluating and comparing foundation models in digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of assessing progress in research fields like digital pathology, where concurrent methods emerge rapidly, requiring benchmarks that go beyond performance to include robustness and uncertainty.

Method: THUNDER is developed as a tile-level benchmark that compares 23 foundation models across 16 datasets, using diverse downstream tasks, feature analysis, and predictions' robustness and uncertainty.

Result: THUNDER enables efficient comparisons of models, supports state-of-the-art and user-defined models, and delivers insights into robustness and uncertainty in model predictions. It facilitates progress clarity in digital pathology.

Conclusion: THUNDER provides a dynamic and publicly accessible benchmark platform to foster reliable evaluation and advancement in digital pathology foundation models.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLURPP, a new underwater image restoration methodology that outperforms existing methods in speed and accuracy using a novel synthetic data generation pipeline and network architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing underwater image restoration to address limitations of existing pixel-domain diffusion methods, which struggle with computational intensity and generate artifacts in scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation.

Method: Introduces SLURPP, a network architecture that fuses pretrained latent diffusion models (encoding strong priors of depth and geometry) with explicit scene decomposition to model underwater light attenuation and backscattering. Utilizes a physics-based synthetic data generation pipeline to create realistic underwater degradation effects for training.

Result: SLURPP achieves state-of-the-art performance, being significantly faster (200x) than existing diffusion-based methods while improving PSNR by ~3 dB on synthetic benchmarks. It also shows qualitative enhancements on real-world underwater images.

Conclusion: SLURPP successfully addresses the current challenges in underwater image restoration, providing a more efficient and accurate restoration method, and has potential for broad application in underwater image processing.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Motivation: Multimodal large language models often produce factually incorrect outcomes in medical diagnosis, stemming from limitations in existing retrieval-augmented generation methods that either miss critical information or over-rely on external data.

Method: MIRA incorporates two key components: a calibrated module for dynamically adjusting retrieved context quantity and a multimodal medical framework combining image embeddings, a medical knowledge base, and query-rewriting for refined reasoning.

Result: MIRA improves factual accuracy and performance on benchmarks for medical VQA and report generation, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MIRA framework successfully addresses the challenges of factual inconsistency in medical diagnosis by optimizing retrieval and integration processes, improving both accuracy and overall performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

*Mateusz Wasala,Mateusz Smolarczyk,Michal Danilowicz,Tomasz Kryjak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a resource-efficient, embedded system implementation of a Visual SLAM architecture based on a quantized convolutional neural network, achieving high performance on FPGA platforms with minimal computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dependence of modern autonomous navigation systems on precise location estimation drives the need for efficient and reliable extraction of feature points from visual input, especially for resource-constrained platforms like mobile or embedded systems.

Method: An unsupervised, embedded system employing a quantized version of the SuperPoint convolutional neural network was implemented and tested on an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform. Techniques like model quantization, hardware-aware optimization, the Brevitas library, and the FINN framework were utilized to enhance performance.

Result: The system processed 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 frames per second on an AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA, surpassing existing solutions. Its performance and accuracy were validated using the TUM dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed quantized, hardware-optimized architecture successfully balances computational efficiency with high detection quality, making it suitable for deployment on resource-limited platforms in Visual SLAM applications.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

*Xiao Yang,Yuxuan Fan,Can Liu,Houcheng Su,Weichen Guo,Jiyao Wang,Dengbo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework for improving remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) models, achieving state-of-the-art real-time adaptation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation techniques for rPPG models face limitations in deployment due to privacy concerns and real-time adaptability needs.

Method: The paper introduces a self-supervised CiCi framework leveraging spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency priors, along with gradient dynamic control for stable adaptation.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrate superior real-time self-supervised model adaptation without requiring access to source data.

Conclusion: The proposed CiCi framework establishes improved adaptability for rPPG tasks, making the approach viable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

TL;DR: The paper develops a real-time identification algorithm for individual laboratory mice using custom ear tags, enhancing behavioral and physiological monitoring in home cages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data accuracy and animal welfare through automated home cage monitoring and overcome obstacles in identifying individual mice due to their housing density, appearance similarity, high mobility, and frequent interactions.

Method: A pipeline combining a custom multi-object tracker (MouseTracks), a transformer-based classifier (Mouseformer), and a tracklet associator linear program (MouseMap) for assigning IDs based on ear tags.

Result: The proposed pipeline accomplished real-time ID assignments at 30 frames per second with continuous cage monitoring, demonstrating improved tracking efficiency and reduced ID switches compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The methods presented are effective for addressing challenges in tracking and identifying individual mice, enhancing the ability to monitor their behavior and physiological states continuously.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of generating realistic Martian landscape videos by introducing a two-component system: a 3D reconstruction pipeline and a Martian terrain video generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery make it challenging to simulate realistic Martian landscapes for mission rehearsals and robotic operations.

Method: The authors propose a two-fold approach: M3arsSynth reconstructs 3D Martian environments using NASA data to generate 3D video sequences, while MarsGen synthesizes visually and geometrically accurate videos based on an initial frame and additional inputs.

Result: Their approach surpasses existing video synthesis methods, achieving higher visual fidelity and 3D structural accuracy for Martian terrains.

Conclusion: The proposed solution aids in generating realistic Martian videos for simulations, leveraging both real Martian data and advanced video generation techniques to bridge domain gaps.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

*Haoyu Wu,Diankun Wu,Tianyu He,Junliang Guo,Yang Ye,Yueqi Duan,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the deficiency of video diffusion models in capturing 3D geometric representations by introducing Geometry Forcing, which ensures geometry-aware intermediate representations, improving the quality and 3D consistency of generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze why video diffusion models fail to encapsulate 3D geometric structure and propose a solution to bridge the gap, enabling the models to better reflect the 3D nature of the physical world.

Method: The proposed Geometry Forcing method aligns intermediate model representations with a pretrained geometric foundation model using two techniques: Angular Alignment (cosine similarity-based alignment) and Scale Alignment (ensuring consistency of scale-related features).

Result: Experiments indicate that Geometry Forcing significantly enhances both the visual fidelity and 3D consistency of videos generated in camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned tasks.

Conclusion: The Geometry Forcing method effectively integrates 3D geometric-aware representations into video diffusion models, overcoming their limitations and improving overall generation quality.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OST-Bench introduces a benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models under online spatio-temporal scenarios, revealing their shortcomings in dynamic spatial reasoning and memory retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a more realistic benchmark for active online scene exploration, addressing existing limitations of offline evaluations in multimodal large language models.

Method: The authors created a benchmark named OST-Bench with 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs from datasets like ScanNet and Matterport3D. It tests models' incremental visual processing and memory integration.

Result: Current multimodal large language models show performance degradation in tasks requiring extensive exploration and long-term memory, highlighting core challenges in online embodied reasoning.

Conclusion: OST-Bench advances research by emphasizing spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic environments, offering insights into improving model capabilities and providing resources to the community for further development.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

### [166] [CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985)
*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies why CLIP struggles with binding visually similar objects, concluding that data properties like attribute density and saliency bias are key factors affecting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to address the limitations in CLIP's ability to distinguish complex object relationships in images due to poor data representation.

Method: They use a synthetic dataset to analyze how various data properties influence CLIP's binding performance.

Result: Low attribute density, incomplete captions, and saliency bias are identified as limiting factors for binding in CLIP models.

Conclusion: Adjusting data properties, rather than increasing batch size or hard negatives, is crucial for improving CLIP's object-binding capabilities.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free method, STTM, to efficiently reduce spatio-temporal tokens for video large language models without significant accuracy loss, enhancing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of quadratic computational scaling caused by spatio-temporal tokens in video large language models while maintaining strong video understanding.

Method: The proposed STTM method reduces tokens by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancy. It uses a coarse-to-fine token merging strategy utilizing a quadtree structure spatially and directed pairwise merging temporally.

Result: STTM achieves high efficiency, offering a 2x speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop at a 50% token budget and a 3x speed-up with a 2% accuracy drop at a 30% token budget across six video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: STTM is a query-agnostic, highly efficient method for token reduction in video LLMs, enabling significant speed-ups with minimal accuracy sacrifice and allowing for KV cache reuse.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty of few-shot keypoint detection when source data from the same distribution as the query isn't available.

Method: The framework utilizes a prototypical setup, a grid-based locator, and prototypical domain adaptation to address cross-modal embedding and style variance issues.

Result: Extensive experiments show effective few-shot convergence for novel keypoints and classes.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap in few-shot keypoint detection by leveraging sketches and addressing major challenges in the process.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents KARL, a single-pass adaptive image tokenizer inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, achieving similar performance to existing methods without multi-pass testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed-length visual representation systems and the inefficiencies of current adaptive tokenization methods that require test-time search, leveraging principles from Algorithmic Information Theory.

Method: KARL is a single-pass adaptive tokenizer that halts tokenization based on the approximate Kolmogorov Complexity of an image, using a training procedure resembling Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning to conditionally predict token halting.

Result: KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenization methods while operating in a single pass and demonstrates alignment of predicted image complexity with human intuition across various axes.

Conclusion: KARL provides an efficient, adaptive tokenization approach inspired by Algorithmic Information Theory, highlighting a practical method to incorporate notions of Kolmogorov Complexity into visual representation systems.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in reconstruction quality between VQ-VAEs and traditional VAEs by enhancing the representation capability of discrete codebooks in VQ-VAEs.

Method: Proposing retention of latent dimensions to preserve encoded features, incorporation of sub-codebooks for efficient quantization, and introducing comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks.

Result: \NickName achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and outperforms existing methods in zero-shot benchmarks with significant improvements in metrics like rFID and PSNR.

Conclusion: \NickName effectively bridges the gap in reconstruction quality, offering a robust solution for high-resolution image processing tasks using VQ-VAEs.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD
image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available at

### [171] [Impact of Pretraining Word Co-occurrence on Compositional Generalization in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08000)
*Helen Qu,Sang Michael Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how word co-occurrence statistics in training data impact the compositional generalization of CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs), showing a strong correlation between word co-occurrence metrics and model performance on concept pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of concept combinations in the training data on compositional generalization in CLIP and LMMs, addressing their dependency on word co-occurrence rather than just concept frequency.

Method: The authors measure co-occurrence using pointwise mutual information (PMI) and evaluate its effect on model performance by testing synthetically generated and natural images with varying PMI values.

Result: They observe that higher PMI values strongly correlate with better zero-shot accuracy — revealing a 14% accuracy gap between top and bottom PMI percentiles in CLIP and similar correlations in other LMMs like TextVQA and VQAv2.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of improving compositional generalization in multimodal models without exponentially increasing training data. Improved architectures are necessary to overcome current dependencies on concept co-occurrence.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

### [172] [Compute Can't Handle the Truth: Why Communication Tax Prioritizes Memory and Interconnects in Modern AI Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07223)
*Myoungsoo Jung*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses scalability challenges in modern AI infrastructures. It introduces a modular data center architecture using CXL and XLink to alleviate memory and inter-GPU communication bottlenecks, leading to improved scaling and performance in AI workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of traditional GPU-centric architectures in scaling modern AI workloads, particularly large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, which demand high memory and communication bandwidth.

Method: The authors propose a modular data center architecture incorporating Compute Express Link (CXL) and accelerator-optimized interconnects (XLink). They also introduce a hybrid CXL-over-XLink design and explore hierarchical memory models combining local and pooled memory.

Result: The proposed architecture demonstrates enhanced scalability, throughput, and flexibility in AI infrastructures according to evaluations.

Conclusion: Modular scaling with CXL and improved interconnects like XLink can overcome traditional GPU-centric architecture limitations, enabling effective support for modern AI workloads.

Abstract: Modern AI workloads such as large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) impose severe demands on memory,
communication bandwidth, and resource flexibility. Traditional GPU-centric
architectures struggle to scale due to growing inter-GPU communication
overheads. This report introduces key AI concepts and explains how Transformers
revolutionized data representation in LLMs. We analyze large-scale AI hardware
and data center designs, identifying scalability bottlenecks in hierarchical
systems. To address these, we propose a modular data center architecture based
on Compute Express Link (CXL) that enables disaggregated scaling of memory,
compute, and accelerators. We further explore accelerator-optimized
interconnects-collectively termed XLink (e.g., UALink, NVLink, NVLink
Fusion)-and introduce a hybrid CXL-over-XLink design to reduce long-distance
data transfers while preserving memory coherence. We also propose a
hierarchical memory model that combines local and pooled memory, and evaluate
lightweight CXL implementations, HBM, and silicon photonics for efficient
scaling. Our evaluations demonstrate improved scalability, throughput, and
flexibility in AI infrastructure.

### [173] [Distributed Training under Packet Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07114)
*Erez Weintraub,Ron Banner,Ariel Orda*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distributed training framework that ensures accurate and efficient model training over unreliable connections, leveraging unbiased gradient aggregation and controlled parameter drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing distributed frameworks, which struggle with scalability and inflating tail latencies under unreliable network connections.

Method: The approach consists of (i) unbiased gradient aggregation for reconstructing consistent gradient estimates and (ii) bounded-drift parameter broadcasts to maintain controlled inter-worker discrepancies.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that even with 10% random packet loss, the LLAMA2 7B model trained using this framework experienced only up to 0.8% increase in perplexity.

Conclusion: The method bridges communication-efficient protocols with the needs of large-model training, enabling robust performance on commodity or wide-area networks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

### [174] [Analysing semantic data storage in Distributed Ledger Technologies for Data Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07116)
*Juan Cano-Benito,Andrea Cimmino,Sven Hertling,Heiko Paulheim,Raúl García-Castro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the storage of semantic data across different distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to aid decentralized data exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in efficient storage of semantic data when using distributed ledger technologies in decentralized data spaces.

Method: A systematic evaluation comparing performance, storage efficiency, resource consumption, update capabilities, and query capabilities across different types of DLTs using a real-world knowledge graph.

Result: Private DLTs are most efficient for storing and managing semantic data, while hybrid DLTs offer a balance between public auditability and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of choosing appropriate DLT infrastructure based on data sovereignty needs in decentralized data ecosystems.

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

### [175] [Collective Communication Profiling of Modern-day Machine Learning Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07117)
*Jit Gupta,Andrew Li,Tarun Banka,Ariel Cohen,T. Sridhar,Raj Yavatkar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes collective communication behavior in distributed ML workloads by studying traffic patterns and their network impact, using instrumentation for deeper insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address network congestion and packet loss caused by periodic communication patterns in distributed machine learning tasks, improving their performance.

Method: The researchers instrumented Nvidia Collective Communication Library to log and analyze communication patterns under various configurations, focusing on different models like DeepSeek V3.

Result: Patterns included operation types, counts, transfer sizes, and request size distributions. This highlights issues in existing frameworks and suggests potential redesigns.

Conclusion: Current networking frameworks and topologies need reconsideration to prevent inefficiencies and anomalies in distributed ML workload communications.

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

### [176] [Helix Parallelism: Rethinking Sharding Strategies for Interactive Multi-Million-Token LLM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07120)
*Nidhi Bhatia,Ankit More,Ritika Borkar,Tiyasa Mitra,Ramon Matas,Ritchie Zhao,Maximilian Golub,Dheevatsa Mudigere,Brian Pharris,Bita Darvish Rouhani*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy designed to improve real-time decoding efficiency for large-scale LLMs while maintaining low Token-to-Token Latency (TTL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from inefficiencies in scaling autoregressive decoding for LLMs with multi-million-token KV histories, particularly due to Feed-Forward Network (FFN) bottlenecks and DRAM reads for KV caches.

Method: The paper presents Helix Parallelism, which combines KV parallelism during attention for GPU-based cache sharing with Tensor Parallelism (TP) or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) during FFN computation, alongside Helix HOP-B for reducing communication costs.

Result: Helix Parallelism achieves up to 1.5x reduction in TTL and supports batch sizes 32x larger under the same latency budget compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Helix Parallelism advances throughput-latency trade-offs, enabling practical real-time inference with ultra-long sequence lengths on modern hardware like Blackwell GPUs.

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at
fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency
budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on
Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

### [177] [Ampere: Communication-Efficient and High-Accuracy Split Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07130)
*Zihan Zhang,Leon Wong,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Ampere is a new system for Split Federated Learning that minimizes computation and communication costs while improving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in FL systems caused by high on-device computation costs and SFL systems' large communication overheads and reduced accuracy for non-IID data.

Method: Ampere uses unidirectional inter-block training with local loss and auxiliary network generation methods to decouple training between devices and servers, minimizing communication and computation needs.

Result: Ampere improves model accuracy by up to 13.26%, reduces training time by up to 94.6%, cuts device-server communication by up to 99.1%, reduces on-device computation by up to 93.13%, and lowers accuracy variance for non-IID data by 53.39%.

Conclusion: Ampere significantly enhances both performance and efficiency in federated learning tasks, especially under conditions of heterogeneous data.

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

### [178] [M$^2$-MFP: A Multi-Scale and Multi-Level Memory Failure Prediction Framework for Reliable Cloud Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07144)
*Hongyi Xie,Min Zhou,Qiao Yu,Jialiang Yu,Zhenli Sheng,Hong Xie,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces M$^2$-MFP, a novel multi-scale hierarchical framework for predicting memory failures in cloud infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate memory failure prediction stems from the increasing reliance on cloud services and the limitations of existing methods, which include low generalizability of rule-based models and poor performance of automated features extraction techniques.

Method: The proposed method includes converting memory error logs into multi-level binary matrix representations, using a Binary Spatial Feature Extractor (BSFE) for feature extraction, and employing a dual-path temporal modeling architecture for aggregation and rule generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that M$^2$-MFP significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on both benchmark datasets and real-world cloud environments.

Conclusion: The proposed M$^2$-MFP framework provides a more effective and advanced solution for enhancing the reliability and availability of cloud infrastructure through improved memory failure prediction.

Abstract: As cloud services become increasingly integral to modern IT infrastructure,
ensuring hardware reliability is essential to sustain high-quality service.
Memory failures pose a significant threat to overall system stability, making
accurate failure prediction through the analysis of memory error logs (i.e.,
Correctable Errors) imperative. Existing memory failure prediction approaches
have notable limitations: rule-based expert models suffer from limited
generalizability and low recall rates, while automated feature extraction
methods exhibit suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we
propose M$^2$-MFP: a Multi-scale and hierarchical memory failure prediction
framework designed to enhance the reliability and availability of cloud
infrastructure. M$^2$-MFP converts Correctable Errors (CEs) into multi-level
binary matrix representations and introduces a Binary Spatial Feature Extractor
(BSFE) to automatically extract high-order features at both DIMM-level and
bit-level. Building upon the BSFE outputs, we develop a dual-path temporal
modeling architecture: 1) a time-patch module that aggregates multi-level
features within observation windows, and 2) a time-point module that employs
interpretable rule-generation trees trained on bit-level patterns. Experiments
on both benchmark datasets and real-world deployment show the superiority of
M$^2$-MFP as it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by significant
margins. Code and data are available at this repository:

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuMMI, a workflow management system for orchestrating multiscale machine-learned modeling tasks, and its scaled-down version "mini-MuMMI" for resource-efficient systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to address the challenge of bridging different time and length scales in complex phenomena, leveraging machine learning for computational efficiency and multiscale modeling.

Method: The authors developed MuMMI, a massively parallel infrastructure, and its simplified variant, mini-MuMMI, to manage multiscale molecular dynamics simulations.

Result: Using mini-MuMMI, the authors successfully explored RAS-RAF membrane interactions and showcased its applicability beyond molecular dynamics.

Conclusion: Mini-MuMMI extends the accessibility of multiscale modeling workflows, opening new avenues for broader applications, even on modest computational systems.

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

### [180] [KVFlow: Efficient Prefix Caching for Accelerating LLM-Based Multi-Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07400)
*Zaifeng Pan,Ajjkumar Patel,Zhengding Hu,Yipeng Shen,Yue Guan,Wan-Lu Li,Lianhui Qin,Yida Wang,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: KVFlow enhances cache management in LLM-based agentic workflows by using a workflow-aware eviction strategy and proactive prefetching, resulting in significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in current KV caching systems used in large language model-based workflows, particularly the challenge of frequent cache misses due to suboptimal eviction policies.

Method: The authors propose KVFlow, which utilizes an Agent Step Graph to estimate agent proximity to future activation for fine-grained eviction. Additionally, it includes a prefetching mechanism to pre-load tensor data proactively.

Result: KVFlow demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving up to 1.83× speedup for single workflows and 2.19× for concurrent scenarios compared to existing caching solutions.

Conclusion: KVFlow effectively reduces cache miss rates and improves workflow execution efficiency, particularly for applications with large prompts or multiple agents.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agentic workflows have become a popular
paradigm for coordinating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks.
To improve serving efficiency, existing LLM systems employ prefix caching to
reuse key-value (KV) tensors corresponding to agents' fixed prompts, thereby
avoiding redundant computation across repeated invocations. However, current
systems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,
which fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches
shortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial
recomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV
cache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the
agent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a
steps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future
activation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node
level, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently
manage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a
fully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required
tensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next
step, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation. Compared to SGLang
with hierarchical radix cache, KVFlow achieves up to 1.83$\times$ speedup for
single workflows with large prompts, and up to 2.19$\times$ speedup for
scenarios with many concurrent workflows.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes MARLISE, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based solution for dynamic resource scaling in edge-cloud systems, using Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of traditional, static scaling methods in dynamic environments and the need for improved resource utilization and performance in edge-cloud infrastructures.

Method: The solution uses reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization) for implementing dynamic and in-place resource scaling.

Result: MARLISE demonstrates better response times for microservices, scalability under dynamic workloads, and improved resource efficiency compared to heuristic methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MARLISE method enhances resource elasticity, microservice response times, and overall efficiency in edge-cloud systems, addressing limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Modern edge-cloud systems face challenges in efficiently scaling resources to
handle dynamic and unpredictable workloads. Traditional scaling approaches
typically rely on static thresholds and predefined rules, which are often
inadequate for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance in
distributed and dynamic environments. This inefficiency hinders the
adaptability and performance required in edge-cloud infrastructures, which can
only be achieved through the newly proposed in-place scaling. To address this
problem, we propose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based In-place
Scaling Engine (MARLISE) that enables seamless, dynamic, reactive control with
in-place resource scaling. We develop our solution using two Deep Reinforcement
Learning algorithms: Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). We analyze each version of the proposed MARLISE solution using dynamic
workloads, demonstrating their ability to ensure low response times of
microservices and scalability. Our results show that MARLISE-based approaches
outperform heuristic method in managing resource elasticity while maintaining
microservice response times and achieving higher resource efficiency.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in autoscaling GPU inference workloads in Kubernetes using KIS-S, a framework integrating a GPU-aware simulator and a PPO-based autoscaler, achieving significant improvements in latency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of reactive and threshold-based autoscaling mechanisms in Kubernetes, which struggle with dynamic, bursty traffic and lack GPU-level integration.

Method: The authors introduce KIS-S, comprising KISim (a GPU-aware Kubernetes Inference Simulator) and KIScaler (a PPO-based autoscaler that scales policy learning in simulation and deploys without retraining).

Result: KIScaler improves average reward by 75.2%, reduces P95 latency by up to 6.7 times compared to CPU-based baselines, and generalizes scaling policies across varied traffic patterns without retraining.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between traditional reactive autoscaling methods and intelligent orchestration for scalable GPU-accelerated workloads in Kubernetes, showcasing the superiority of KIS-S in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Autoscaling GPU inference workloads in Kubernetes remains challenging due to
the reactive and threshold-based nature of default mechanisms such as the
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which struggle under dynamic and bursty
traffic patterns and lack integration with GPU-level metrics. We present KIS-S,
a unified framework that combines KISim, a GPU-aware Kubernetes Inference
Simulator, with KIScaler, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based
autoscaler. KIScaler learns latency-aware and resource-efficient scaling
policies entirely in simulation, and is directly deployed without retraining.
Experiments across four traffic patterns show that KIScaler improves average
reward by 75.2%, reduces P95 latency up to 6.7x over CPU baselines, and
generalizes without retraining. Our work bridges the gap between reactive
autoscaling and intelligent orchestration for scalable GPU-accelerated
environments.

### [183] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular and layer-wise approach to building large language models (LLMs) using fixed, deterministic embeddings instead of traditional monolithic training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and inflexibility of current scaling paradigms for large language models by exploring alternative, resource-efficient methods.

Method: The authors propose two methods: combining specialist models into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) via averaging output logits, and progressively growing a deep Transformer layer by layer using deterministic embeddings.

Result: These methods show improved performance on reasoning tasks without catastrophic forgetting and stable convergence, with depth correlating to enhanced reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The study suggests a shift from monolithic training towards an incremental, modular development model, enabling resource-efficient scaling and a more democratized AI ecosystem.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

### [184] [Scale leads to compositional generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07207)
*Florian Redhardt,Yassir Akram,Simon Schug*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether neural networks can generalize to compositional tasks, finding that scaling data and model size enables compositional generalization, and showing that task constituents can be linearly decoded from activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and what it takes for neural networks to generalize over tasks with shared compositional structures.

Method: The study scales data and model size, analyzes training distributions, proves approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptrons, and evaluates linear decodability of task constituents.

Result: Scaling model size and data enables neural networks to generalize compositional tasks. Generalization correlates with linearly decodable constituents in hidden activations, applicable to text-to-image models.

Conclusion: Neural networks can achieve compositional generalization with sufficient scaling and training distribution coverage, having implications for understanding and designing AI models.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FACap, a large-scale dataset focusing on fashion-domain image retrieval, and FashionBLIP-2, a specialized model leveraging this dataset to improve retrieval accuracy in e-commerce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing composed image retrieval methods that use large vision-language models struggle with the fine-grained concepts and vocabulary specific to domains like fashion. Additionally, creating annotated datasets for these domains is difficult due to the high costs.

Method: The authors create FACap, a fashion-domain dataset with automatically annotated modification texts via a VLM and LLM pipeline. They also propose FashionBLIP-2, a fine-tuned BLIP-2 model with lightweight adapters and multi-head matching for fashion-specific understanding.

Result: The combination of the FACap dataset and the FashionBLIP-2 model achieves significant improvements in fashion image retrieval tasks, as demonstrated on both the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced enhFashionIQ dataset.

Conclusion: FACap and FashionBLIP-2 effectively address the challenges in fashion CIR by catering to fine-grained and domain-specific requirements, showcasing their utility in demanding environments like e-commerce.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

*Zhengyu Tian,Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar,Hemant Krishnakumar,Reza Rawassizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 architecture, evaluating energy efficiency and resource demands during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of rigorous evaluation of energy usage and hardware demands of efficient attention mechanisms in large language models and visual language models.

Method: The authors benchmarked eight attention mechanisms in GPT-2 architecture, measuring metrics like training time, GPU memory usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption.

Result: The study found mechanisms like Flash Attention, LSH Attention, and MLA to be the most energy-efficient, emphasizing the role of both GPU power and training time in energy usage.

Conclusion: Energy-aware benchmarking is crucial in attention mechanism design, providing insights for selecting resource-efficient approaches.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

### [187] [Automating Evaluation of Diffusion Model Unlearning with (Vision-) Language Model World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07137)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Henry Kvinge,Timothy Doster,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "autoeval-dmun," an automated tool for evaluating machine unlearning (MU) effectiveness in diffusion models by leveraging vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ensuring complete information removal during MU and mitigating potential performance damage to surrounding concepts in diffusion models.

Method: The proposed tool extracts structured, relevant knowledge from language models to systematically identify related concepts potentially impacted by unlearning and to generate adversarial prompts for evaluation.

Result: Analyses revealed that language models effectively detect concept damage and create synthetic prompts to test the robustness of MU methods.

Conclusion: "Autoeval-dmun" facilitates evaluating and improving MU processes, ensuring model integrity and reliability while advancing diffusion model deployment.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SP4LP, a new framework that improves link prediction accuracy by combining graph neural network (GNN) representations with sequence modeling over shortest paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GNNs struggle with link prediction as they often fail to capture subgraph structural patterns between node pairs by relying only on node-centric message-passing schemes.

Method: SP4LP first computes node representations using GNNs, then extracts the shortest path between candidate node pairs and processes the sequence of node embeddings with a sequence model.

Result: SP4LP outperforms existing methods on link prediction benchmarks in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: SP4LP is a novel and more expressive framework than traditional GNNs and state-of-the-art structural methods, establishing itself as a general and effective approach for link prediction.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

*Samin Yeasar Arnob,Zhan Su,Minseon Kim,Oleksiy Ostapenko,Riyasat Ohib,Esra'a Saleh,Doina Precup,Lucas Caccia,Alessandro Sordoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores sparse adapters as an alternative to LoRA for building modular architectures in NLP tasks and finds them superior in merging multiple task adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate more efficient and scalable modular architectures for rapid task adaptation without requiring extensive fine-tuning.

Method: The authors propose a simple method to train sparse adapters by training only a subset of weights in the neural network and compare their merging properties with LoRA and full fine-tuning on up to 20 NLP tasks.

Result: Sparse adapters outperform LoRA and full fine-tuning in in-distribution performance after merging tasks but share challenges with all methods in achieving strong held-out performance.

Conclusion: Sparse adapters are a promising alternative for parameter-efficient modular architectures, offering better scalability and performance in merging tasks, although challenges remain for held-out generalization.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

### [190] [Str-GCL: Structural Commonsense Driven Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07141)
*Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Xiaobao Wang,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL), which incorporates structural commonsense through first-order logic rules to improve graph representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods overlook structural commonsense, which contains crucial knowledge for effective representation learning.

Method: The proposed Str-GCL framework explicitly incorporates structural commonsense using first-order logic rules, applying topological and attribute-based rules without modifying the original graph, and enhances representation alignment to guide the encoder.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that Str-GCL significantly outperforms existing GCL methods.

Conclusion: Str-GCL successfully integrates structural commonsense into GCL, setting a new direction for graph representation learning and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

### [191] [TRIP: A Nonparametric Test to Diagnose Biased Feature Importance Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07276)
*Aaron Foote,Danny Krizanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of misleading permutation feature importance in machine learning models, especially under dependent features. It proposes a method called TRIP to detect unreliable feature importance scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Features are crucial for prediction in machine learning, yet current methods like permutation feature importance can be misleading under dependent conditions.

Method: The authors develop TRIP, a test method requiring minimal assumptions, to detect unreliable scores caused by model extrapolation when features are dependent.

Result: Simulations and practical applications illustrate that TRIP can reliably identify misleading permutation feature importance scores.

Conclusion: TRIP offers a reliable solution to ensure trustworthy interpretation in machine learning models, overcoming limitations of permutation feature importance in dependent feature settings.

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

*Karthik Pappu,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses scientific machine learning, specifically Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), to model and analyze malware propagation. UDEs outperform traditional and neural models by reducing prediction errors and maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional and neural approaches in accurately modeling malware propagation, especially in capturing nonlinear feedback mechanisms in real-world networks.

Method: Three modeling approaches are evaluated: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Data from the Code Red worm outbreak is used, and symbolic recovery techniques translate learned neural feedback into mathematical expressions.

Result: The UDE method reduced prediction errors by 44% compared to traditional and neural baselines. Additionally, it uncovered suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security responses, and malware variant evolution.

Conclusion: Physics-informed hybrid models, such as UDEs, offer superior predictive accuracy and insight into malware dynamics over purely analytical or neural methods, aiding in the design of defenses and response strategies.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

*Zheyu Zhang,Jiayuan Dong,Jie Liu,Xun Huan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GO-CBED is a Bayesian framework that optimizes experimental design by targeting specific causal queries, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and focus in causal experimental design by targeting specific research questions rather than inferring a complete causal model.

Method: The framework uses a Bayesian approach to maximize expected information gain (EIG) for user-specified causal queries. It combines transformer-based policy networks and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors for efficient real-time intervention planning.

Result: GO-CBED surpasses existing methods in various tasks such as causal reasoning and gene regulatory network discovery, especially in resource-limited and complex causal settings.

Conclusion: Aligning experimental design with specific goals and utilizing forward-looking planning leads to more efficient and effective causal discovery.

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

### [194] [CCQ: Convolutional Code for Extreme Low-bit Quantization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07145)
*Zhaojing Zhou,Xunchao Li,Minghao Li,Handi Zhang,Haoshuang Wang,Wenbin Chang,Yiqun Liu,Qingqing Dang,Dianhai Yu,Yanjun Ma,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), a method to quantize Large Language Models (LLMs) to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss, addressing scalability, speed, and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the increasing inference costs and deployment barriers for LLMs, especially when quantizing models to sub-3-bit levels where current methods struggle with accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces CCQ, an inference-optimized quantization method utilizing hardware-aware bit-shift encoding, Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster. It establishes a lookup-free encoding space for efficient linear mapping while minimizing model degradation under extremely low-bit conditions.

Result: CCQ achieves high performance across benchmarks, enabling significant compression of LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3 from 671B to 184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB). It supports single-GPU deployment and eliminates inter-card communication for ERNIE models.

Conclusion: CCQ offers a robust solution for extreme quantization, maintaining accuracy while drastically reducing deployment costs and hardware requirements. The method and 2-bit ERNIE model have been open-sourced for broader adoption.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-Guard, a GNN-based classifier, to combat multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs, leveraging entity graphs and attention-aware mechanisms for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) subjected to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, which evade detection by escalating harmful dialogue gradually.

Method: The proposed G-Guard uses a GNN-based approach that builds entity graphs to map harmful keywords from multi-turn conversations. It also employs attention-aware augmentation to retrieve and utilize similar single-turn queries as labeled nodes for improved classification.

Result: G-Guard demonstrates superior performance across various datasets and metrics compared to all baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights G-Guard's efficacy in detecting and mitigating multi-turn jailbreak attacks, ensuring enhanced safety for LLM applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data, which commonly occur in statistical learning, by deriving advanced inequalities to improve estimation.

Method: The authors derive data-dependent Bernstein inequalities for vector-valued processes in Hilbert spaces, applicable to both stationary and non-stationary processes, emphasizing reduced correlation effects. Applications include covariance operator estimation and operator learning.

Result: The application of the proposed inequalities led to novel risk bounds for covariance operator estimation (using the Hilbert-Schmidt norm) and operator learning in dynamical systems. Numerical experiments corroborate practical usefulness.

Conclusion: The paper offers new tools (data-dependent Bernstein inequalities) for dealing with non-i.i.d data in Hilbert spaces, providing theoretical insights and practical demonstrations of improved estimation techniques.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeMul, a method to use multi-prompt learning for improving Vision Language Model performance, without requiring descriptions from Large Language Models, achieving better results on 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations in existing methods that extract descriptions from Large Language Models for Vision Language Models, which often produce unreliable and variable outputs.

Method: The proposed Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul) directly distills LLM knowledge into continuous vector prompts and adopts a multi-prompt setup with prompt weighting for optimizing training importance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that their method surpasses existing systems' performance on 11 recognition datasets, proving its robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: DeMul offers a description-free solution leveraging rich semantic knowledge in prompts, improving downstream task performance while eliminating reliance on predefined templates.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

*Haichen Hu,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'model elasticity' for analyzing the impact of imputed covariates on regret in decision-making and demonstrates that calibration improves outcomes under MAR settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in sequential decision-making when certain covariates are missing, exploring how pre-trained AI models for imputation impact the process.

Method: The authors define and analyze 'model elasticity,' use tools like orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression, and introduce a calibration method under the MAR setting.

Result: Researchers show that calibration significantly improves the quality of imputed covariates and reduces regret in contextual decision-making.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of accurate pre-trained models and positions 'model elasticity' as a key metric for integrating them in real-world tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

*Huibo Xu,Runlong Yu,Likang Wu,Xianquan Wang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), a novel approach for time series forecasting that significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models in time series forecasting are hindered by rigid source distributions and fixed sampling paths, which limit their generative abilities.

Method: The proposed CGFM method extends flow matching techniques by integrating outputs from auxiliary models and utilizing a flexible two-sided conditional probability path with general affine paths.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm that CGFM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art models in time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that CGFM effectively leverages auxiliary model errors and advanced probability path design, setting a new benchmark in the field of forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), an architecture that efficiently combines multiple pre-trained model embeddings for Reinforcement Learning (RL), achieving a balance between performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While pre-trained models have transformed fields like NLP and Computer Vision by learning insightful representations, RL agents traditionally learn from scratch or rely on computationally heavy foundational models. This work aims to address the gap in leveraging multiple pre-trained models efficiently in RL.

Method: The authors propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA), a novel architecture designed to combine embeddings from multiple pre-trained models into a unified enriched state representation.

Result: WSA demonstrates comparable performance to end-to-end models across multiple Atari games. Additionally, the study evaluates its generalization capabilities and investigates the impact of scaling the number of pre-trained models on agent performance.

Conclusion: WSA proves to be a promising approach for integrating multiple pre-trained models into RL, striking a balance between computational efficiency and task performance with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations of the PAC learning framework by enhancing the prospective learning framework for dynamic and sequential decision-making scenarios, such as foraging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of the PAC learning framework, which struggles with dynamic data distributions and changing learner objectives, making it unsuitable for real-world, evolving AI applications.

Method: The authors enhance the prospective learning framework to improve its algorithm and numerical results, extending its application to sequential decision-making scenarios such as foraging.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate improvements to the prospective learning algorithm and its numerical performance while extending its applicability to sequential decision-making.

Conclusion: The study showcases advancements in the prospective learning framework to handle sequential decision-making tasks and evolving conditions, marking progress beyond the traditional PAC learning framework.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

*Qiyang Li,Zhiyuan Zhou,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-chunking is a technique that uses action chunking to improve reinforcement learning (RL) in long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, enhancing both offline and online performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of effective exploration and sample-efficient learning in offline-to-online RL settings, particularly for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.

Method: The Q-chunking method integrates action chunking into temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods, facilitating the use of temporal action sequences for exploration and unbiased n-step backups for more efficient learning.

Result: Experimental results indicate that Q-chunking improves both offline performance and online sample efficiency, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods on a variety of complex manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Q-chunking is a scalable and effective approach for offline-to-online RL in long-horizon tasks, leveraging offline data for improved exploration and learning stability.

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, DeCoLe, to address label bias-related mislabeling in datasets, focusing on hate speech detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of label bias, a persistent issue causing systematic errors in labels across social groups, which impacts data integrity and organizational systems.

Method: They propose Decoupled Confident Learning (DeCoLe), a machine learning-based framework designed to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, backed by theoretical validation and empirical evaluation.

Result: DeCoLe demonstrated superior performance in detecting bias-aware mislabeling compared to alternative approaches, particularly in the context of hate speech detection.

Conclusion: DeCoLe is a powerful tool for enhancing data reliability, enabling organizations to manage label bias effectively and improve data quality in critical domains.

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

*Minchan Jeong,J. Jon Ryu,Se-Young Yun,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable deep learning approach to learn the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator, avoiding unstable operations and improving effectiveness in tasks like eigen-analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing the Koopman operator in dynamical systems rely on computationally unstable linear algebra operations, making them less scalable and biased.

Method: The authors propose a low-rank approximation framework that learns singular functions of the Koopman operator without unstable operations, integrating smoothly into deep learning workflows.

Result: Their approach provides reliable and effective singular subspaces, enhancing applications such as eigen-analysis and multi-step predictions in stochastic systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a simple, scalable, and robust alternative to existing methods for Koopman operator analysis in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

*Maya Kruse,Majid Afshar,Saksham Khatwani,Anoop Mayampurath,Guanhua Chen,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MUSE, a method to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates in large language models by leveraging model diversity and aggregating subsets of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often exhibit inconsistent behavior across inputs, and reliable uncertainty quantification is critical, particularly in high-stakes scenarios. The authors aim to address the gap left by prior work focusing solely on individual models, ignoring the potential benefits of diverse model ensembles.

Method: The authors introduce MUSE, which uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate subsets of large language models. This method is designed to improve calibration and predictive accuracy by leveraging complementary predictions from diverse models.

Result: Through experiments on binary prediction tasks, MUSE demonstrates improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model approaches and naive ensemble baselines.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of using subsets of diverse LLMs for better uncertainty quantification, advocating MUSE as a simple yet effective approach for this purpose.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

*Erfan Hamdi,Emma Lejeune*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a challenging dataset based on phase field modeling (PFM) simulations for benchmarking and advancing machine learning methods in fracture mechanics, while also highlighting the performance of various baseline ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current ML approaches in fracture mechanics, which often rely on simplified benchmarks, by introducing a more realistic and challenging dataset.

Method: The authors created a dataset with 6,000 PFM-based simulations featuring variations in energy decomposition, boundary conditions, and crack configurations, and evaluated baseline ML models (PINN, FNO, and UNet) alongside ensembling strategies.

Result: Baseline evaluations of PINN, FNO, and UNet models showed their capabilities and limitations, while the dataset proved to be a valuable standard for benchmarking ML approaches in solid mechanics.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive benchmark dataset for fracture modeling, offering insights into current ML strengths and weaknesses, and sets the stage for further advancements in this field.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

*Giulio Rossolini,Fabio Brau,Alessandro Biondi,Battista Biggio,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies a security vulnerability in distributed deep learning systems where intermediate features transmitted between edge and cloud components can be exploited to generate adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the overlooked security risks in partitioned deep learning models deployed across Internet of Things environments, emphasizing intermediate feature leakage.

Method: The authors developed an exploitation strategy using intercepted intermediate features, reconstructing tensor shapes via statistical analysis, and fine-tuning surrogate model architectures for feature distillation.

Result: Experimental evaluation reveals that surrogate models leveraging intermediate feature leakage significantly enhance the capabilities of adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: This research highlights the need for secure designs in distributed deep learning systems to mitigate risks from intermediate feature leakage.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

*Chunzhuo Wang,Hans Hallez,Bart Vanrumste*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a robust multimodal framework combining IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection, achieving improved accuracy even under missing data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve dietary monitoring by detecting food intake gestures more accurately, leveraging both wearable IMU sensors and contactless radar sensors.

Method: The authors propose a multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA) to integrate IMU and radar data for gesture detection, ensuring robustness under missing modality conditions.

Result: The framework enhances detection performance with a segmental F1-score improvement of 4.3% (Radar) and 5.2% (IMU). Under missing input conditions, it still shows gains of 1.3% (radar missing) and 2.4% (IMU missing).

Conclusion: This is the first study showing that IMU and radar data fusion through a robust multimodal framework improves gesture detection, and it performs well even when data from one modality is missing.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

*Julianna Piskorz,Krzysztof Kacprzyk,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to model treatment effects as dynamic surfaces over dose and time, improving causal inference beyond static summaries like ATE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static metrics like ATE fail to capture the complex dynamics of treatment effects, particularly in applications like healthcare, where dose and time dependencies are critical.

Method: The study adapts the SemanticODE framework to estimate treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces, emphasizing interpretability, robustness, and clinical relevance.

Result: The proposed method delivers accurate and interpretable models of treatment dynamics, aiding in detailed causal analysis and actionable medical insights.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust mechanism for understanding treatment effects over time and dose, enhancing both scientific rigor and practical decision-making in healthcare domains.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Probabilistic Natural Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), improving sample efficiency in black-box optimisation through Bayesian quadrature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sample efficiency in Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) algorithms used for black-box optimisation, especially important in scenarios like semi-supervised learning.

Method: ProbNES integrates Bayesian quadrature into the NES framework to enhance performance in optimising the objective function over search distributions.

Result: ProbNES outperformed traditional NES, Bayesian Optimisation (BO), and $
\pi$BO in various tasks, including benchmark functions, data-driven tasks, hyperparameter tuning, and locomotion applications.

Conclusion: ProbNES improves upon classic NES by enhancing sample efficiency, making it better suited for a variety of black-box optimisation problems.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of leveraging geometric structures in high-dimensional datasets for tasks like dimensionality estimation, manifold parameterization, and mapping between spaces as per the manifold hypothesis.

Method: The framework uses Mixture of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) combined with Riemannian geometry to estimate intrinsic dimensionality, construct local coordinates, and parameterize manifolds.

Result: The proposed method facilitates accurate manifold parameterization, enhances solutions to inverse problems like biomedical imaging reconstruction, and demonstrates intrinsic dimension as a proxy for model capacity monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates manifold learning and VAEs to tackle dimensionality estimation, efficient inference, and capacity monitoring, showcasing practical value in applications like imaging.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Result: The proposed model displayed significant accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly with multifidelity training, in experiments on PDEs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that discretization independence and multifidelity training reinforce the model's robustness, accuracy, and practical applicability.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Motivation: Address challenges in federated learning, like achieving privacy preservation, efficiency, and optimal performance in non-IID decentralized environments.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework including CNN-PQC architecture, adaptive aggregation using differentially private accuracies, selective homomorphic encryption, and dynamic layer-wise freezing.

Result: Reported up to 25.43% accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN with reduced communication overhead on datasets like CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: AdeptHEQ-FL demonstrates its practicality as a privacy-preserving and resource-efficient solution for advanced federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a clustered federated learning (CFL) design that combines differential privacy and multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize model training among heterogeneous base stations and users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication efficiency and security concerns in federated learning environments with heterogeneous resources and tasks.

Method: A dynamic penalty function-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm for optimizing user scheduling, resource allocation, and privacy noise in CFL.

Result: The proposed DPVD-MARL algorithm improves convergence speed by up to 20% and rewards accumulation by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: The novel CFL design and optimization method enhance performance and scalability for federated learning across distributed base stations.

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

### [216] [Generative Adversarial Evasion and Out-of-Distribution Detection for UAV Cyber-Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21142)
*Deepak Kumar Panda,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) to generate stealthy adversarial attacks on intrusion detection systems (IDS) for UAVs and proposes a detection method using conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to counter these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional anomaly detection methods are ineffective against novel cyber threats targeting UAVs, particularly stealthy adversarial attacks. Enhancing IDS mechanisms to counter these vulnerabilities is crucial.

Method: The authors train a multi-class IDS classifier on telemetry data of UAVs and known attacks, use cGANs to perturb the known attacks to produce stealthy adversarial samples, and employ CVAE with negative log-likelihood scoring to identify these perturbed samples.

Result: CVAE-based regret scores outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial inputs, demonstrating the superiority of probabilistic modeling.

Conclusion: Advanced probabilistic techniques like CVAE can enhance IDS robustness against generative-model-based adaptive cyber threats, bolstering UAV security.

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

*Dongyu Wei,Xiaoren Xu,Yuchen Liu,H. Vincent Poor,Mingzhe Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores deceptive signal-assisted private split learning by using deep reinforcement learning to counter eavesdroppers and optimize energy and delay constraints during collaborative training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance privacy and security during collaborative model training among multiple edge devices, specifically addressing threats posed by eavesdroppers.

Method: It proposes an optimization framework solved using soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning with intrinsic curiosity and cross-attention modules to allocate resources and actions without prior knowledge of eavesdroppers’ positions.

Result: The method improves convergence rates up to 3x and decreases leaked information to eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The introduction of ICM and CA modules in the reinforcement learning framework significantly enhances the efficiency and security of private split learning.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

*Malikussaid,Hilal Hudan Nuha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic approach to adapt generalist large language models into specialized scientific assistants for chemistry, addressing the plausibility-validity gap in their outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but factually invalid information, especially in domains like chemistry, necessitating methods to enhance their reliability.

Method: The paper employed the Magistral Small model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). They developed a dual-domain dataset encompassing molecular properties and chemical reactions for training and evaluation.

Result: The specialized model showed improvements in format adherence, chemical validity, and synthesis feasibility, but issues such as stereochemistry errors, knowledge cutoff, and reference hallucination persisted.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology demonstrates the potential of transforming generalist LLMs into specialized tools for chemical research, while identifying areas needing improvement for future work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

*Ankit Jyothish,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer in graph transformers to improve their accuracy and provide geometric insights for graph representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph transformers often struggle to differentiate heterogeneous topologies, as they embed all nodes in a single Euclidean space. The motivation is to enhance predictive power and interpretability by incorporating geometry-aware projections.

Method: The method involves adding a Riemannian mixture-of-experts layer that routes nodes to different types of manifolds (spherical, flat, hyperbolic) based on their local structure. This is integrated into a state-of-the-art graph transformer ensemble.

Result: The addition of the geometry-aware layer boosts accuracy by up to 3% across four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble ensures that both Euclidean and non-Euclidean features are captured.

Conclusion: Explicit and geometry-aware projections enhance both predictive performance and the interpretability of graph representations in graph transformers.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Context Sample Enhancement (CSE) to improve generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) by leveraging regularities in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policies trained with DRL often fail to generalize to different evaluation environments, and obtaining diverse training data is impractical in many real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose the Context-Enhanced Bellman Equation (CEBE) and derive a data augmentation method, Context Sample Enhancement (CSE), to improve generalization in CMDPs by leveraging transition and reward function regularities.

Result: Analytical and empirical evidence demonstrates that CEBE approximates training across multiple contexts effectively, while simulations show CSE's potential to enhance generalization in deterministic control environments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods, particularly CSE, have significant potential to address generalization challenges in DRL with limited training contexts, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

*Farnam Mansouri,Shai Ben-David*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates PU learning without assuming pre-known class priors, focusing on sample size requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PU learning has significant real-world applications, but traditional approaches often rely on simplifying assumptions, limiting their utility.

Method: The authors analyzed statistical complexity and derived upper and lower bounds for sample sizes required for PU learning under relaxed assumptions.

Result: They found theoretical limits for both positively labeled and unlabeled sample sizes essential for effective learning.

Conclusion: The study broadens the framework for PU learning by removing assumptions about class prior knowledge, offering insights into sample quantity requirements.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATHENA, a hierarchical graph neural network specifically designed to classify subclinical atherosclerosis by integrating clinical and molecular data for personalized diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in current graph-based methods for disease classification, which fail to integrate cohort-wide clinical feature patterns with individual molecular data.

Method: ATHENA combines hierarchical graph neural networks with integrated modality learning to align clinical features and molecular fingerprints effectively, leveraging both patient-specific and cohort-wide insights.

Result: The framework improves classification performance significantly, achieving up to a 13% increase in AUC and a 20% improvement in F1 score compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ATHENA enhances understanding of patient subtypes, enabling explainable AI-driven subnetwork clustering for personalized intervention strategies and effective disease progression prediction.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper addresses weaknesses of reward models in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings and proposes a unified framework to enhance robustness and scoring, showing superior performance in experimental evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often fail in OOD settings, exposing vulnerabilities in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). The motivation is to build a robust framework that mitigates reward hacking and improves reliability.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework combining Bradley-Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions within a shared embedding space to tackle OOD challenges.

Result: Their approach empirically improves robustness and scoring, enabling a 7B model to outperform a 70B baseline and demonstrating mitigation of reward hacking in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The unified framework offers complementary benefits, enhancing both single-objective and multi-objective reward functions, effectively addressing weaknesses in RLHF under OOD settings.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding internal ice layers is crucial for monitoring snow and ice dynamics and reducing uncertainties in climate models.

Method: GRIT integrates geometric graph learning with attention mechanisms, mapping relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. It combines transformers for long-range dependency learning with graph neural networks for spatial patterns.

Result: GRIT showed consistently lower prediction errors compared to baseline graph neural networks.

Conclusion: GRIT's novel approach demonstrates effectiveness in capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics of ice layers.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal
ice layers in Radar imagery is essential in monitoring the snow accumulation,
better evaluating ice dynamics processes, and minimizing uncertainties in
climate models. Radar sensors, capable of penetrating ice, capture detailed
radargram images of internal ice layers. In this work, we introduce GRIT, graph
transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer, which outperforms existing methods for analyzing ice layer thickness in radar imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to monitor snow accumulation and assess ice dynamics to reduce uncertainties in climate models through advanced analysis of radar images showing ice layer thickness and variability.

Method: The method involves ST-GRIT, which utilizes an inductive geometric graph learning framework to capture spatial features as embeddings, paired with temporal and spatial attention blocks to model long-range dependencies in radargram data.

Result: ST-GRIT achieves lower root mean-squared error compared to current state-of-the-art approaches and other baseline graph neural networks when tested on Greenland ice sheet radargram data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that self-attention mechanisms combined with distinct spatial and temporal attention blocks are effective in handling noise, avoiding oversmoothing, and capturing long-range dependencies for robust ice layer analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

*Seonghyun Park,Kiyoung Seong,Soojung Yang,Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents TLC, a framework for discovering collective variables (CVs) based on time-lagged conditions to enhance dynamic sampling simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare molecular events are challenging to study using conventional simulations due to their slow dynamics. Enhanced sampling techniques need CVs to capture these slow degrees of freedom. Many automated CV methods focus on state discrimination but lack accurate representation of detailed dynamics.

Method: TLC is a generative modeling approach that utilizes time-lagged conditional distributions to identify CVs that encode dynamic behavior rather than static distributions. The framework was tested on enhanced sampling tasks using the Alanine Dipeptide system.

Result: TLC demonstrated comparable or improved performance over existing machine learning methods for CV discovery in sampling rare state transitions and discriminating meta-stable states.

Conclusion: TLC provides an innovative and efficient way to capture dynamic behaviors for molecular simulations through time-lagged collective variables.

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTED, a novel metric framework for evaluating statement autoformalization, addressing shortcomings in existing methods by focusing on semantic understanding and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating statement autoformalization struggle with semantic comprehension, computational inefficiencies, and depend heavily on current levels of theorem proving progress.

Method: GTED creates operator trees by standardizing formal statements and calculates semantic similarity using the Generalized Tree Edit Distance metric.

Result: GTED achieved superior accuracy and Kappa scores compared to baseline metrics on miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTED offers a more reliable and effective metric for evaluating statement autoformalization, contributing significantly to automated evaluation practices in the field.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental

TL;DR: This paper introduces HGMP, a framework for heterogeneous graphs that unifies downstream tasks, integrates contrastive pre-training, and uses feature prompts, outperforming baselines on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-training methods for heterogeneous graph neural networks suffer from mismatches between pre-trained models and downstream tasks, resulting in performance issues. This paper aims to address these challenges with a new multi-task framework.

Method: The paper reformulates downstream tasks into a unified format, incorporates a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy specific to heterogeneous graphs, and introduces heterogeneous feature prompts to enhance input representations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that HGMP adapts well across various tasks and achieves substantial performance improvements over existing baseline models.

Conclusion: HGMP effectively narrows the gap between pre-trained models and downstream tasks while outperforming existing methods, making it a robust tool for heterogeneous graph-related tasks.

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: Deep neural networks naturally infer beliefs about generative models of data and exhibit geometric relationships in activations independent of architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the intrinsic capabilities of deep neural networks to represent probabilistic models and perform Bayesian updates during inference.

Method: Analyzes how neural network activations geometrically represent latent probabilistic models, comparing architectural independence and evaluating iterative updates.

Result: Neural networks discover geometric relationships in activations linked to past input sequences, correlating with predictive probability density dynamics.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks inherently engage in Bayesian-like inference, showcasing architecture-independent representation of probabilistic generative world models.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical sciences face challenges in leveraging conventional machine learning due to diverse, small, and fuzzy datasets, necessitating alternative approaches.

Method: The paper reviews fundamental principles of general-purpose models and provides examples of their applications in chemical sciences.

Result: GPMs demonstrate the ability to solve tasks beyond their direct training, excel with small datasets, and show potential across various scientific processes.

Conclusion: Though many applications are preliminary, GPMs are anticipated to advance significantly with growing interest and development.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called DTME-MTL for improving Multi-Task Learning in transformer-based models by working in token space to address gradient conflicts and avoid inefficiencies involved in duplicating network parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Task Learning often suffers from negative transfer due to differences in task objectives, and transformer-based architectures have limitations in adaptability and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose DTME-MTL, which identifies gradient conflicts in token space and applies adaptive solutions to mitigate negative transfer while reducing overfitting, without duplicating network parameters.

Result: Experiments show that DTME-MTL consistently enhances multi-task performance across different tasks while keeping computational overhead minimal.

Conclusion: DTME-MTL provides a scalable and effective way to improve transformer-based MTL frameworks by addressing gradient conflicts directly in token space, leading to better task performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

### [232] [Uncertainty Quantification for Motor Imagery BCI -- Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07511)
*Joris Suurmeijer,Ivo Pascal de Jong,Matias Valdenegro-Toro,Andreea Ioana Sburlea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares uncertainty quantification across different classifiers for Motor Imagery brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), showing that CSP-LDA and MDRM-T offer the best uncertainty estimates while Deep Learning models provide better classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research on uncertainty quantification in Motor Imagery BCIs, which aims to improve the reliability of machine learning classifiers in predicting brain signal outputs.

Method: Compared established BCI classifiers (CSP-LDA and MDRM) with specialized Deep Learning methods (Deep Ensembles, Direct Uncertainty Quantification, and CNNs) regarding accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: CSP-LDA and MDRM-T provide better uncertainty estimates, while Deep Learning methods – specifically Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs – achieve the highest classification accuracy.

Conclusion: By leveraging models with strong uncertainty quantification, difficult samples can be flagged or rejected, enhancing the accuracy of Motor Imagery BCIs.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

*Berkant Turan,Suhrab Asadulla,David Steinmann,Wolfgang Stammer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a framework combining Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) and Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for nonlinear classification of high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in translating complex, high-dimensional inputs into interpretable models by combining the strengths of PVGs and CBMs.

Method: NCV extracts structured concept encodings from raw inputs using minimally supervised models. A prover selects relevant encodings, which are then used exclusively by a nonlinear verifier for decision-making.

Result: NCV outperformed CBM and pixel-based PVG baselines on challenging datasets while alleviating shortcut behavior.

Conclusion: NCV represents a significant step forward for interpretable and verifiable AI in nonlinear and high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

### [234] [Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559)
*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD introduces a novel real-time decorrelation-based model for detecting anomalies in multivariate time series, achieving robust and efficient single-pass anomaly detection with minimal memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for real-time anomaly detection arises due to the proliferation of high-dimensional streaming data in applications such as IoT, requiring methods that ensure fast and memory-efficient decision-making.

Method: DAD employs an online decorrelation learning approach to dynamically monitor data correlations sample-by-sample, avoiding reliance on historical data for anomaly detection.

Result: Experiments on widely used benchmark datasets reveal that DAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in consistent efficacy across diverse anomaly types and robustness to increasing data dimensionality.

Conclusion: DAD establishes a new benchmark for memory-constrained, real-time anomaly detection by delivering a balance of computational efficiency and detection effectiveness.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

*Uliana Parkina,Maxim Rakhuba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an inversion-free, regularized framework for context-aware low-rank approximations in neural networks, addressing numerical instabilities in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome numerical instabilities and limitations in current context-aware low-rank approximation methods for neural network compression and fine-tuning.

Method: A novel inversion-free framework based on stable decomposition, designed to handle GPU memory constraints, near-singular activation matrices, and insufficient data scenarios.

Result: The proposed method ensures stable approximations even under challenging settings and provides explicit error bounds for cases with insufficient data.

Conclusion: The authors' framework resolves numerical instability issues and enhances the reliability of low-rank approximations for neural networks in various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on optimizing conditional handovers (CHOs) in modern cellular networks using a meta-learning approach, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of prolonged delays and increased failures in traditional handovers, particularly in complex mobile networks with diverse users and smaller cells.

Method: The authors propose a novel CHO optimization framework aligned with the O-RAN paradigm, leveraging meta-learning for enhanced robustness and performance.

Result: The framework provides robust dynamic regret guarantees and outperforms 3GPP benchmarks by at least 180% in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learning framework is highly effective in optimizing CHOs, addressing resource allocation and signaling overhead issues while significantly improving handover performance.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

*Iago Xabier Vázquez García,Damla Partanaz,Emrullah Fatih Yetkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimized clustering mechanism for O*NET occupation definitions using BERT-based techniques and analyzes dimensionality reduction effects on clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of varying occupational definitions across firms and countries, making it essential to map differing occupation definitions for expanded use of O*NET.

Method: A clustering pipeline was developed using BERT-based techniques, various clustering approaches, and dimensionality reduction methods, with performance enhancements using a specialized silhouette method.

Result: The new clustering-based mapping achieves improved distinction of occupations, enabling more seamless identification and comparison.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates better occupational differentiation for applications like career changes, offering an automated tool to map and expand occupational data from O*NET.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

*Sebastian Lotter,Elisabeth Mohr,Andrina Rutsch,Lukas Brand,Francesca Ronchi,Laura Díaz-Marugán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using personal health data and machine learning to improve treatments based on modulating the gut-brain axis (GBA) for neurological diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are limitations in current treatments for neurological diseases using gut-brain axis (GBA) modulation, as they are heuristic and fail to help certain patients. The goal is to use synthetic molecular communication and personalized health data to improve these treatments.

Method: The authors define theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation, design a machine learning model to verify these requirements, and evaluate the model's performance across datasets to identify relevant GBA modulatory pathways.

Result: The machine learning model demonstrated excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA, and specific therapeutic pathways were successfully identified.

Conclusion: Leveraging personal health data and machine learning can significantly enhance the development of more effective and personalized treatments for neurological diseases through GBA modulation.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: SParSeFuL demonstrates a significant reduction in energy and bandwidth consumption, making resource-constrained IoT devices more viable participants in sustainability efforts.

Conclusion: SParSeFuL bridges the gap between Federated Learning and environmental sustainability, empowering Society 5.0 to balance technological advancements with ecological responsibility.

Abstract: Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence but
struggles to meet the sustainability demands of emerging IoT ecosystems
necessary for Society 5.0-a human-centered technological future balancing
social advancement with environmental responsibility. The excessive
communication bandwidth and computational resources required by traditional FL
approaches make them environmentally unsustainable at scale, creating a
fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of

TL;DR: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation struggles with causal-spurious entanglement and alignment issues. SLOGAN resolves these with sparse causal modeling and generative intervention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph domain adaptation by addressing causal-spurious feature entanglement and global alignment failures.

Method: SLOGAN employs sparse causal graphs, mutual information bottleneck constraints, generative intervention, and adaptive category calibration.

Result: Experiments show SLOGAN significantly surpasses baseline methods across several real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SLOGAN is effective in stable graph representation transfer by disentangling causal features and addressing spurious correlations, offering improved unsupervised graph domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid model combining Convolutions and Transformers for better Parkinson's Disease detection using EEG, achieving superior accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite EEG being an affordable and noninvasive diagnostic tool for Parkinson's Disease, current deep learning models face challenges with poor generalizability due to high inter-subject variability. This necessitates new architectures tailored for EEG data.

Method: The proposed model, TransformEEG, uses a depthwise convolutional tokenizer to generate channel-specific features, improving feature mixing within Transformer layers. Four datasets with 290 subjects were harmonized, and performance was benchmarked via Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation against seven EEG deep learning models.

Result: TransformEEG achieved a median balanced accuracy of 78.45% and the lowest variability (6.37% interquartile range) under cross-validation. With data augmentation and threshold correction, accuracy improved to 80.10%.

Conclusion: TransformEEG reduces variability and enhances reliability in Parkinson's Disease detection with EEG data compared to existing models, highlighting its value in clinical applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decentralized Federated Split Learning framework for privacy-sensitive machine learning, implemented on Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring data privacy with high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in collaborative machine learning, such as privacy risks in Federated Learning and scalability issues in Split Learning, particularly in sensitive enterprise settings.

Method: The paper combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with Hyperledger Fabric blockchain's decentralized features, leveraging transient fields and Private Data Collections to ensure privacy and scalability without a central coordinator.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed HLF-FSL framework achieves comparable accuracy to centralized FSL while improving training efficiency and maintaining minimal blockchain overhead.

Conclusion: The HLF-FSL framework is a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for enterprise machine learning, demonstrating enterprise-grade viability with strong performance and accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a mathematical analysis of the layerwise effective dimension in fully-connected ReLU networks, identifying geometric and oscillatory behaviors in rank deficits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the layerwise effective dimension impacts the expressivity and behavior of deep ReLU networks, particularly under finite width.

Method: Derived closed-form expressions for expected ranks using Gaussian weights and mathematical proofs for concentration bounds and revival depths.

Result: The rank deficit in ReLU networks decays geometrically with a specific ratio, and the rank exhibits oscillatory behavior at certain depths in finite-width architectures.

Conclusion: Random ReLU layers exhibit alternating patterns of collapse and partial revival in rank due to finite-width phenomena, enriching the understanding of deep network functionality.

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedCBDR, a Federated Class Incremental Learning method addressing class imbalance in data replay for collaborative learning, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of class imbalance and forgetting in Federated Class Incremental Learning by enhancing data replay mechanisms for improved long-term learning performance.

Method: Proposed FedCBDR, which includes a global-perspective data replay module for balanced sampling and a task-aware temperature scaling module to adjust the temperature of logits for mitigating overconfidence and improving sensitivity.

Result: FedCBDR demonstrated balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data, improved generalization across tasks, and a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedCBDR effectively addresses class imbalance issues in FCIL, resulting in improved collaborative learning performance and robustness under diverse task distributions.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol to identify vulnerabilities in Large Language Models through dynamic refinement of jailbreak prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively evaluating vulnerabilities caused by jailbreak attacks in rapidly evolving LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes GuardVal, which dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM’s state, alongside a new optimization method to improve prompt refinement.

Result: GuardVal was applied to models including Mistral-7b and GPT-4 across 10 safety domains, revealing distinct behavioral patterns and robustness levels among different models.

Conclusion: GuardVal enhances our understanding of LLM weaknesses and robustness, offering insights for developing more secure future models.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a

### [246] [Efficient and Scalable Estimation of Distributional Treatment Effects with Multi-Task Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07738)
*Tomu Hirata,Undral Byambadalai,Tatsushi Oka,Shota Yasui,Shingo Uto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multi-task neural network approach to accurately estimate distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments, addressing challenges in precision and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods focusing on Average Treatment Effect (ATE) fail to provide granular insights into treatment outcomes. Estimating DTE, while more informative, presents challenges in precision and computational inefficiencies, especially for large datasets.

Method: The authors use multi-task neural networks with monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning for estimating conditional outcome distributions, addressing data imbalance and inefficiency issues.

Result: Experimental results using both simulated and real data, including trials on reducing water consumption in the US and a streaming platform in Japan, demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances accuracy, robustness, and practicality in estimating DTE, making it a valuable tool for modern causal inference applications requiring detailed treatment effect analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

### [247] [OPC: One-Point-Contraction Unlearning Toward Deep Feature Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07754)
*Jaeheun Jung,Bosung Jung,Suhyun Bae,Donghun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel unlearning algorithm, OPC, addressing vulnerabilities in shallow forgetting shown by existing methods and achieving robust deep forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, legal, or ethical requirements effectively by ensuring robust unlearning in machine learning models.

Method: The paper defines a theoretical criterion for deep forgetting, introduces an efficient approximation algorithm, and proposes the One-Point-Contraction (OPC) unlearning algorithm.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate OPC's unlearning effectiveness and its resilience against performance recovery and data reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: OPC enforces robust deep forgetting through theoretical foundations, highlighting the need for better resilience in machine unlearning methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

### [248] [TRIX- Trading Adversarial Fairness via Mixed Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07768)
*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX is a novel adversarial training framework designed to address class vulnerabilities and improve robustness fairness across different classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial training methods traditionally apply a uniform defense mechanism across all classes, which often leads to robustness disparities because not all classes are equally susceptible to adversarial attacks.

Method: TRIX employs adaptive adversarial training where strong classes receive weaker targeted adversaries to improve feature diversity and weak classes receive stronger untargeted adversaries for enhanced robustness, along with loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments.

Result: In experiments on image classification benchmarks, TRIX demonstrated enhanced worst-case accuracy for both clean and adversarial data while reducing inter-class robustness disparities.

Conclusion: TRIX provides a balanced adversarial training approach that improves fairness in robustness across all classes without compromising overall accuracy, making it a practical defense mechanism.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

*Ruohong Liu,Jack Umenberger,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the scalability challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) for building energy management across diverse operational contexts and introduces a framework for generalizable policy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in RL-based solutions for building energy management have shown promise, but scalability issues due to varied dynamics and objectives highlight the need for improved generalization methods.

Method: The authors define a multi-objective contextual RL formulation that includes parameterizing contextual information. They also create a benchmark environment to evaluate RL methods for cross-context adaptability.

Result: Results reveal that while existing multi-objective RL approaches achieve reasonable trade-offs between competing goals, their performance diminishes under certain dynamic variations.

Conclusion: Incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into RL policy design is critical for achieving robustness and generalization in building energy management applications.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

*Wooseong Jeong,Jegyeong Cho,Youngho Yoon,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of domain adaptation in multi-task scenarios and proposes a novel test-time training approach, S4T, to synchronize tasks. Their method outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle to generalize to unseen domains under distribution shifts, especially in multi-task settings where optimal adaptation varies across tasks.

Method: The proposed S4T method predicts task relations across domain shifts to synchronize tasks during test-time training, ensuring effective multi-task handling.

Result: S4T demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art TTT methods on standard multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: Synchronizing tasks using task relations improves the effectiveness of test-time training for multi-task scenarios and offers a promising solution to domain generalization.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

### [251] [Space-Filling Regularization for Robust and Interpretable Nonlinear State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07792)
*Hermann Klein,Max Heinz Herkersdorf,Oliver Nelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in state space representation training for nonlinear systems by introducing space-filling regularization for better data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State space dynamics representation often leads to deformed state trajectories during training, which negatively impacts interpretability, robustness, and training effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose two regularization techniques using data-distribution-based penalties, applied within local model network architectures.

Result: Implementation of the regularization methods in local affine state space models improves data distribution and addresses challenges in system identification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Space-filling regularization enhances state space modeling by improving data coverage, interpretability, and robustness of local model networks.

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

*Alba Garrido,Alejandro Almodóvar,Patricia A. Apellániz,Juan Parras,Santiago Zazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMVAE, a multimodal deep learning framework for survival prediction in oncology, utilizing clinical, molecular, and histopathological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival prediction models are limited by reliance on single data modalities, failing to capture tumor complexity.

Method: SAMVAE integrates six data modalities via modality-specific encoders into a shared latent space, employing deep learning with parametric formulation.

Result: Evaluation on breast cancer and glioma datasets shows strong performance in standard survival analysis and competing risks scenarios.

Conclusion: SAMVAE provides a competitive, interpretable, and multimodal solution for survival analysis, contributing meaningful insights to clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new, refined Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks in transformers by analyzing the spectral norm of the softmax function, along with a novel regularization term JaSMin to enhance robustness and control Lipschitz constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness and accuracy of transformers by understanding and controlling their Lipschitz constants through deeper analysis of self-attention mechanisms and softmax spectral norms.

Method: The authors derive a more precise closed-form expression for softmax spectral norms to obtain a refined Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks. They also propose a lightweight regularization term, JaSMin, focused on minimizing Jacobian softmax norms.

Result: The study demonstrates how attention score distributions impact robustness, providing a better explanation of this relationship. The proposed JaSMin regularization term enhances the robustness of transformer models and decreases their local Lipschitz constants.

Conclusion: The novel Lipschitz bound and JaSMin regularization improve the robustness of transformers by carefully analyzing attention mechanisms and introducing techniques to regulate spectral norms effectively.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating free-text features into tabular data pipelines and proposes ablation strategies. It benchmarks foundation models using curated datasets with textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual columns, despite the increasing interest in extending models to handle more modalities.

Method: Develop ablation-style strategies to incorporate text into tabular pipelines and benchmark state-of-the-art models using curated datasets with meaningful text features.

Result: A curated collection of real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich text features improves benchmarks for foundation models.

Conclusion: This study advances the evaluation of foundation models for tabular data handling textual features, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse data modalities in benchmarks.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

*Giovanni Dispoto,Paolo Bonetti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel algorithm that extracts interpretable linear policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) without sacrificing information about expert behavior, focusing on the advantage function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability in DRL models, which often forces practitioners to prefer simpler algorithms in mission-critical applications despite performance trade-offs.

Method: The paper proposes an algorithm that utilizes the advantage function to capture why certain actions are superior. It allows training interpretable policies using pre-collected experience, ensuring the preservation of expert behavioral nuances.

Result: The algorithm was tested in classic control environments and a financial trading scenario, showing its ability to extract meaningful insights from complex expert policies.

Conclusion: An effective, interpretable policy extraction method for DRL was developed, offering both theoretical guarantees and empirical proof of meaningfulness in extracting expert behavior while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the theoretical convergence of natural-gradient variational inference as current guarantees are difficult to establish, even for simple cases with Gaussian approximations and concave log-likelihoods.

Method: The paper proposes using a square-root parameterization for the Gaussian covariance to simplify convergence analysis and employs continuous-time gradient flow to further study natural-gradient methods.

Result: The proposed method provides novel theoretical convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and demonstrates the superiority of natural gradient methods over Euclidean and Wasserstein geometries in experiments.

Conclusion: The study confirms that the square-root parameterization is effective for ensuring the convergence of natural-gradient variational inference and underscores the practical advantages of natural-gradient methods.

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Motivation: To address the challenge SMEs face in credit risk analysis due to scarce data, particularly for online lenders without direct credit records.

Method: The study uses a GNN-based model to analyze SME interactions through transaction and social datasets to map spatial connections and assess loan default risks.

Result: The GNN outperformed traditional models, achieving AUC scores of 0.995 for supply chain mining and 0.701 for default prediction, validated on large datasets from Discover and Ant Credit.

Conclusion: The GNN framework is a scalable and effective approach for SME credit risk assessment, benefiting lenders, regulators, and stress testers in determining financial risks.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of direct preference optimization (DPO), connecting major ML theories on learning from preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a principled understanding of DPO due to its widespread applications and current popularity, while avoiding pitfalls and exploring its potential extensions.

Method: The authors connect Savage's losses from ML with stochastic choice theories, expanding DPO to include abstentions, non-convex objectives, and extensions like margins and corrections.

Result: The framework provides generalized insights into DPO and its extensions, clarifying its limitations and opportunities.

Conclusion: The analysis broadens the theoretical map of DPO, offering a robust foundation for its various applications and future improvements.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antimicrobial resistance is becoming a critical problem; ApexOracle, an AI model, predicts and designs new antibiotics against unknown pathogens, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the slow pace of antibiotic development necessitate innovative methods to combat emerging drug-resistant pathogens.

Method: ApexOracle combines molecular features with pathogen-specific genomic- and literature-derived strain representations, utilizing AI techniques like discrete diffusion language models and dual-embedding frameworks.

Result: The model outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in predicting antibacterial activity across diverse bacteria, transferred successfully to novel pathogens, and generated new molecules with high efficacy.

Conclusion: ApexOracle provides a scalable and effective AI-based strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance by pairing fast activity prediction with the creation of novel antibiotics.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Motivation: Enhance the performance of machine learning scoring functions for binding affinity prediction through synthetic data augmentation generated by co-folding models.

Method: Evaluated co-folding models' ability to provide high-quality augmented data and developed heuristics to identify reliable co-folding predictions when experimental structures are unavailable.

Result: Performance improvements were observed when high-quality synthetic data was used, and simple heuristics were successful in identifying such augmented data.

Conclusion: Co-folding model-based synthetic data augmentation is feasible and can substitute experimental data, provided that high-quality predictions are identified effectively, informing future augmentation strategies.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data
augmentation in training machine learning-based scoring functions (MLSFs) for
binding affinity prediction. Our results show that performance gains depend
critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding

*Hao Ban,Gokul Ram Subramani,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses task conflicts in multi-task learning using a novel optimization approach called SAMO that integrates Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve task conflicts arising in multi-task learning, which impact performance due to gradients varying in direction or magnitude.

Method: The authors propose SAMO, combining global and local gradient information with joint global-local perturbations. SAMO approximates local perturbations using forward passes and normalizes these perturbations layerwise for efficiency.

Result: Empirical results show SAMO effectively mitigates task conflicts, showcasing improved performance and efficiency on multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMO provides a lightweight, practical solution to both computational inefficiencies and task conflicts in multi-task learning, demonstrating significant promise.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Motivation: Existing pruning methods are limited by their focus on structured sparsity and reliance on retraining or specialized hardware, which underutilizes the potential for finer efficiency gains on low-power devices without SIMD or parallel compute.

Method: UnIT dynamically identifies and skips unnecessary computations during inference using input-specific activation patterns. It leverages lightweight comparisons instead of multiplications and employs optimized, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored for embedded platforms.

Result: On the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT reduces MAC operations by 11.02% to 82.03%, improves inference speed by 27.30% to 84.19%, and lowers energy consumption by 27.33% to 84.38%, all while maintaining accuracy within 0.48% to 7%. It also excels under domain shifts compared to retrained models.

Conclusion: UnIT proves to be an effective method for efficient deployment of deep neural networks on low-power microcontrollers, eliminating the need for retraining and taking full advantage of irregular sparsity.

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced approach using a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system to track emerging financial topics in companies' earnings calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling techniques fail to dynamically capture evolving industries and emerging topics during financial analysis.

Method: The authors propose an LLM-agent that extracts, structures, and organizes topics from earnings calls into a hierarchical ontology, linking new topics with existing ones.

Result: The method successfully identifies emerging trends and generates company-level insights. Its performance is evaluated based on ontology coherence, topic evolution accuracy, and its ability to detect financial trends.

Conclusion: The LLM-agent approach effectively captures and structures emerging financial topics, offering a modern and accurate solution for financial analysis in a dynamic industrial landscape.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

### [266] [Low Resource Reconstruction Attacks Through Benign Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07947)
*Sol Yarkoni,Roi Livni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper devises a low-resource attack to reconstruct training images using benign prompts, highlighting privacy risks in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models like diffusion models pose privacy and copyright risks, and there is a need to understand these risks through practical attacks and experiments.

Method: The authors propose an attack that uses benign prompts to reconstruct images from trained generative models, leveraging domain knowledge tied to templated e-commerce data layouts.

Result: They demonstrate that seemingly harmless prompts, like 'blue Unisex T-Shirt,' can unintentionally generate identifiable human models from the training data of existing models.

Conclusion: Even uninformed users pose risks of unintentionally reconstructing training set images, emphasizing the need for stricter data governance in generative models.

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

### [267] [Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955)
*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the H-Net model, which operates at the byte level without tokenization, enabling true end-to-end language model training and achieving superior performance over token-based models, especially in domains with weak tokenization heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop language models that eliminate the limitations of tokenization to achieve true end-to-end learning from raw data.

Method: Introduce dynamic chunking mechanisms alongside hierarchical network (H-Net) architectures that jointly learn content- and context-dependent segmentation strategies without tokenization.

Result: H-Net outperforms token-based Transformer models, excels in character-level robustness, and achieves significant gains in data efficiency, especially in less-structured domains such as DNA sequences and Chinese text.

Conclusion: H-Net demonstrates the potential for scalable, fully end-to-end models that learn directly from unprocessed data and outperform tokenized alternatives across diverse modalities.

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

### [268] [EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986)
*Perry Dong,Qiyang Li,Dorsa Sadigh,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new RL algorithm, EXPO, which aims to train expressive policies more efficiently by combining stable imitation learning with a lightweight edit policy to maximize value, resulting in superior sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training expressive policy classes, such as diffusion and flow-matching policies, with online RL is challenging due to unstable value maximization caused by design characteristics like long denoising chains.

Method: The authors propose EXPO, which employs a dual-policy system: a base expressive policy trained via imitation learning and a Gaussian edit policy that adjusts actions for higher value. An on-the-fly RL policy selects actions for sampling and TD backup.

Result: EXPO showed significant improvements in sample efficiency: achieving 2-3x better performance over prior methods in both fine-tuning pretrained policies and using offline data for online training.

Conclusion: The EXPO algorithm effectively addresses the stable value maximization problem by combining expressive policies with an efficient edit mechanism, and enhances RL performance in sample-constrained environments.

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

### [269] [Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996)
*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how pretrained neural networks can adapt their architectures dynamically using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methodology to construct efficient and effective 'chain-of-layers' (CoLa) configurations for individual test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observation that static pretrained model architectures may not be optimal for all input types, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance when dealing with simpler or more complex tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a method to manipulate layers of large language models (LLMs) as independent modules. Layers can be skipped, repeated, or reordered to form customized architectures (CoLa) for individual test samples, guided by a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Result: The proposed CoLa approach demonstrates over 75% inference efficiency improvements for samples with correct predictions and corrects errors in predictions for over 60% of previously misclassified cases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of fixed architectures in pretrained LLMs for diverse inputs and showcases the potential of test-time dynamic depth adaptation to optimize both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

### [270] [A Robust, Open-Source Framework for Spiking Neural Networks on Low-End FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07284)
*Andrew Fan,Simon D. Levy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient SNN acceleration framework targeting low-end FPGAs, achieving competitive speed and accuracy on tasks like MNIST digit recognition, while using minimal hardware resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing computational demand of traditional neural networks has driven exploration into spiking neural networks (SNNs) due to their efficiency. However, most existing neuromorphic chips are inaccessible and FPGA-based solutions either require expensive FPGAs or focus on specific SNN topologies.

Method: The authors developed an SNN acceleration architecture for low-end FPGAs with minimal resource requirements, coupled with a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. The design includes a synaptic array to propagate spikes across the SNN.

Result: The proposed system was tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and achieved competitive performance in MNIST digit recognition (0.52 ms/image) and accurate simulation of any-to-any spiking neural networks on toy problems.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that low-end FPGAs can provide an accessible and efficient platform for SNN acceleration, making neuromorphic computing more widely available. The open-sourced framework allows further exploration and development by the community.

Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased
significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential
solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1
spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate
operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for
more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating
and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and
SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider
community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve
as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many
proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN
topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN
acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting
any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a
synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture
targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.
The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves
competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further
experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking
neural networks on toy problems. All code and setup instructions are available

*Yi-Chun Hung,Gregory Schwartz,Emily A. Cooper,Emma Alexander*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework to accurately model energy-efficient and noise-resilient neuronal population coding under metabolic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to accurately describe neural population dynamics under metabolic resource limits and noise, necessitating new approaches to understand energy-efficient neural adaptation.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework incorporating two constraints: firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. The model connects ATP use and noise through an energy-dependent Poisson noise framework.

Result: The framework predicts an optimal decay path for energy-budgeted neuronal spike activity, linking electrophysiological parameters like resting potential and leak conductance to coding strategies. It also aligns with experimental observations of tuning curve adaptation under energy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding neuron behavior under energy and noise constraints, generalizing population coding models and capturing dynamic adaptations empirically observed.

Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by
metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not
accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example,
shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which
they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This
adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in
response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding
framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple
constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit
tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our
contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework
that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our
simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on
the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the
least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each
state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential
and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments
and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We
analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying
energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how
populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been
observed empirically.

TL;DR: The paper discusses propositional program equivalence, which abstracts away statement semantics to turn an undecidable problem into a decidable scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate a way to make program equivalence decidable by abstracting statement semantics.

Method: The study uses the perspective of Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKA or GKAT) to analyze propositional program equivalence.

Result: Propositional equivalence, where logical structures like 'if' statements are examinable without considering semantics, becomes feasible and decidable.

Conclusion: Using GKA/GKAT provides significant advancements in understanding and achieving propositional program equivalence.

Abstract: General program equivalence is undecidable. However, if we abstract away the
semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but
practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else
$f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what
$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional
equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in
propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene
Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cartographer relies on optimization to refine pose estimates and enhance map accuracy, prompting an evaluation of g2o and Ceres solvers to identify the more effective option.

Method: The paper conducted comparative experiments of g2o and Ceres solvers within the Cartographer framework using real-world mapping scenarios involving the AgileX LIMO robot.

Result: Ceres demonstrated faster convergence, required fewer iterations, and improved map quality, while g2o was found to excel in obstacle detection in localized scenarios.

Conclusion: Ceres is superior for overall SLAM optimization in Cartographer, but g2o has niche advantages in localized detection tasks.

Abstract: This article presents a comparative analysis of g2o and Ceres solvers in
enhancing scan matching performance within the Cartographer framework.
Cartographer, a widely-used library for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), relies on optimization algorithms to refine pose estimates and improve
map accuracy. The research aims to evaluate the performance, efficiency, and
accuracy of the g2o solver in comparison to the Ceres solver, which is the
default in Cartographer. In our experiments comparing Ceres and g2o within
Cartographer, Ceres outperformed g2o in terms of speed, convergence efficiency,
and overall map clarity. Ceres required fewer iterations and less time to
converge, producing more accurate and well-defined maps, especially in
real-world mapping scenarios with the AgileX LIMO robot. However, g2o excelled
in localized obstacle detection, highlighting its value in specific situations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a soft robotic dressing system (SWAG) that offers safer and more efficient dressing assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing rigid robotic dressing solutions such as difficulty handling deformable garments, excessive operation time, and constrained user adaptability.

Method: The authors propose the Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which utilizes an unfurling and growth mechanism for deployment to minimize skin-garment friction.

Result: SWAG effectively demonstrated garment application in various configurations, overcoming prior challenges faced by rigid robotic systems.

Conclusion: The SWAG system offers a promising and adaptive alternative for robotic dressing assistance, enhancing efficiency and safety.

Abstract: Robotic dressing assistance has the potential to improve the quality of life
for individuals with limited mobility. Existing solutions predominantly rely on
rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable
garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior
robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control
strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and
adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the
Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth
mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the
SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method,
eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient
dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its
design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.
The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various

TL;DR: The paper introduces a steerable vine robot designed to navigate confined environments like pipes and burrows. It features external tip steering for 3D maneuverability, branch selection, and real-time localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robots struggle to navigate confined spaces with branches and sharp turns due to limitations in adaptability and maneuverability.

Method: The vine robot employs a tubular body, an external tip mount for 3D steering by altering growth direction, and wall bracing, alongside sensors for localization.

Result: The robot achieves a maximum steerable angle of 51.7°, navigation in pipe networks with radii as small as 2.5 cm, compliant maneuverability in sharp turns, and real-time localization in GPS-denied areas.

Conclusion: The steerable vine robot offers enhanced capabilities for precise navigation and inspection in confined and complex environments such as pipes and burrows.

Abstract: Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and
pipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in
maneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are
soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material
eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate
tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing
vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways,
with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine
robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot
features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine
robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when
necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip
steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a
maximum steerable angle of 51.7{\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with
radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp
turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using
tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward
kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe
system as well as a natural animal burrow.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LangNav, a dataset for evaluating language-focused navigation and proposes a method, MLFM, which outperforms navigation baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap of lacking a language-focused benchmark to test how well embodied agents can ground linguistic instructions during navigation tasks.

Method: The authors developed LangNav, a dataset with manually verified object descriptions, and LangNavBench, a benchmark for evaluating semantic navigation. Additionally, they proposed the MLFM method to create a queryable multi-layered semantic map.

Result: LangNav and LangNavBench allow better systematic comparison of semantic-navigation methods, focusing on language understanding. MLFM demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in the LangNav dataset.

Conclusion: LangNav and LangNavBench establish themselves as crucial tools for language-directed navigation evaluation, while the MLFM method shows efficacy in handling complex instructions.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of consensus on the definitions of 'swarm' and 'emergence,' which creates confusion among researchers and impedes scientific progress in these areas.

Method: The authors propose a framework that differentiates externally observable states from latent, unobservable ones, enabling systematic comparison of existing definitions.

Result: The analysis highlights the subjective nature of these concepts, emphasizing the influence of perception and tacit knowledge of observers rather than inherent system properties.

Conclusion: The paper argues that defining 'swarm' depends on the process behind group behavior and advocates using the proposed framework to guide the development of true robotic swarm systems.

Abstract: Emergence and swarms are widely discussed topics, yet no consensus exists on
their formal definitions. This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only
for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use
the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to
objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the
role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an
observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the
terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we
propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally
observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and
contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We
argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system
itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer.
Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior
alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to
support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the
critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.

### [278] [Effects of Wrist-Worn Haptic Feedback on Force Accuracy and Task Speed during a Teleoperated Robotic Surgery Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07327)
*Brian B. Vuong,Josie Davidson,Sangheui Cheon,Kyujin Cho,Allison M. Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introducing wrist-worn haptic feedback devices in teleoperated surgical robots improves accuracy in force application but impacts task completion speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating haptic feedback directly on hand-based tools in surgical robots can obstruct their operation; thus, relocating feedback to the wrist seeks to address this challenge.

Method: Participants practiced palpating phantom tissue with and without a soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device, applied forces were measured for accuracy.

Result: Statistically significant lower force error was observed with wrist-worn haptic feedback, though participants took longer to complete the task.

Conclusion: Relocated wrist-worn haptic feedback enhances force control in surgical tasks, but impacts operating speed, which may require optimization to balance precision and efficiency.

Abstract: Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can
improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of
teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However,
hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of
surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic
feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback
mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is
unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located
with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic
feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom
tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an
anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the
user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn
haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces.
Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when
wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the
palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic
feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to
operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniTracker integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into a student policy to enhance the diversity, fidelity, and stability of humanoid robot whole-body control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots require robust and generalizable control in human-centric environments, yet current methods struggle with motion diversity and generalization during policy distillation.

Method: UniTracker introduces a CVAE within the policy framework to model the latent diversity of human motion, leveraging a learned prior to enhance performance under partial observation conditions.

Result: UniTracker demonstrated superior motion quality, enhanced generalization to unseen behaviors, and improved robustness in both simulated and real-world environments compared to MLP-based DAgger baselines.

Conclusion: UniTracker offers a simplified and scalable solution for expressive and versatile humanoid control, successfully addressing existing limitations in diversity and generalization.

Abstract: Humanoid robots must achieve diverse, robust, and generalizable whole-body
control to operate effectively in complex, human-centric environments. However,
existing methods, particularly those based on teacher-student frameworks often
suffer from a loss of motion diversity during policy distillation and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen behaviors. In this work, we present
UniTracker, a simplified yet powerful framework that integrates a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into the student policy to explicitly model the
latent diversity of human motion. By leveraging a learned CVAE prior, our
method enables the student to retain expressive motion characteristics while
improving robustness and adaptability under partial observations. The result is
a single policy capable of tracking a wide spectrum of whole-body motions with
high fidelity and stability. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world deployments demonstrate that UniTracker significantly outperforms
MLP-based DAgger baselines in motion quality, generalization to unseen
references, and deployment robustness, offering a practical and scalable
solution for expressive humanoid control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current soft robot kinematic modeling techniques are challenged by high prediction uncertainty due to the robots' nonlinear and complex behavior, necessitating a method to quantify and minimize this uncertainty.

Method: The study evaluates linear and nonlinear machine learning models for kinematic modeling, identifies robust generalization in nonlinear ensemble methods, and introduces a split conformal prediction framework to quantify position uncertainty with distribution-free prediction intervals.

Result: Nonlinear ensemble methods demonstrate strong generalization performance, and the proposed framework provides theoretical guarantees for quantifying predictive position uncertainty in soft robots.

Conclusion: The integration of split conformal prediction ensures reliable kinematic modeling for soft robots, addressing prediction uncertainty and enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

TL;DR: The study introduces PILOC, a pheromone-based decentralized framework for Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR), outperforming existing techniques under dynamic, communication-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in MASAR arise from dynamic, unpredictable environments, necessitating efficient coordination and adaptability without global prior knowledge.

Method: PILOC utilizes a pheromone inverse guidance mechanism, incorporating it into the observation space of Deep Reinforcement Learning, and integrates local communication to ensure decentralized cooperation among agents.

Result: PILOC demonstrates improved search efficiency, adaptability, and robustness, especially in dynamic and communication-constrained scenarios, through extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: PILOC innovatively combines pheromone-based guidance with local communication, offering superior performance and insights into MASAR development under challenging environments.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

*Korbinian Moller,Rafael Neher,Marvin Seegert,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular runtime verification framework for motion planning in autonomous vehicles, emphasizing temporal consistency in trajectory outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring functional safety in motion planning for autonomous vehicles, particularly in complex or learning-based systems, is challenging within embedded real-time environments.

Method: The approach uses a prototypical implementation in a real-time system, employing constraint-based feasibility checks and cost-based metrics to detect unsafe trajectories.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate real-time operation abilities and the module's effectiveness in identifying unsafe trajectories.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for runtime trajectory verification for autonomous vehicles, with further plans for logic refinement and real-world validation.

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous
vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or
learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising
approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded
real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding
concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time
safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,
our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs
to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time
operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based
feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results
show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and
effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the
time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes
a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and
highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work
includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness
through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing. The code is

*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Guilherme V. Cavalheiro,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for improved navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments, combining scene coordinate regression with optimized trajectory control to minimize localization errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating indoor spaces without GPS requires precise localization methods as traditional systems like Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are prone to drift over time.

Method: The framework integrates evidential learning-based scene coordinate regression with a trajectory optimizer that directs the onboard camera toward reliable areas, alongside an SCR and IMU fusion through a fixed-lag smoothing technique.

Result: Simulation results show significant error reductions (translation: 54%/15%; rotation: 40%/31%) compared to traditional baselines, while hardware experiments confirm practicality.

Conclusion: The perception-aware approach successfully enhances localization for autonomous indoor flight, offering a robust alternative to drift-prone methods.

Abstract: Autonomous flight in GPS denied indoor spaces requires trajectories that keep
visual localization error tightly bounded across varied missions. Whereas
visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate
regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We
present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based
SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer
steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable
scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream
with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In
simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15%
(40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.
Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our
proposed framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for modular robot reconfiguration using graph isomorphism for better time and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable modular robot systems to transition efficiently into a new target configuration while minimizing time and energy usage.

Method: The proposed method uses graph isomorphism and a utility-based framework for module placement, aiming to retain original configurations and achieve Pareto-optimal allocation.

Result: Analytical proofs establish completeness and optimality, while simulations reveal low planning time and better performance over a market-based approach.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively reduces planning complexity and enhances efficiency in modular robot reconfiguration tasks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of configuration formation in modular robot systems
where a set of modules that are initially in different configurations and
located at different locations are required to assume appropriate positions so
that they can get into a new, user-specified, target configuration. We propose
a novel algorithm based on graph isomorphism, where the modules select
locations or spots in the target configuration using a utility-based framework,
while retaining their original configuration to the greatest extent possible,
to reduce the time and energy required by the modules to assume the target
configuration. We have shown analytically that our proposed algorithm is
complete and guarantees a Pareto-optimal allocation. Experimental simulations
of our algorithm with different number of modules in different initial
configurations and located initially at different locations, show that the
planning time of our algorithm is nominal (order of msec. for 100 modules). We
have also compared our algorithm against a market-based allocation algorithm
and shown that our proposed algorithm performs better in terms of time and
number of messages exchanged.

robot in the mechanism design allows providing accurate contact and fast
changing dynamic stimuli to the finger pad surface. The performance of the
developed display was evaluated in a two-stage user study of the perception of

*Julio Garrido,Javier Vales,Diego Silva-Muñiz,Enrique Riveiro,Pablo López-Matencio,Josué Rivera-Andrade*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to detect anomalies in Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) using motor torque data and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based unsupervised algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for anomaly detection in CDPRs rely on additional sensors, which may increase cost and complexity. This research aims to explore whether anomalies can be reliably detected using only motor torque data.

Method: The authors developed an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that fits a GMM on anomaly-free torque data during a calibration period. Real-time anomalies are flagged based on the Mahalanobis distance and dynamically updated GMM parameters.

Result: The method demonstrated high accuracy with a 100% true positive rate and a 95.4% true negative rate when validated in 14 test sessions simulating varied conditions. The algorithm showed better performance compared to alternative methods.

Conclusion: Using motor torque signals and an adaptive GMM-based algorithm provides a reliable, sensor-free solution for detecting anomalies in CDPRs, demonstrating robustness to environmental and operational variations.

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Conclusion: Enhanced robotic assistance in surgical training is effective for skill acquisition and transfer, making it a promising tool for medical education.

Abstract: The integration of high-level assistance algorithms in surgical robotics
training curricula may be beneficial in establishing a more comprehensive and
robust skillset for aspiring surgeons, improving their clinical performance as
a consequence. This work presents the development and validation of a
haptic-enhanced Virtual Reality simulator for surgical robotics training,
featuring 8 surgical tasks that the trainee can interact with thanks to the
embedded physics engine. This virtual simulated environment is augmented by the
introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at
re-directing the motion of the trainee's hands and wrists toward targets or
away from obstacles, and providing a quantitative performance score after the
execution of each training exercise.An experimental study shows that the
introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training
curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially,
promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical
scenario, like the clinical one.

Motivation: Structural monitoring faces coverage challenges due to static sensor networks, and deploying dynamic robot swarms can improve sensing capabilities and damage localization.

Method: The authors performed finite element analysis with Abaqus to simulate realistic vibration data and used Webots to model robot swarm dynamics. Techniques like Gaussian process estimators guided exploration, and operational modal analysis detected structural damages.

Result: The simulation validated the robot swarm's efficacy in detecting and localizing damages under various randomized scenarios, including different damage characteristics.

Conclusion: Robot swarms can effectively perform vibration-based structural inspections, showcasing their potential for distributed sensing applications.

Abstract: Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing
applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit
significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where
traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their
static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of
miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural
damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In
particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize
finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration
data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic
simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting
robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots'
exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii)
operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and
comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the
influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the
effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number,
locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation
studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for
vibration-based structural inspection.

Result: The investigation highlights the comparative performance of various fine-tuned LLM approaches in motion segmentation during fruit picking scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in simplifying and enhancing motion encoding tasks in Learning by Demonstration (LbD) applications, with potential benefits for real-life task automation.

Abstract: Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models

activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and
segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling,
twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this
work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task,
considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking
operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the vulnerabilities of existing feature-based SLAM systems that fail under varying lighting conditions due to fixed front-end parameters and unstable feature tracking.

Method: IRAF-SLAM employs (1) image enhancement to handle varying lighting, (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism based on image properties, and (3) a feature culling strategy using density analysis and lighting impact factors.

Result: Experimental validations on challenging datasets (TUM-VI and EuRoC) show IRAF-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art vSLAM methods in terms of accuracy and resilience under adverse illumination while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IRAF-SLAM demonstrates the potential of adaptive strategies to significantly enhance the robustness of visual SLAM systems in real-world, illuminated-varying scenarios.

Abstract: Robust Visual SLAM (vSLAM) is essential for autonomous systems operating in
real-world environments, where challenges such as dynamic objects, low texture,
and critically, varying illumination conditions often degrade performance.
Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making
them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To
address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and
Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in
complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image
enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying
lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that
dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel
intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that
filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a
lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European
Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly
reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in
improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational
overhead. The implementation of IRAF-SLAM is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the success and precision of MASO procedures, reducing dependency on surgeon experience and enhancing safety through a collaborative human-robot system.

Method: The authors implemented a task decomposition methodology to divide the surgical process into positional control, orientation control, and force-control tasks. They also employed an optical tracking system and developed new registration and calibration methods for patient tracking and navigation.

Result: Experiments on realistic phantom models demonstrated that their system achieved an average drilling point error of just 1.85 mm, showcasing high precision.

Conclusion: The proposed human-robot collaborative system shows promise in improving surgical outcomes for MASO through precise alignment, safety enhancements, and reduced reliance on surgeon experience.

Abstract: Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral
and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation,
its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a
human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a
preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition
methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three
subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the
robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to
ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a
skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the
patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a
dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method
are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The
experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which
demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling
points is 1.85mm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on quadruped robots managing unknown dynamic loads, presenting a load modeling approach combined with reinforcement learning to achieve better stability, adaptability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges quadruped robots face in managing unknown loads, including modeling load dynamics, capturing dynamics without external sensors, and stabilizing mutual load effects.

Method: A general load modeling approach, combined with reinforcement learning-based locomotion control, is used to infer load dynamics and stabilize loads effectively in the real world.

Result: Simulation experiments show superior performance in aspects like sudden load resistance, load stabilizing, and locomotion on rough terrains when compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances quadruped robots' ability to manage unknown dynamic loads in practical scenarios, making it more effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Unknown dynamic load carrying is one important practical application for
quadruped robots. Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges
in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics
of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the
dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to
interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this
work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics
modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed
modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load
movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the
sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We
conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the
effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Results show that our

### [293] [Perceptual Distortions and Autonomous Representation Learning in a Minimal Robotic System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07845)
*David Warutumo,Ciira wa Maina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines how sensory distortions in a robot's perception affect its autonomous navigation, showing it's still able to learn structured representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how perceptual distortions influence autonomous agents' ability to generate internal representations of their environment.

Method: Used a simulated two-wheeled robot with distance sensors and a compass in a square environment, analyzing its sensor data during random exploration.

Result: Found that despite perceptual distortions, the robot's emergent perceptual space correlates with the physical environment, enabling structured navigation representation.

Conclusion: Sensory distortions do not prevent autonomous agents from learning meaningful environment representations, contributing insights to embodied cognition and artificial life studies.

Abstract: Autonomous agents, particularly in the field of robotics, rely on sensory
information to perceive and navigate their environment. However, these sensory
inputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal
representation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these
perceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation
learning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled
robot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple
square environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random
exploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite
these distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space
that correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot
autonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit
spatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied
cognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated
navigation strategies in artificial life.

*Kavindie Katuwandeniya,Samith Rajapaksha Jayasekara Widhanapathirana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes "ROS Help Desk," a system aimed at simplifying error diagnosis and reducing downtime in ROS-based robotics systems by offering user-centric debugging tools and proactive error detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics systems increasingly integrate into daily life, yet their complexity, especially systems using ROS, creates barriers for users with limited technical expertise in diagnosing and resolving errors, leading to downtime and delays.

Method: The proposed system, ROS Help Desk, integrates intuitive debugging tools, proactive error detection, and multimodal data processing to dynamically provide error explanations and diagnostics based on users' expertise levels.

Result: The system was tested with artificially induced errors, showcasing its ability to accurately and proactively diagnose issues, thereby significantly reducing maintenance time.

Conclusion: ROS Help Desk can enhance human-robot collaboration by simplifying troubleshooting, enabling quicker diagnostics, and reducing maintenance downtime.

Abstract: As the robotics systems increasingly integrate into daily life, from smart
home assistants to the new-wave of industrial automation systems (Industry
4.0), there's an increasing need to bridge the gap between complex robotic
systems and everyday users. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible
framework often utilised in writing robot software, providing tools and
libraries for building complex robotic systems. However, ROS's distributed
architecture and technical messaging system create barriers for understanding
robot status and diagnosing errors. This gap can lead to extended maintenance
downtimes, as users with limited ROS knowledge may struggle to quickly diagnose
and resolve system issues. Moreover, this deficit in expertise often delays
proactive maintenance and troubleshooting, further increasing the frequency and
duration of system interruptions. ROS Help Desk provides intuitive error
explanations and debugging support, dynamically customized to users of varying
expertise levels. It features user-centric debugging tools that simplify error
diagnosis, implements proactive error detection capabilities to reduce
downtime, and integrates multimodal data processing for comprehensive system
state understanding across multi-sensor data (e.g., lidar, RGB). Testing
qualitatively and quantitatively with artificially induced errors demonstrates
the system's ability to proactively and accurately diagnose problems,
ultimately reducing maintenance time and fostering more effective human-robot
collaboration.

### [295] [Improving AEBS Validation Through Objective Intervention Classification Leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07872)
*Daniel Betschinske,Steven Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rule-based classification method to improve safety validation for Automatic Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS), addressing challenges like human bias and open-loop simulation complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Opening-loop resimulations of AEBS activations are complicated by uncertain data parameters and driver interventions, creating a need for unbiased validation techniques.

Method: The study uses the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to propose a rule-based classification system, applied to a simplified AEBS for analysis.

Result: The method shows strengths in improving transparency and consistency but also reveals its limitations and requirements for further development.

Conclusion: Combining this rule-based approach with human labeling enhances AEBS validation, offering a path toward better reliability and reproducibility in safety frameworks.

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

*Wanjia Fu,Hongyu Li,Ivy X. He,Stefanie Tellex,Srinath Sridhar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniTac introduces a touch-sensing approach relying solely on existing robot joint sensors, enabling contact localization without added tactile hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often lack built-in tactile skins, making it difficult to perform essential touch-sensing tasks for effective human-robot interaction (HRI).

Method: UniTac uses proprioceptive joint sensors with a data-driven algorithm to enable whole-body touch-sensing capabilities without additional hardware.

Result: Validated on Franka and Spot robots, UniTac achieved contact localization accuracy of 8.0 cm and 7.2 cm respectively, operating at 2,000 Hz using an RTX 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: UniTac provides an off-the-shelf solution for equipping robots with touch-sensing capabilities, potentially advancing HRI research without requiring hardware modifications.

Abstract: Robots can better interact with humans and unstructured environments through
touch sensing. However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile
skins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions,
such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body
touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not
require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot
equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to
democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers
to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our
approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On
Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can
localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU
without adding any additional sensors to the robot. Project website:

*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Elisa Schmid,Raymond Ochsner,Kurt Schneider,Jil Klünder*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a German dataset for sentiment analysis within software engineering and demonstrates its robustness for understanding emotional climate in developer teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the absence of German datasets in sentiment analysis tools tailored for software engineering, which are crucial for analyzing team emotions and productivity.

Method: A dataset comprising 5,949 German developer statements was compiled and annotated with six basic emotions by four German-speaking computer science students, based on Shaver et al.'s emotion model.

Result: The dataset exhibited high interrater agreement and reliability, proving it valid and robust for sentiment analysis in German-speaking software engineering contexts.

Conclusion: The work fills a significant gap in sentiment analysis tools for German-speaking developers, emphasizes the need for domain-specific solutions, and outlines pathways for further optimization and applications of the dataset.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential technique for investigating the emotional
climate within developer teams, contributing to both team productivity and
project success. Existing sentiment analysis tools in software engineering
primarily rely on English or non-German gold-standard datasets. To address this
gap, our work introduces a German dataset of 5,949 unique developer statements,
extracted from the German developer forum Android-Hilfe.de. Each statement was
annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver
et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the
annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These
results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support
sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community.
Evaluation with existing German sentiment analysis tools confirms the lack of
domain-specific solutions for software engineering. We also discuss approaches
to optimize annotation and present further use cases for the dataset.

*Martin Obaidi,Jannik Fischbach,Jakob Droste,Hannah Deters,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Steffen Krätzig,Hugo Villamizar,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents an automated tool-supported approach to derive explainability requirements and generate user-aligned explanations from user feedback. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of AI in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in transforming user feedback on explainability into structured requirements and explanations, as there is no systematic approach for this currently.

Method: The authors used an automated tool for deriving explainability requirements and generating explanations, and evaluated its performance using a dataset of 58 annotated user reviews obtained through collaboration with an industrial automation manufacturer.

Result: The AI-generated requirements lagged in relevance and correctness compared to human-derived ones, but AI-generated explanations were often preferred for their clarity and style, albeit less accurate.

Conclusion: Automated tools show potential for generating explanations but require human validation for correctness. The paper advances understanding of AI's effectiveness in this area and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: Explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement to enhance
transparency, build user trust, and ensure regulatory compliance. However,
translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured
requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing
methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no
established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating
aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a
tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its
effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to
create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted
explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while
AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to
human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for
their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue,
highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the
advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1)
introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and
generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the
strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3)
releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic
generation of explainability requirements.

### [300] [From Requirements to Code: Understanding Developer Practices in LLM-Assisted Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07548)
*Jonathan Ullrich,Matthias Koch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how developers use requirements for code generation with LLMs and proposes a theory that emphasizes the need for decomposing and enriching requirements before using them as input to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how developers currently use requirements in conjunction with LLMs for generating code, and to assess whether LLMs can fully replace traditional software engineering.

Method: The authors conducted interviews with 18 practitioners across 14 companies to understand how developers process and adapt requirements for LLM-based code generation.

Result: The study finds that requirements are typically too abstract to be directly input into LLMs. Developers decompose requirements into specific tasks and enrich them with design and architectural details prior to use.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that while LLMs offer impressive code generation capabilities, requirements engineering remains a critical step in the software development pipeline. This theory provides a framework for understanding the integration of LLMs in requirements-centric software engineering tasks.

Abstract: With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation
capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software
engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on
the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this
vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate
requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely
unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how
they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed
LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that
explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our
theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract
for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed
into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and
architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights
that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate
code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to
automating requirements-centric SE tasks.

*Kaicheng Huang,Fanyu Wang,Yutan Huang,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper conducts a systematic review of prompt engineering in requirements engineering and proposes a roadmap for its practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in LLMs have created opportunities for improving RE tasks via prompt engineering, but their uncertainty and lack of controllability hinder practical use.

Method: Following systematic review protocols, researchers analyzed 35 out of 867 screened studies, proposed a taxonomy linking PE patterns to RE roles, and highlighted gaps in current practices.

Result: The paper maps current uses of LLMs in RE, identifies research gaps, and creates a roadmap to transition from ad-hoc prototypes to structured, repeatable workflows.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering has significant potential for improving RE but requires structured methodologies to address its current uncertainty and implementation gaps.

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt
engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering
(RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant
uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on
how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy
implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented
systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following
Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital
libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring
order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links
technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented
RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with
five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt
types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we
outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can
evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular AI-driven approach using RAG models to automate requirements generation in the space industry, demonstrating feasibility and benefits for smaller space organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The space industry requires highly precise and complex requirements engineering, which poses challenges for smaller organizations and new entrants in handling extensive, unstructured documents.

Method: The approach involves preprocessing mission documents, classifying content, retrieving relevant info from standards, and synthesizing draft requirements using LLMs, applied to real-world missions in collaboration with industry partners.

Result: Preliminary results show reduced manual effort, improved requirements coverage, and simplified compliance alignment, supporting smaller organizations.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a roadmap for AI-driven requirements engineering workflows to lower entry barriers for smaller space organizations in safety-critical missions.

Abstract: Requirements engineering (RE) in the space industry is inherently complex,
demanding high precision, alignment with rigorous standards, and adaptability
to mission-specific constraints. Smaller space organisations and new entrants
often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured
documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory
standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate
requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven
approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into
semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content
from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language
models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the
space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in
collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our
preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,
improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance
alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE
workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate
in large-scale, safety-critical missions.

*Gustavo Menesse,Ana P. Millán,Joaquín J. Torres*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigates astrocyte modulation in the tripartite synapse model, exploring its effects on circuit dynamics and stimulus-driven activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between astrocyte modulation and synaptic mechanisms within higher-order neural interactions.

Method: Developed a higher-order model of the tripartite synapse including astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions; examined its dynamics in a recurrent circuit of three neurons.

Result: Higher-order modulation improves stability of circuit dynamics and increases parameter space for stimulus-driven activity.

Conclusion: Astrocyte-mediated higher-order interactions enhance effective connectivity and information processing in recurrent neural circuits.

Abstract: The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized
as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are
synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different
mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms,
the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the
so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the
competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have
yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the
tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in
short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and
pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability
of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term
plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a
minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation
that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit
is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to
external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different
synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation
robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that
supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism
by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information
processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest
recurrent circuits.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a brain stimulation framework, Online MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), which adjusts stimulation parameters dynamically using the brain's pre-stimulation state and achieves more precise neural modulation compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better influence and manipulate brain functions by tailoring stimulation techniques to the brain's pre-stimulation state, as traditional methods lack customized optimization driven by real-time neural conditions.

Method: OMiSO uses two innovations: leveraging brain state information before stimulation to select optimal parameters and adaptively refining parameters based on observed responses, tested through intracortical electrical microstimulation on a monkey.

Result: OMiSO surpassed other approaches by achieving greater accuracy in driving neural populations toward specified activity states, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: OMiSO represents a significant advancement in neuromodulation, enabling more accurate manipulation of neural activity, which could be pivotal for both understanding brain function and treating associated disorders.

Abstract: The coordinated activity of neural populations underlies myriad brain
functions. Manipulating this activity using brain stimulation techniques has
great potential for scientific and clinical applications, as it provides a tool
to causally influence brain function. The state of the brain affects how neural
populations respond to incoming sensory stimuli. Thus, taking into account
pre-stimulation neural population activity may be crucial to achieve a desired
causal manipulation using stimulation. In this work, we propose Online
MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a brain stimulation framework that
leverages brain state information to find stimulation parameters that can drive
neural population activity toward specified states. OMiSO includes two key
advances: i) it leverages the pre-stimulation brain state to choose optimal
stimulation parameters, and ii) it adaptively refines the choice of those
parameters by considering newly-observed stimulation responses. We tested OMiSO
by applying intracortical electrical microstimulation in a monkey and found
that it outperformed competing methods that do not incorporate these advances.
Taken together, OMiSO provides greater accuracy in achieving specified activity
states, thereby advancing neuromodulation technologies for understanding the
brain and for treating brain disorders.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel conformal prediction method for classification tasks with multiple observations available at prediction time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve uncertainty quantification and predictive performance in classification tasks when multiple inputs for the same instance are available, a scenario common in citizen science applications like Pl@ntNet.

Method: They propose aggregating p-values from multiple observations using a general framework based on scoring functions, which encompasses classical statistical tools and refines standard strategies such as majority voting.

Result: The proposed method improves predictive set accuracy and reduces its size while maintaining the required coverage guarantee, as demonstrated on simulated and real-world datasets, including the Pl@ntNet platform.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates information from multiple observations and can improve classification accuracy in tasks involving citizen science data.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

*Nicole Abreu,Parker B. Edwards,Francis Motta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates using unreduced boundary matrices for topological feature vectors in machine learning pipelines, showing comparable performance to fully reduced persistence diagrams with potential computational benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent homology features are often computationally expensive and prone to information loss in fully reduced persistence diagrams, prompting the exploration of alternative methods.

Method: Introduced methods to generate topological feature vectors from unreduced boundary matrices and conducted experimental comparisons with fully-reduced persistence diagrams across various tasks and datasets.

Result: Models trained on unreduced persistence diagrams performed on par and sometimes outperformed those trained on fully-reduced persistence diagrams.

Conclusion: Utilizing unreduced boundary matrices can reduce computational costs and improve performance in machine learning pipelines using topology-based features.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

TL;DR: This paper explores the phenomenon of double descent in over-parameterized models from a Bayesian perspective, demonstrating compatibility with Bayesian principles like Occam's razor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the double descent phenomenon in machine learning through the lens of Bayesian principles, which has not been fully explored yet.

Method: The authors provide a Bayesian interpretation of the double descent behavior and use an example of Bayesian model selection in neural networks to illustrate their approach.

Result: The study reveals that the double descent phenomenon aligns with Bayesian principles and supports Occam's razor, which advocates for simpler models.

Conclusion: Double descent can be naturally understood through Bayesian perspectives, and findings encourage further research into its implications within Bayesian frameworks.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper integrates second-order proposals into SMC$^2$ for Bayesian inference, improving accuracy and computational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and computational efficiency in Bayesian inference using SMC methods while addressing the poor accuracy caused by suboptimal proposal distributions.

Method: The authors introduce second-order proposals, utilizing both gradient and Hessian (curvature) information about the target distribution, within the SMC$^2$ framework.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved step-size selection and better posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating second-order proposals in SMC$^2$ enhances its robustness and precision, offering a significant advancement for Bayesian inference in high-performance computing environments.

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

*Haojie Liu,Zihan Lin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes Galerkin-ARIMA, a model that integrates spline-based functions into ARIMA to handle non-linear dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARIMA models are limited by linear assumptions and high computational demands, especially with large and complex datasets.

Method: The AR component of ARIMA is replaced with a spline-based function, estimated via Galerkin projection, while retaining the MA component and Gaussian noise assumptions.

Result: A closed-form OLS estimator is derived for Galerkin coefficients, proving the method is asymptotically unbiased and consistent.

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA bridges traditional time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, enhancing forecasting accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which
offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

### [310] [A Unified Empirical Risk Minimization Framework for Flexible N-Tuples Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07771)
*Shuying Huang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for N-tuples learning, incorporating pointwise unlabeled data to improve weakly-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning and unify existing N-tuples learning methods under a theoretical foundation.

Method: The authors introduce a framework based on empirical risk minimization, deriving a probabilistic formulation, unbiased risk estimator, and generalization error bounds.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in generalization across various weakly supervised tasks by integrating pointwise unlabeled data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a flexible, theoretically-supported approach to N-tuples learning, improving performance while tackling overfitting challenges.

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

### [311] [Generative Panoramic Image Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07133)
*Mathieu Tuli,Kaveh Kamali,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new generative method for panoramic image stitching to address challenges like parallax, lighting, and style variations between reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image stitching methods struggle with artifacts like ghosting in complex scenarios, and current generative models fail to synthesize large, coherent panoramic regions.

Method: The authors fine-tune a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve scene content and layout, enabling seamless outpainting of panoramas from multiple reference images.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baselines in image quality and structural consistency on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned diffusion models can effectively address limitations of existing methods, offering a stronger solution for panoramic image stitching tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SD-GS, a method for improving dynamic scene reconstruction, focusing on reducing storage costs while maintaining visual quality through a deformable anchor grid and adaptive densification strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks struggle with the trade-off between high storage costs and the ability to model complex physical motions, limiting their practical applications.

Method: The authors introduce a deformable anchor grid for hierarchical scene representation and a deformation-aware densification strategy that focuses resources on high-dynamic regions while reducing redundancy in static areas.

Result: The proposed SD-GS method achieves an average 60% reduction in model size and a 100% improvement in FPS while maintaining or exceeding state-of-the-art visual quality.

Conclusion: SD-GS demonstrates a compact, efficient, and visually superior approach for dynamic scene reconstruction, overcoming storage and motion complexity limitations.

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in matting algorithms for capture stage content and proposes solutions for improved workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common matting algorithms fail with the unique characteristics of capture stage content, necessitating improved methodologies.

Method: The authors share insights, propose a guideline, demonstrate an efficient pipeline, and validate using a diffusion model.

Result: They develop an adaptive matting method requiring minimal annotations, applicable both offline and in real-time, and validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work provides actionable guidelines and a robust workflow to enhance the matting of capture stage content.

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

TL;DR: RTR-GS introduces a novel inverse rendering framework for reflective objects using multi-view images to achieve improved synthesis and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), rendering reflective objects and achieving reliable inverse rendering remain challenging.

Method: The framework uses a hybrid rendering model combining forward rendering for radiance transfer and deferred rendering for reflections, refining BRDF and lighting decomposition with a physically-based deferred rendering branch.

Result: Experimental results indicate RTR-GS improves view synthesis, geometry recovery, BRDF decomposition, and relighting while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: RTR-GS effectively addresses limitations in reflective object rendering and decomposition, offering robust solutions for view synthesis and relighting tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an innovative, sensitive, and label-free method for detecting neurotransmitters, which holds importance in biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience.

Method: The study uses aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as plasmonic substrates to enhance fluorescence signals, alongside machine learning algorithms, especially LSTM, to analyze fluorescence data and classify neurotransmitters.

Result: The results demonstrate up to 12-fold fluorescence enhancement with AlCNCs and over 89% classification accuracy using LSTM algorithms.

Conclusion: The research highlights the successful integration of AlCNC-enhanced fluorescence and ML techniques, making a significant contribution to biosensing and biomolecule detection methods.

Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating advanced plasmonic
nanomaterials and machine learning (ML) for high-precision biomolecule
detection. We leverage aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as an innovative
plasmonic substrate to enhance the native fluorescence of neurotransmitters,
including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid (DOPAC). AlCNCs amplify weak fluorescence signals, enabling probe-free,
label-free detection and differentiation of these molecules with great
sensitivity and specificity. To further improve classification accuracy, we
employ ML algorithms, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks playing a
central role in analyzing time-dependent fluorescence data. Comparative
evaluations with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) demonstrate
the superior performance of LSTM in distinguishing neurotransmitters. The
results reveal that AlCNC substrates provide up to a 12-fold enhancement in
fluorescence intensity for DA, 9-fold for NE, and 7-fold for DOPAC compared to
silicon substrates. At the same time, ML algorithms achieve classification
accuracy exceeding 89%. This interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap
between nanotechnology and ML, showcasing the synergistic potential of
AlCNC-enhanced native fluorescence and ML in biosensing. The framework paves
the way for probe-free, label-free biomolecule profiling, offering

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: MODA introduces a unified diffusion model framework for molecular design that integrates several tasks into a single workflow, surpassing previous models in accuracy and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations like fragmented task approaches, low stereochemical fidelity, and lack of zero-shot transfer in molecular design models.

Method: A diffusion framework with a Bayesian mask scheduler enabling multi-task training by masking and denoising spatial fragments in one pass.

Result: MODA outperforms existing models in substructure accuracy, chemical property prediction, interaction modeling, and geometry fidelity, while also showing improved zero-shot design capabilities.

Conclusion: A single-stage, multi-task diffusion framework like MODA can streamline the molecular design process and replace traditional two-stage workflows effectively.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now
reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks.
SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and
one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment,
and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies
fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration
with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment
is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared
geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a
universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training
paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry.
Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while
maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but
trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and
lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high
improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate
that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage
workflows for structure-based molecular design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISME, a framework to unify molecular embeddings from multiple data sources and highlights its superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecular embedding methods are limited to specific tasks or data types, restricting their ability to capture comprehensive biological functions.

Method: Uses a systematic evaluation of molecular representations, proposes an adjusted SVCCA to assess redundancy across modalities, and integrates data via an autoencoder-based framework (PRISME).

Result: PRISME surpasses individual embedding methods, especially in missing value imputation tasks, affirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of integrating multiple molecular embedding sources into a unified representation for versatile biomedical applications.

Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are
restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness
within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of
gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this
study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of
biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner
spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data,
literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To
distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we
devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different
data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings
capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of
embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for
Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a
machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these
heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated
this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated
consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in
missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling
of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable
multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent technologies in smart cities, IoT, and autonomous systems demand high-performance wireless localization and sensing for optimized efficiency and intelligent applications.

Method: The paper formulates localization and sensing as a mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and introduces the SPG-MIBO algorithm, which employs stochastic proximal gradient-based optimization with mini-batch training.

Result: Experimental validation on various datasets demonstrates effectiveness and shows performance improvements from the joint optimization of localization and sensing.

Conclusion: SPG-MIBO presents an advanced approach for joint modeling, addressing the challenges of high-dimensional MIMO-OFDM systems, with theoretical support and demonstrated benefits in experimental settings.

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

TL;DR: DAF is a framework for on-device training that reduces memory usage and speeds up training processes on mobile and edge devices by optimizing system-level challenges such as activation compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient activation compression to enable deep neural network training on memory-constrained mobile and edge devices, where activations significantly dominate memory use.

Method: DAF introduces system-level optimizations like hybrid reduction operations, collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing, and importance-aware memory paging to reduce memory use and computational overhead during dynamic quantization training.

Result: DAF achieves up to a 22.9× reduction in memory usage and a 3.2× speedup during training on deep learning models tested across embedded and mobile platforms, without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: DAF provides scalable and practical support for on-device training in resource-constrained environments, addressing key system bottlenecks effectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the IML-Spikeformer, an energy-efficient spiking Transformer designed for large-scale speech processing, addressing training overhead and lack of tailored architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for energy-efficient computing but face challenges in large-scale speech processing tasks due to high training costs and absence of dedicated architectures.

Method: The IML-Spikeformer employs an Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS) mechanism for efficient spike simulations, incorporates a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM) with a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module to model multi-scale temporal speech dependencies.

Result: IML-Spikeformer achieved word error rates of 6.0% on AiShell-1 and 3.4% on Librispeech-960, similar to ANN transformers while reducing theoretical energy consumption by 4.64× and 4.32× respectively.

Conclusion: IML-Spikeformer demonstrates that SNN architectures can be competitive in performance and energy efficiency for large-scale speech processing tasks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms,
represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers
energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve
competitive performance on large-scale speech processing task. Two key
challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training
caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN
architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we
introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking
Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech
processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)
mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep
using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further
integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a
Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module
enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale
temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that
IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on
Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing
theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$
respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures
for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy
efficiency.

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning approach to classify pole structures in $S$-matrix elements, achieving high accuracy and generalizing to experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of identifying new hadronic states and resolving ambiguities in pole structures near the mass threshold, crucial for understanding exotic signals in hadron spectroscopy.

Method: An uncertainty-aware machine learning technique using an ensemble of classifier chains provides classifications with predictive uncertainty, applied to both synthetic and experimental data.

Result: The model achieves nearly 95% validation accuracy, generalizes to experimental data like the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state, and identifies a four-pole structure for this state.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, effective tool for studying pole structures in scattering amplitudes, with broad applicability beyond the example studied.

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is
limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning
approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is
based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on
predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while
discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on
synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the
$P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole
structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the
presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While
evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to
other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure
inference in scattering amplitudes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the overlooked complexity and emergent hierarchical organization in multicomponent systems.

Method: Compare statistical mixtures with multicomponent systems to illustrate structural differences.

Result: Multicomponent systems exhibit unique types of structural complexity, influencing their ergodic behavior.

Conclusion: Recognizing the complexity in multicomponent systems may lead to new insights on system ergodicity and organization.

Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much
more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely
more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical
mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent
hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural
complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad
consequences for system ergodicity.

TL;DR: The paper explores the implications of distributed and decentralised AI training setups on governance, risks, benefits, and relevant policy mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the emerging shift in AI training setups towards distributed and decentralised systems and examine their governance implications.

Method: The paper distinguishes distributed and decentralised training scenarios, discusses their risks and benefits, and evaluates relevant policy mechanisms.

Result: It highlights potential governance challenges such as compute structuring risks, capability proliferation, and reduced detectability, while acknowledging benefits like privacy-preservation and reduced power concentration.

Conclusion: The study aims to inform precise policies for managing AI compute, proliferation, and decentralised development trends.

Abstract: Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from
centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across
multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This
paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised
training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse.
We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased
risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of
detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new
paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we
emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We
also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including
privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and
mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise
policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI
development.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining statistical physics and control theory to design optimal learning protocols for neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding and inefficient heuristic approaches in finding optimal learning protocols for neural networks.

Method: Developing a unified theoretical framework using statistical physics and control theory, deriving equations to model learning dynamics, and solving optimal control problems for neural network training.

Result: Optimal strategies for various scenarios like curricula design, regularization, and noise schedules are derived, balancing informative input alignment and noise minimization.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to designing optimal learning protocols and paves the way for grounded meta-learning theories based on statistical physics.

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

### [325] [Large-scale portfolio optimization with variational neural annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07159)
*Nishan Ranabhat,Behnam Javanparast,David Goerz,Estelle Inack*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variational Neural Annealing (VNA) for optimizing large-scale portfolios under complex real-world constraints efficiently and compares its performance favorably against state-of-the-art optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced in portfolio optimization when dealing with mixed-integer nonlinear programming under constraints like turnover limits and transaction costs, which traditional optimizers struggle to solve.

Method: The authors use a classical Ising-like Hamiltonian representation of the problem and implement Variational Neural Annealing (VNA) with autoregressive neural networks for optimization.

Result: VNA achieves near-optimal portfolio solutions for more than 2,000 assets, outperforming traditional optimizers like Mosek in convergence speed on challenging instances.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficiency and scalability of VNA, demonstrating its universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling across different financial indices, making it a promising tool for portfolio optimization.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

*Abdelrahman S. Abdelrahman,Shuvro Chowdhury,Flaviano Morone,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA) to improve optimization tasks using probabilistic computers and Ising machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an efficient optimization algorithm that leverages the capabilities of modern probabilistic computers and Ising machines, addressing limitations of existing methods like Simulated Annealing and QAOA.

Method: The PAOA algorithm iteratively modifies the couplings of binary stochastic units guided by cost evaluations from independent samples, with a principled variational approach linking updates to the full Markov flow of the system.

Result: PAOA demonstrated superior performance over QAOA in solving optimization problems like the 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and it achieved improvements over Simulated Annealing in heavy-tailed problem scenarios.

Conclusion: The PAOA framework enhances classical optimization methods, bridges theoretical principles with practical applications, and facilitates better utilization of current probabilistic computing technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

*Yang Li,Yuchao Ma,Qi Qi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimal mechanism for single-slot joint advertising and proposes BundleNet, a neural network approach achieving state-of-the-art results in multi-slot joint advertising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint advertising mechanisms overlook bundle structures and fail to achieve optimal revenue enhancement and allocation efficiency.

Method: Develop an optimal single-slot advertising mechanism and use BundleNet, a bundle-based neural network, for scalable multi-slot joint advertising.

Result: BundleNet approximates theoretical single-slot results and excels in multi-slot settings, increasing platform revenue while maintaining incentive compatibility and individual rationality.

Conclusion: The approach advances joint advertising mechanisms, enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue across single-slot and multi-slot settings.

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

### [328] [Feature-free regression kriging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07382)
*Peng Luo,Yilong Wu,Yongze Song*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feature-Free Regression Kriging (FFRK), a spatial interpolation method that uses geospatial features instead of external explanatory variables for trend surface modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geostatistical interpolation methods like Ordinary Kriging struggle to account for nonstationarity in spatial data, and existing solutions like Regression Kriging require high-quality explanatory variables, which are often unavailable.

Method: FFRK automatically extracts geospatial features (local dependence, heterogeneity, and geosimilarity) to model trends in spatial data without external explanatory variables.

Result: FFRK consistently outperformed 17 classical interpolation methods, including conventional Kriging and machine learning models, in predicting heavy metal concentrations in an Australian mining area.

Conclusion: Utilizing extracted geospatial features can enhance spatial prediction accuracy and reduce reliance on advanced statistical models or external explanatory variables, offering a cost-effective solution to address spatial nonstationarity.

Abstract: Spatial interpolation is a crucial task in geography. As perhaps the most
widely used interpolation methods, geostatistical models -- such as Ordinary
Kriging (OK) -- assume spatial stationarity, which makes it difficult to
capture the nonstationary characteristics of geographic variables. A common
solution is trend surface modeling (e.g., Regression Kriging, RK), which relies
on external explanatory variables to model the trend and then applies
geostatistical interpolation to the residuals. However, this approach requires
high-quality and readily available explanatory variables, which are often
lacking in many spatial interpolation scenarios -- such as estimating heavy
metal concentrations underground. This study proposes a Feature-Free Regression
Kriging (FFRK) method, which automatically extracts geospatial features --
including local dependence, local heterogeneity, and geosimilarity -- to
construct a regression-based trend surface without requiring external
explanatory variables. We conducted experiments on the spatial distribution
prediction of three heavy metals in a mining area in Australia. In comparison
with 17 classical interpolation methods, the results indicate that FFRK, which
does not incorporate any explanatory variables and relies solely on extracted
geospatial features, consistently outperforms both conventional Kriging
techniques and machine learning models that depend on explanatory variables.
This approach effectively addresses spatial nonstationarity while reducing the
cost of acquiring explanatory variables, improving both prediction accuracy and
generalization ability. This finding suggests that an accurate characterization
of geospatial features based on domain knowledge can significantly enhance
spatial prediction performance -- potentially yielding greater improvements
than merely adopting more advanced statistical models.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using mmWave radar to explore crowd motion patterns and semantics through high-fidelity flow fields, geometric graphs, and analysis techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding complex crowd motion patterns and extracting meaningful crowd semantics using innovative sensing and analysis techniques.

Method: A signal processing pipeline generates mmWave flow fields, converts them into directed geometric graphs, and employs Jacobian-based analysis with curl and divergence to interpret crowd semantics.

Result: The framework successfully reconstructs complex crowd flow structures and provides accurate crowd semantics (e.g., shifts, dispersals, gatherings) in experiments involving up to 20 people using mmWave radar.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust capabilities in decoding crowd dynamics, validating its value for crowd analytics applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the concept of 'conjugated capabilities,' interrelated human traits that allow effort redistribution to overcome limitations, particularly for automation and human interaction. It presents a network-based framework to optimize use cases like task allocation in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve human-autonomy interaction by understanding and leveraging the interplay between human capabilities to adapt machine behavior and overcome human limitations.

Method: The authors analyze interrelations among elementary capabilities using the IMBA standard and post-rehabilitation patient data to uncover conjugated capabilities. They employ a graph-based representation to identify and utilize these connections.

Result: The study identifies networks of conjugated capabilities that inform task allocation and optimization frameworks. Case studies demonstrate applications like optimizing IMBA test designs for faster recordings.

Conclusion: The findings underline the potential of using conjugated capabilities to benefit human-autonomy collaboration. Applications in task allocation and performance optimization are promising areas for future exploration.

Abstract: Human and automation capabilities are the foundation of every human-autonomy
interaction and interaction pattern. Therefore, machines need to understand the
capacity and performance of human doing, and adapt their own behavior,
accordingly. In this work, we address the concept of conjugated capabilities,
i.e. capabilities that are dependent or interrelated and between which effort
can be distributed. These may be used to overcome human limitations, by
shifting effort from a deficient to a conjugated capability with performative
resources. For example: A limited arm's reach may be compensated by tilting the
torso forward. We analyze the interrelation between elementary capabilities
within the IMBA standard to uncover potential conjugation, and show evidence in
data of post-rehabilitation patients. From the conjugated capabilities, within
the example application of stationary manufacturing, we create a network of
interrelations. With this graph, a manifold of potential uses is enabled. We
showcase the graph's usage in optimizing IMBA test design to accelerate data
recordings, and discuss implications of conjugated capabilities on task
allocation between the human and an autonomy.

*Line Abele,Gerrit Anders,Tolgahan Aydın,Jürgen Buder,Helen Fischer,Dominik Kimmel,Markus Huff*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of vision-language models (VLMs) like InternVL2 to generate metadata for museum and archival photographic catalogs, evaluating the quality of generated descriptions and human trust in AI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of photographic collections has outpaced the feasibility of manual cataloging, prompting a need for AI-assisted tools like VLMs to automate metadata generation.

Method: The study used a vision-language model (InternVL2) to generate catalog descriptions for archaeological photographs, which were evaluated by experts and non-experts for quality, accuracy, and trustworthiness in a human-centered experimental framework.

Result: Participants could identify AI-generated descriptions above chance level, but descriptions rated higher in accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify. Problems such as OCR errors and hallucination lowered perceived quality, and experts showed lower trust and willingness to adopt AI tools.

Conclusion: While AI shows potential for supporting cataloging tasks, human review is essential to ensure quality and accuracy. A collaborative model combining AI and human oversight, alongside fostering trust and explainable AI systems, is needed for successful adoption, particularly in specialized domains.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

Method: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 16 public speaking experts to gather their opinions and insights.

Result: Experts highlighted the value of AI for repetitive tasks but criticized current tools for lacking personalized and well-designed feedback. A hybrid approach combining AI with coaching was favored.

Conclusion: AI tools can complement traditional coaching by addressing technical aspects, but need improvements in personalization and instructional design for better integration.

Abstract: Background: Public speaking is a vital professional skill, yet it remains a
source of significant anxiety for many individuals. Traditional training relies
heavily on expert coaching, but recent advances in AI has led to novel types of
commercial automated public speaking feedback tools. However, most research has

groups with public speaking experts. Participants discussed their views on
current commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional
coaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.
  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in
handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus
on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools,
emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected
feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents FedP3E, a novel Federated Learning framework designed to enhance malware detection in IoT ecosystems while addressing challenges of class imbalance and non-IID data distributions. Key innovations include privacy-preserving prototype sharing and SMOTE-based augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing need for malware detection in IoT ecosystems while ensuring privacy and combating challenges posed by class imbalance and heterogeneous data distributions.

Method: FedP3E constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models, perturbs them with noise for privacy, and exchanges these summaries instead of raw data. SMOTE-based augmentation is integrated to improve minority class detection.

Result: FedP3E demonstrated resilience to statistical heterogeneity and effective representation of minority malware classes while maintaining low communication overhead during testing on the N-BaIoT dataset.

Conclusion: FedP3E enables decentralized malware detection with improved performance on imbalanced IoT-generated data while preserving privacy and minimizing communication requirements.

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

Motivation: Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated, necessitating detection systems that balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Conduct a comparative analysis of ML, DL, and quantized small-parameter LLMs using a curated dataset, exploring accuracy, prompting strategies, rephrased phishing email effects, and adversarial evaluations.

Result: LLMs show potential for context-based phishing detection but underperform in raw accuracy compared to ML/DL; models like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B achieve competitive accuracy above 80% with reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: Optimized lightweight LLMs are viable for phishing defense, combining cost-effectiveness, explainability, and efficiency within cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into
modern cybersecurity frameworks.

TL;DR: Recent research evaluates the robustness of fine-tuning-based prompt injection defenses on large language models (LLMs). Using an optimization-based attack algorithm, it showed that these defenses have vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the security claims and robustness of popular LLM defenses against prompt injection attacks, particularly those reliant on fine-tuning.

Method: Develop a novel attention-based optimization attack algorithm and apply it to two specific whitebox defenses (SecAlign and StruQ).

Result: The attacks demonstrated up to 70% success rates with a modest increase in attacker budget and highlighted vulnerabilities in the evaluated defenses.

Conclusion: Current approaches to prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting fail to deliver claimed robustness, requiring deeper investigation into improved security mechanisms.

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

TL;DR: Critical infrastructure systems face cyber threats but can benefit from a hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity framework to improve detection, modeling, and remediation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing interconnectivity of critical infrastructures like energy, healthcare, and transport networks raises cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid AI-driven framework to address vulnerability detection, threat modelling, and automated threat remediation in real-time.

Result: The study identifies actionable insights and approaches for enhancing the cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure systems.

Conclusion: AI-driven strategies can significantly mitigate risks and improve the resilience of critical infrastructures, though complexities like adversarial AI and regulatory challenges remain.

Abstract: Critical infrastructure systems, including energy grids, healthcare
facilities, transportation networks, and water distribution systems, are

### [340] [Mitigating Watermark Stealing Attacks in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07871)
*Toluwani Aremu,Noor Hussein,Munachiso Nwadike,Samuele Poppi,Jie Zhang,Karthik Nandakumar,Neil Gong,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of watermark stealing attacks on generative AI (GenAI) models and proposes a method to mitigate such threats using a multi-key extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to protect GenAI providers against watermark stealing attacks where users forge watermarks into content not generated by the provider's models, potentially creating harmful accusations.

Method: The authors propose a multi-key watermarking extension that can be retrofitted to any existing watermarking method, treating the watermark as a black-box. This extension is evaluated through theoretical guarantees, empirical studies, and security games modeling the threat.

Result: The proposed method substantially reduces the effectiveness of watermark forging attacks, as shown through theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: This approach ensures better protection of watermarking systems in generative AI by mitigating stealing attacks without requiring modifications to the watermarking generation process.

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

*Youqian Zhang,Xinyu Ji,Zhihao Wang,Qinhong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper uncovers a new type of electromagnetic signal injection attack that manipulates CMOS image sensors' analog domain, causing rainbow-like color artifacts and significant mispredictions in object detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a critical vulnerability in safety-critical systems relying on image sensors by exploring how physical-layer attacks compromise visual data integrity.

Method: Investigate electromagnetic interference as a means to affect CMOS image sensors and evaluate its impact on object detection models.

Result: Demonstrated that electromagnetic attacks induce rainbow-like color artifacts on CMOS image sensors, destabilizing object detection algorithms.

Conclusion: Physical-layer vulnerabilities represent a serious risk to visual perception systems, necessitating the development of more robust defenses.

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework integrating mathematical modeling, ANN, MOO, and MCDM for optimizing SMR reactors, achieving efficient and accurate solutions for conflicting objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational complexity and conflicting objectives in catalytic reactor systems, this study aims to develop a comprehensive and scalable optimization framework.

Method: The study uses a one-dimensional reactor model, constructs a hybrid ANN surrogate to reduce computational costs, employs NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization, and utilizes MCDM methods like TOPSIS and sPROBID for solution ranking.

Result: The framework demonstrated successful optimization of methane conversion and hydrogen output, achieving a notable reduction in computational time while maintaining accuracy. Key results included methane conversions of up to 0.988 and hydrogen outputs of 4.556 mol/s.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively optimizes catalytic reactor performance, offering a scalable approach for systems with complex and conflicting objectives.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was
constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into
three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2)
maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a
combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further
ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on
the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a
methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case,
and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon
dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and
effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with
multiple, often conflicting, objectives.

*Yingtao Luo,Reza Skandari,Carlos Martinez,Arman Kilic,Rema Padman*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper focuses on using machine learning models for better predicting heart transplant waitlist outcomes using longitudinal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, decisions for heart transplant waitlist are made by doctors based on ad-hoc processes, despite the availability of patient, donor, and organ data.

Method: The study benchmarks machine learning models for modeling waitlist mortality and evaluates them against 23,807 patient records with 77 variables for survival prediction within 1 year.

Result: The best model achieves a strong performance with a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, improving over previous models and identifying both known and novel risk factors.

Conclusion: This machine learning approach can improve urgency assessments and inform policy refinement for heart transplant decisions.

Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are
currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the
process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal
patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) since 2018, there is increasing interest in analytical
approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ
availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage
longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling
of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and
evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our
best model achieves a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, significantly
outperforming previous models. Key predictors align with known risk factors
while also revealing novel associations. Our findings can support urgency
assessment and policy refinement in heart transplant decision making.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum software development faces challenges like lack of hardware and high computational requirements. A proposed solution involves remote computation to improve workflow, enabling faster execution and support for larger circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers struggle with the limited availability of quantum computers, the complexity of simulating quantum systems on classical hardware, and the challenges of integrating current accelerators into development workflows. This creates inefficiencies in quantum software development.

Method: The paper explores using remote computational capabilities to simplify the transition between local and remote execution environments and to provide speedup for developers working with quantum simulators. A plug-and-play kernel for Jupyter notebooks was developed.

Result: The proposed solution achieves up to a 5x speedup in quantum circuit execution runtime and supports quantum circuits involving 21 to 29 qubits.

Conclusion: Remote computational capabilities can significantly enhance the workflow and enable more complex quantum software development through faster execution and greater scalability.

Abstract: Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically
transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize
this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to
effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant
challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited
availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of
simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology
stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments.
These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient
workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the
potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to
improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of
moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote
hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The
goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an
iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution
presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit
execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple
plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing need for robust, portable, and scalable quantum software tools as quantum computing transitions into practical use.

Result: The effectiveness is demonstrated via two scenarios: automated benchmarking and hybrid validation, highlighting simplified quantum development workflows.

TL;DR: ProvideQ is a toolbox facilitating hybrid quantum-classical solvers for real-world optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of integrating quantum and classical optimization methods due to the absence of a seamless technological stack.

Method: The authors developed the ProvideQ toolbox, which utilizes Meta-Solver strategies to split problems into classical and quantum subroutines interactively.

Result: ProvideQ successfully demonstrates the integration of quantum subroutines into existing frameworks but highlights the need for better hardware for competitive performance.

Conclusion: While ProvideQ showcases promising potential for hybrid solvers in current applications, advancements in hardware are crucial for broader competitive utility.

Abstract: Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages
of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational
challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their
practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack
that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical
optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ
toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure
hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements
decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum
subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such
decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines
well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that
are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the
technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and
demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof
of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of
quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to
make their performance competitive.

### [348] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel recommendation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with traditional algorithms like SVD to provide better personalized movie recommendations based on user text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems are not adept at personalizing suggestions using text-based user preferences. This paper aims to bridge the gap using advances in LLMs.

Method: The researchers combined traditional SVD/SVD++ algorithms for initial recommendations and refined these outputs using LLMs to incorporate text-based user preferences. Comparisons were conducted using MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset and validation metrics.

Result: The LLM-enhanced framework significantly outperformed SVD and SVD++ in all evaluation metrics, achieving up to 6x improvement in cumulative hit rates and 3.7x in NDCG with minor computational overhead.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs enables a substantial improvement in personalized recommendation quality, making the framework both highly effective and adaptable to user-specific preferences.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper explores Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for financial time series forecasting, highlighting the effectiveness of pretraining models like Tiny Time Mixers (TTM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial forecasting challenges arise from nonlinear relationships, temporal and variable dependencies, and limited data availability. The paper seeks improvement through TSFMs.

Method: TSFMs are pretrained on diverse time series datasets and evaluated across three financial forecasting tasks. Performance is compared between pretrained and untrained models.

Result: Pretrained TTM outperformed in scenarios with limited and extensive datasets, achieved zero-shot success in some tasks, and exhibited significant sample efficiency, needing fewer years of data.

Conclusion: TSFMs show promise in data-constrained scenarios but need domain-specific pretraining and architectural optimization to achieve task-specific competitive performance.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to
complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable
interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks
involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market
assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution
through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific
adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)
across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,
EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM
exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version
of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained
version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and
15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's
zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting
and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can
surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model
consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable
performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant
sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,
traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of
three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific
optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer
substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,
data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires
domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial
time series characteristics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASE_Res_UNet, a novel deep learning model for segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy images, excelling in noisy and challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address segmentation challenges posed by noisy conditions and dense filament networks in fluorescence microscopy images, which are common in biomedical applications.

Method: The researchers created annotated synthetic datasets with realistic noise and varying fluorescence intensities. They designed ASE_Res_UNet, integrating residual blocks and adaptive SE attention mechanisms for better performance.

Result: ASE_Res_UNet outperformed other models, excelling in noise resilience and low-intensity structure detection. It showed superior performance on challenging datasets and generalized well to real-world microscopy images and other curvilinear structures.

Conclusion: ASE_Res_UNet is highly effective for biomedical image segmentation, with strong potential for disease diagnosis and treatment in noisy, low-contrast conditions.

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DpDNet, a specialized segmentation model for PET-CT that incorporates cancer-specific and shared knowledge prompts to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET-CT lesion segmentation has unique challenges due to small and variable lesion morphology, noise, and interference from high-metabolic physiological signals. Existing models treat all cancers as the same task, ignoring their unique features.

Method: The authors propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network, which uses cancer-specific and shared prompts to capture unique and common features. Prompt-aware heads are utilized post-decoding to prevent information forgetting.

Result: DpDNet demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art models on a dataset with four cancer types. The resulting segmentations enabled calculations for breast cancer survival metrics like MTV, TLG, and SUVmax.

Conclusion: DpDNet is a promising tool for personalized risk stratification in cancer treatment, offering better segmentation results and aiding clinicians in improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and
variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic
signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as
a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different
cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers
in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,
we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific
prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared
knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early
introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to
adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset
with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax
for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the
potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification,
supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving
outcomes. Code is available at https://github.com/XinglongLiang08/DpDNet.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to accurately segment carotid artery vessel walls and plaques from multi-sequence MRI data, addressing challenges like limited labeled data and complex morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise analysis of carotid plaques in multi-sequence MRI is crucial for atherosclerosis and stroke risk assessment, but challenges arise due to the plaques' complex morphology and a lack of labeled data.

Method: The approach uses two networks: a coarse localization model for identifying regions of interest and a fine segmentation model for vessel wall/plaques. Multi-level U-Net architecture and fusion strategies are introduced, alongside semi-supervised learning to address data scarcity.

Result: The approach was evaluated on MRI data from 52 patients with arteriosclerosis and demonstrated effectiveness in achieving accurate segmentation, with expert-based validation confirming performance.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the effectiveness of multi-sequence data fusion and semi-supervised learning strategies for improving carotid artery segmentation in MRI, even with limited labeled data.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Motivation: The study is driven by the need for efficient storage solutions due to the increasing volume of data from advancements in imaging technologies.

Method: It employs two network architectures, D-CNN and VQ-VAE, with varying compression rates to process imaging data from a sandstone sample, introducing an edge-sensitive quality metric for evaluation.

Result: It finds that different architectures and compression rates are suitable based on the specific features to preserve in the data, providing comparative insights into decoding quality for different use cases.

Conclusion: The research offers guidance for scientists in determining optimal compression strategies and requirements tailored to their data storage and analysis needs.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

### [354] [Compressive Imaging Reconstruction via Tensor Decomposed Multi-Resolution Grid Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07707)
*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel unsupervised framework called GridTD for improving compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction tasks such as SCI and MRI. GridTD utilizes tensor decomposition and multi-resolution hash grid encoding for efficient, accurate recovery of high-dimensional images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised CI reconstruction methods face limitations in achieving a balance between representation ability and model efficiency, motivating the proposal of an advanced framework.

Method: GridTD is a framework combining tensor decomposition and multi-resolution hash grid encoding, optimized with a lightweight neural network for hierarchical and compact image modeling.

Result: GridTD achieves superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI reconstruction, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GridTD is established as a state-of-the-art and highly versatile method for CI reconstruction, backed by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

*Haoyu Pan,Hongxin Lin,Zetian Feng,Chuxuan Lin,Junyang Mo,Chu Zhang,Zijian Wu,Yi Wang,Qingqing Zheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for generating realistic breast ultrasound images to address the challenge of limited annotated data for training deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of expert-annotated breast ultrasound images for training robust deep learning models.

Method: A clinically controllable generative framework combining clinical descriptions and structural masks to create synthetic BUS images with realistic tumor characteristics.

Result: The synthetic images significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis tasks and are validated for realism by experienced sonographers.

Conclusion: This framework has strong potential for broader clinical applications in improving diagnostic capabilities in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework leveraging multimodal data for enhanced recurrence prediction in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate recurrence prediction in ccRCC remains challenging due to its molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity, and single-modality models prove insufficient.

Method: The study integrates multimodal data (CT, MRI, histopathology, clinical, genomic) using domain-specific models like ResNet50 (CLAM), 3D-ResNet18 (MeD-3D), and an MLP, with early and late data fusion strategies.

Result: The model successfully extracts and fuses deep feature embeddings from diverse modalities, improving prediction capabilities and handling incomplete data effectively.

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning frameworks can significantly enhance recurrence prediction accuracy and are valuable for clinical decision-making in heterogeneous diseases like ccRCC.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel semi-supervised MATLAB-based toolbox, ArteryX, for quantifying cerebral vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency, addressing limitations in existing MRA feature extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly impacts neurological health, requiring advanced tools to accurately assess vascular integrity and detect subtle vascular changes overlooked in clinical evaluations.

Method: ArteryX uses a vessel-fused network-based approach for artery landmarking and tracing, ensuring reliable quantification and validating results through in-vivo-like artery simulations with ground-truth features.

Result: Tested on subjects with cerebral small vessel disease, ArteryX demonstrated improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and outperformed existing semi-automated methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: ArteryX holds promise for enhancing clinical workflows, enabling early detection of vascular diseases, standardizing comparisons across cohorts, and advancing the study of cerebrovascular contributions to brain health.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

*Youssef ElTantawy,Alexia Karantana,Xin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on wrist bone segmentation in X-ray images using simulated X-ray data derived from CT scans to address the challenge of limited annotated datasets. The method achieved high performance in both simulated and real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray image segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis but requires substantial annotated data, which is challenging, especially for wrist bones due to their complexity.

Method: The researchers generated simulated X-ray images from CT volumes with labeled wrist bones and trained a deep learning model on these simulated datasets for real X-ray application.

Result: The model achieved Dice scores of 0.80 to 0.92 on simulated datasets and demonstrated strong qualitative segmentation on real X-rays.

Conclusion: Utilizing simulated X-rays from CT scans, the method effectively reduces reliance on annotated datasets, offering a scalable solution for wrist bone segmentation in clinical applications.

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis
(e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image
segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,
yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior
performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large
amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an
annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of
expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in
X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.
To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of
simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with
their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for
wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated
using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores
ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different
view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray
images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The
trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research
purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a label-efficient method for chest X-ray diagnosis using CLIP's pre-trained model, achieving significant AUC improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of acquiring large labeled datasets for medical imaging, mimicking real-world hospital constraints.

Method: The NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset is used with a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model, adapting it via partial fine-tuning and evaluating using zero-shot and few-shot learning.

Result: CLIP's features improved diagnosis performance by achieving over a 20% gain in mean AUC scores in few-shot tasks compared to the zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for medical imaging tasks under label constraints, potentially aiding in both common and rare disease diagnosis workflows.

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on
large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to
privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a
label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to
reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest
X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via
partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot
and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests
demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively
adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in
mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this
work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image
archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and
scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this
research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not
been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in imaging system evaluation using IDEAL and proposes IDEAL-IO, which reduces computational challenges and improves optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance imaging system design by addressing computational and optimization issues in current IDEAL methodology.

Method: IDEAL-IO interchanges density estimation and optical optimization to reduce memory and runtime, using more expressive models for efficiency.

Result: Runtime and memory usage were reduced by up to 6x, supporting better designs in diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy.

Conclusion: IDEAL-IO improves scalability and practicality for information-theoretic imaging system design across diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through
the information content of their measurements alone, enabling
application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding
challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed
to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL
across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,
long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to
end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with
Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density
estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting
models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed
models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory
usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide
optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive
optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing
information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for
real-world imaging system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations in approximating polytopes using computational models involving Minkowski sums and convex hulls.

Method: Analyzing polytopes using depth-specific approximation techniques and characterizing simplices as 'outer additive' convex bodies.

Result: Key finding is that simplices cannot be effectively approximated ('trivially approximated') in this computational model.

Conclusion: Simplices represent a unique case in polytopal approximations, as they are 'outer additive' and challenging to approximate effectively.

Abstract: We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing
polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we
study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given
depth. Our main results imply that simplices can only be ``trivially

Conclusion: Integrated machine learning approaches can significantly enhance research efficiency in chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly
expanding volume of requisite knowledge and experimental workload, provide
unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in
accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large
language models (LLMs) for automated literature reviews, and (2) the training

constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and
other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports),
effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the
autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the
CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g.,

Motivation: To enhance immersive entertainment by advancing generative AI models for spatial audio, extending existing Ambisonics formats.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end generative AI model called SonicMotion with two variations based on input precision, and introduces a simulated spatial audio-caption dataset.

Result: SonicMotion demonstrates strong semantic alignment, audio quality, and effectively captures spatial attributes in evaluations.

Conclusion: SonicMotion shows promise in advancing spatial audio generation technologies, offering high-quality immersive 3D soundscapes.

Abstract: Spatial audio is an integral part of immersive entertainment, such as VR/AR,
and has seen increasing popularity in cinema and music as well. The most common
format of spatial audio is described as first-order Ambisonics (FOA). We seek
to extend recent advancements in FOA generative AI models to enable the
generation of 3D scenes with dynamic sound sources. Our proposed end-to-end
model, SonicMotion, comes in two variations which vary in their user input and
level of precision in sound source localization. In addition to our model, we
also present a new dataset of simulated spatial audio-caption pairs. Evaluation

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for dynamic layer dropping in foundation speech models to optimize computation for edge and IoT devices, leveraging input-driven strategies with lightweight selectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for speech processing require dynamic architectures to adapt to computational limitations in edge and IoT environments. Existing layer-dropping techniques face drawbacks, including poorly optimized layer selection or significant architectural modifications.

Method: The paper proposes an input-driven layer-dropping approach that uses input features and a lightweight layer-selecting network to determine the best combination of layers to process during inference.

Result: Experiments on four public benchmarks and two pre-trained models show that the proposed method outperforms random dropping and achieves comparable or better results than early-exit strategies.

Conclusion: The input-driven layer-dropping method effectively converts static into dynamic networks for speech applications, maintaining strong performance while optimizing computational resource usage.

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where
computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures
featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer
dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone
network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows
transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches
exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly
modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven
$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight
layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing
layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks,
using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and
producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.

TL;DR: This paper presents a post-hoc framework called "Re-Bottleneck," which modifies the latent space of pre-trained neural audio models for improved performance in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural audio models often focus on reconstruction fidelity, neglecting tailored latent structure needed for specific downstream applications.

Method: The authors introduce "Re-Bottleneck," a framework that inserts an inner bottleneck trained with latent space losses to enforce user-defined structure in pre-trained autoencoders.

Result: The framework achieves three key outcomes: ordered latent channels without quality loss, semantic embedding alignment for improved downstream tasks, and equivariance for consistent transformations.

Conclusion: Re-Bottleneck is a flexible and efficient method for customizing audio model latents, enabling better adaptation to varied applications with minimal retraining.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of deploying ASR models on edge devices with limited memory, compute, and power, by evaluating the performance of advanced quantization methods.

Method: A comprehensive evaluation of eight state-of-the-art PTQ methods is conducted on two ASR model families, Whisper and Moonshine, across diverse datasets using an extended LLM compression toolkit.

Result: The study shows that 3-bit quantization can succeed on high capacity ASR models without retraining, balancing between efficiency and accuracy when using advanced PTQ techniques.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical insights for effectively optimizing ASR models for low-power and edge-device deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live
transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on
resource constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents
substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power.
Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an
effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining.
Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced
quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.
In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art
(SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and
Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,
memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR
leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on
both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression
toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced
quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline,
and detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even 3-bit quantization can succeed
on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating information from large and diverse datasets to improve parameter estimation, especially in applications like heterogeneous treatment effects.

Method: The paper proposes a two-step late fusion framework with semiparametric modeling: (1) compute initial estimators via individual task learning; (2) adaptively aggregate them while avoiding direct data sharing. It also includes a novel method for estimating nuisance parameters across tasks.

Result: The method provides faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning when tasks share parametric components. Simulations and real-world datasets validate its theoretical findings and demonstrate its efficacy in moderate sample sizes.

Conclusion: This multi-task learning framework improves parameter estimation in heterogeneous data sources, maintains data privacy, and performs effectively even in moderate samples, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: In the age of large and heterogeneous datasets, the integration of
information from diverse sources is essential to improve parameter estimation.
Multi-task learning offers a powerful approach by enabling simultaneous
learning across related tasks. In this work, we introduce a late fusion
framework for multi-task learning with semiparametric models that involve
infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, focusing on applications such as
heterogeneous treatment effect estimation across multiple data sources,
including electronic health records from different hospitals or clinical trial
data. Our framework is two-step: first, initial double machine-learning
estimators are obtained through individual task learning; second, these
estimators are adaptively aggregated to exploit task similarities while
remaining robust to task-specific differences. In particular, the framework
avoids individual level data sharing, preserving privacy. Additionally, we
propose a novel multi-task learning method for nuisance parameter estimation,
which further enhances parameter estimation when nuisance parameters exhibit
similarity across tasks. We establish theoretical guarantees for the method,
demonstrating faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning
when tasks share similar parametric components. Extensive simulations and real
data applications complement the theoretical findings of our work while
highlight the effectiveness of our framework even in moderate sample sizes.

### [368] [Robust signal decompositions on the circle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07007)
*Aral Kose,Daniel Liberzon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of decomposing piecewise constant functions on a circle using indicator functions of circular disks. It introduces the concept of robustness and degrees of freedom to prioritize desirable decompositions and provides a method to characterize and generate robust decompositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to help an agent on a circle sense its proximity to unknown landmarks, facilitating tasks like motion planning and obstacle avoidance by estimating the landmarks' number and locations.

Method: The authors use notions of robustness and degrees of freedom to identify desirable decompositions. They also characterize robust decompositions and propose a procedure to generate them.

Result: The paper provides a way to compute the number of possible robust decompositions of a function and derives bounds for those maximizing degrees of freedom when robustness is assured.

Conclusion: The study offers a systematic approach for decomposing piecewise constant functions into circular disk indicators under non-precise data, aiding landmark detection and control tasks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a piecewise constant function on the
circle into a sum of indicator functions of closed circular disks in the plane,
whose number and location are not a priori known. This represents a situation
where an agent moving on the circle is able to sense its proximity to some
landmarks, and the goal is to estimate the number of these landmarks and their
possible locations -- which can in turn enable control tasks such as motion
planning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the exact values of the function at
its discontinuities (which correspond to disk boundaries for the individual
indicator functions) are not assumed to be known to the agent. We introduce
suitable notions of robustness and degrees of freedom to single out those
decompositions that are more desirable, or more likely, given this non-precise
data collected by the agent. We provide a characterization of robust
decompositions and give a procedure for generating all such decompositions.
When the given function admits a robust decomposition, we compute the number of
possible robust decompositions and derive bounds for the number of
decompositions maximizing the degrees of freedom.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the convergence properties of SGD and SHB is crucial for designing efficient algorithms in stochastic optimization.

Method: Utilizes discrete Gronwall's inequality and analyzes SGD and SHB performance under different objective gradient conditions and step size schedules.

Result: Recovered convergence rates for SGD and SHB, showing almost sure results for non-convex and convex objectives and establishing bounds for SHB with constant momentum parameters.

Conclusion: The approach sheds light on convergence behavior using alternative mathematical tools, providing valuable insights into optimization methods.

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric
setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose
gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality
without Robbins-Siegmund theorem nor martingale convergence theory, we recover
results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$
for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot
\max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s)
- F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved
that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a
convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2
\frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and
$\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in
(\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.

### [370] [Multilayer GNN for Predictive Maintenance and Clustering in Power Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07298)
*Muhammad Kazim,Harun Pirim,Chau Le,Trung Le,Om Prakash Yadav*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to improve predictive maintenance (PdM) for power grids, achieving better performance and facilitating resilience-based substation clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current predictive maintenance models fail to account for spatial, temporal, and causal dependencies, leading to significant economic losses from power outages.

Method: The framework combines Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks (temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), integrated via attention-weighted embeddings to analyze grid incident data.

Result: The model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935, outperforming standard machine learning models and single-layer GNNs. Additionally, it identifies risk-based substation clusters with superior performance metrics over traditional clustering methods.

Conclusion: The multilayer GNN enhances failure prediction and facilitates risk-aware substation clustering, enabling proactive and effective grid management.

Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually,
partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial,
temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a
multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable
resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from
Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework
integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks
(temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through
attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935
+/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and
single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops
performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering
on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The
highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and
602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62
incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster
separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a
Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports
proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware
substation clustering.
