### [1] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reorganize hierarchies for better hyperbolic embeddings, achieving improved results across diverse metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic embeddings work well for hierarchical data, but optimal embeddings depend on the structure of the input hierarchy. This paper aims to explore whether LLMs can restructure these hierarchies to improve embedding quality.

Method: A prompt-based approach using LLMs guides the transformation of existing hierarchies, following desiderata for ideal hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments are conducted on 16 hierarchies.

Result: LLM-restructured hierarchies produced higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings compared to the original structures, evaluated using multiple embedding quality metrics.

Conclusion: Using LLMs to restructure hierarchies enhances hyperbolic embeddings and allows for explainable and justified reorganizations useful for knowledge engineers.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AssurAI, a Korean multimodal dataset designed for evaluating the safety of generative AI in a socio-culturally specific context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety datasets are focused on English and fail to address socio-cultural risks, including those specific to the Korean context and multimodal safety.

Method: The authors create a taxonomy of 35 AI risks, use expert-driven and crowdsourced methods to develop a large Korean multimodal dataset, and ensure data quality with measures like independent annotation and expert reviews.

Result: AssurAI includes 11,480 instances across multiple modalities (text, image, video, audio) and is validated in pilot studies for assessing risks in generative AI.

Conclusion: AssurAI is publicly released to support safer generative AI development tailored to the Korean socio-cultural environment.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

### [3] [$A^2Flow:$ Automating Agentic Workflow Generation via Self-Adaptive Abstraction Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20693)
*Mingming Zhao,Xiaokang Wei,Yuanqi Shao,Kaiwen Zhou,Lin Yang,Siwei Rao,Junhui Zhan,Zhitang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces $A^2Flow$, a framework for automated workflow generation utilizing self-adaptive abstraction operators, reducing reliance on manual operator predefinition and improving performance in general and embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for designing agentic workflows depend on manually predefined operators, hindering scalability and generalizability.

Method: $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: initial operator creation using LLMs, clustering for preliminary abstraction, and deep extraction to develop reusable execution operators. It also uses operator memory for enhanced decision-making.

Result: Experiments show $A^2Flow$ improves average performance by 2.4% and 19.3% on benchmarks, reducing resource usage by 37% compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: $A^2Flow$ successfully automates workflow generation with abstraction operators, outperforming baseline methods in efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [4] [Reasoning With a Star: A Heliophysics Dataset and Benchmark for Agentic Scientific Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20694)
*Kevin Lee,Russell Spiewak,James Walsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset and benchmarking approach for reasoning tasks in heliophysics, emphasizing deductive reasoning through coordinated workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language models to perform scientific reasoning in heliophysics, where reasoning often involves physical assumptions, unit consistency, and scientific formatting.

Method: The authors present the "Reasoning With a Star" dataset and utilize programmatic grading systems for benchmarking single-shot and multi-agent reasoning approaches.

Result: Multi-agent systems based on systems engineering principles performed better than direct prompting in deductive reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Coordinated workflows offer a promising strategy for tackling reasoning challenges in scientific domains like heliophysics.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Result: Applications include predictive tools for cardiac health, tumor progression tracking, optimized radiotherapy, and accelerated drug discovery.

Conclusion: Future advancements in multi-organ integration, genomics, and ethical frameworks will enable predictive, preventive, and personalized healthcare through digital twins.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

### [7] [Cross Domain Evaluation of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of different datasets into the Amazon CoT Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20701)
*Nitya Tiwari,Parv Maheshwari,Vidisha Agarwal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the generalizability of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning across diverse domains using datasets like A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and ChartQA, revealing varying effectiveness based on question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the generalization capability of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning outside the science domain and identify its potential limitations.

Method: The study employs a two-stage framework with rationale generation and answer inference, integrating vision features via a gated fusion mechanism into T5-based language models, subjecting systems to an ablation study.

Result: Findings show that vision features reduce hallucination in rationale generation, but commonsense reasoning remains a challenge, with performance varying significantly across question types.

Conclusion: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning offers practical insights but requires improvement for cross-domain generalization, particularly in commonsense reasoning areas.

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

### [8] [Learning Multi-Access Point Coordination in Agentic AI Wi-Fi with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20719)
*Yifan Fan,Le Liang,Peng Liu,Xiao Li,Ziyang Guo,Qiao Lan,Shi Jin,Wen Tong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative Agentic AI-driven framework for adapting Wi-Fi access points coordination dynamically in dense networking environments, surpassing current protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Wi-Fi coordination protocols fail to adapt to dynamic network conditions like interference and topology changes. The paper aims to overcome these limitations for future wireless networks.

Method: Each access point is represented as an autonomous large language model agent. These agents collaboratively reason, negotiate adaptive strategies, and interact in natural-language dialogue based on environmental feedback and past memory.

Result: Simulation results show the agentic AI framework outperforms current spatial reuse protocols, adapting effectively to diverse and dynamic network conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a promising intelligent and adaptable solution to optimize Wi-Fi coordination in next-gen networks, enhancing throughput and flexibility.

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

### [9] [OpenApps: Simulating Environment Variations to Measure UI-Agent Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20766)
*Karen Ullrich,Jingtong Su,Claudia Shi,Arjun Subramonian,Amir Bar,Ivan Evtimov,Nikolaos Tsilivis,Randall Balestriero,Julia Kempe,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenApps, an open-source ecosystem for testing the reliability of multimodal autonomous UI-Agents across varying app designs. Testing shows agent performance can vary drastically due to app variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a gap in evaluating the reliability of UI-Agents across varying app designs, as current methods only test agents in fixed environments which do not account for real-world app variability.

Method: The authors developed OpenApps, a lightweight ecosystem with six configurable apps, to create thousands of app variations. They conducted over 10,000 evaluations of seven multimodal agents to measure their reliability in different app environments.

Result: The study found significant performance fluctuations among agents when tested across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's success rate ranged from 63% to 4% depending on the app version. Agent behaviors also varied significantly with environment configurations.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to measure agent reliability across app variations to better understand and improve their adaptive performance. OpenApps provides a scalable framework to facilitate these evaluations.

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

### [10] [Representation Interventions Enable Lifelong Unstructured Knowledge Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20892)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RILKE is a scalable method for updating knowledge in LLMs by intervening in their representation space, enabling efficient and robust edits without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with updating their knowledge efficiently, especially for unstructured information, without retraining or causing interference with existing knowledge.

Method: RILKE uses representation interventions to learn paraphrase-robust, localized modules that process updates in a low-dimensional subspace, with a query-adaptive router for inference.

Result: RILKE demonstrates high success in editing, paraphrase generalization, and preservation of base model utility, with low memory demands, showing scalability on benchmarks.

Conclusion: RILKE provides a robust, resource-efficient method for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs, avoiding costly retraining while ensuring knowledge accuracy and coherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

### [11] [Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20934)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to compute optimal compositional explanations for neuron activations, addressing limitations of beam search methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand neuron activations in deep neural networks and assess their alignment with human concepts via logical rules, addressing the inefficiencies and suboptimality of current beam search methods.

Method: The authors develop a decomposition strategy, a heuristic for spatial alignment estimation during searches, and an efficient algorithm to compute guaranteed optimal explanations.

Result: In computer vision and CNN contexts, the authors found 10-40% of beam search explanations to be suboptimal with overlapping concepts, and their method offers improved accuracy and flexibility over prior techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework guarantees optimality in compositional explanations, highlighting inefficiencies in existing beam search approaches, while enhancing runtime and adaptability.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

### [12] [ENACT: Evaluating Embodied Cognition with World Modeling of Egocentric Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20937)
*Qineng Wang,Wenlong Huang,Yu Zhou,Hang Yin,Tianwei Bao,Jianwen Lyu,Weiyu Liu,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei,Manling Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ENACT, a benchmark to evaluate embodied cognition in vision-language models through egocentric interaction tasks in a visual question answering (VQA) format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether modern vision-language models, typically trained without embodied experience, demonstrate capabilities akin to embodied cognition, which arises from sensorimotor interactions.

Method: ENACT benchmark evaluates embodied cognition through two sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling and inverse world modeling, implemented as partially observable Markov decision processes. These tasks involve recognizing affordances, reasoning about action effects, and utilizing long-term memory based on egocentric input.

Result: Experiments on synthesized QA pairs revealed a performance gap between state-of-the-art vision-language models and humans, with models showing more success in inverse tasks. Models also showed anthropocentric biases and performance degradation with non-human-like inputs.

Conclusion: There is evidence of limited embodied cognition in current vision-language models, but substantial gaps remain compared to human performance, especially as task complexity increases.

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

*Rahul Dass,Thomas Bowlin,Zebing Li,Xiao Jin,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ivy, an AI coaching system that uses symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models combined with a generative layer to provide structured and causally driven instructional explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve AI-generated explanations for educational purposes, addressing the issue of large language models producing shallow or unstructured responses in procedural skill learning.

Method: The system integrates symbolic TMK models, encoding causal transitions and goal hierarchies, with a generative layer (LLM) to produce structured explanations. TMK guides the LLM to ensure explanations adhere to causal and goal-oriented structures.

Result: Ivy outperforms GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines, providing better structural quality in explanations, particularly for 'how' and 'why' questions as validated by expert and independent annotations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of combining symbolic constraints with generative models, enhancing the pedagogical quality of AI-generated explanations and presenting a scalable solution for intelligent coaching systems.

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

Motivation: Issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, unstable training, and entropy collapse prevent effective reasoning enhancements in LLMs using RLVR.

Method: The ICPO method calculates a preference advantage score based on relative generation probabilities for responses under the same input prompt, combining it with verifiable rewards to improve exploration and reasoning performance.

Result: Experiments show ICPO enhances reasoning capabilities consistently across general-domain and mathematical benchmarks compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: ICPO alleviates rewards-related issues, reduces overfitting, and facilitates better exploration, marking improvements in enhancing LLM reasoning through reinforcement learning techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

### [15] [Towards Trustworthy Legal AI through LLM Agents and Formal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21033)
*Linze Chen,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jinsong Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces L4M, a system that combines adversarial LLM agents and symbolic guarantees to ensure principled and rigorous legal decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based systems excel at text analysis but fail to meet the demands of principled and formal jurisprudence, creating a need for a system with both interpretive flexibility and logical rigor.

Method: L4M unites adversarial large language models (LLMs) with SMT-solver-backed proofs through three phases: formalizing statutes into logical formulae, independently mapping case facts and statutes, and logic-based adjudication to deliver a coherent and explainable verdict.

Result: The system outperforms advanced LLMs and state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines on public benchmarks, delivering superior outcomes with rigorous and transparent justifications.

Conclusion: The L4M framework validates that combining natural language flexibility with symbolic precision provides a robust and transparent approach to legal decision-making, filling gaps in both fairness and logical rationality.

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

*Chujie Wang,Jianyu Lu,Zhiyuan Luo,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OVOD-Agent, a novel approach to enhance Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) by incorporating proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OVOD methods, despite using large-scale vision-language datasets, are limited by fixed category names during inference, and the textual space remains underexplored for improving detection capabilities.

Method: The proposed OVOD-Agent leverages a Visual-Chain-of-Thought (Visual-CoT) paradigm extending textual optimization into interpretable visual reasoning. Detection dynamics are modeled as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP), employing a Bandit module for exploration and self-supervised reward models for optimizing detection policies.

Result: Experiments on COCO and LVIS datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in OVOD, particularly for rare categories, across various backbones using the OVOD-Agent framework.

Conclusion: The OVOD-Agent framework enhances OVOD performance by addressing the gap in textual space via proactive learning mechanisms, offering generalization ability to rare object categories.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Halpern and Pearl's causality definition is abstracted for broader application across diverse models and extensions beyond traditional causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the prominent definition of causality by Halpern and Pearl and apply it to scenarios and models involving complex logical structures, nested counterfactuals, and beliefs.

Method: The paper abstracts the Halpern-Pearl definition of causality, extracting its foundational components to make it applicable in non-traditional causal and explanation models.

Result: The abstracted causality definition is more versatile, working for different models including those with backtracking and complex logical formulations like nested counterfactuals, and it informs an abstract definition of explanation.

Conclusion: By abstracting causality, the paper enhances the utility and flexibility of causal reasoning models and provides deeper insights into causality and explanations.

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web is a novel web automation method using programmatic pruning to handle large DOM structures efficiently, significantly improving grounding task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating complex webpages with large DOM structures poses challenges for current LLM-based web agents, as DOM truncation risks losing critical information, and existing strategies fail to ensure precision and scalability.

Method: Prune4Web employs a paradigm where LLMs generate Python scripts to programmatically prune DOM elements based on semantic cues, avoiding the need to process large DOMs directly. Additionally, it integrates a tailored annotation pipeline and a dialogue-based training strategy for optimization.

Result: Prune4Web achieves 25x-50x reduction in elements for processing, enhances precision, and boosts grounding task accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%.

Conclusion: Prune4Web represents a significant advancement in web automation by efficiently combining pruning methods, lightweight programs, and specialized training strategies to improve accuracy and scalability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChatDRex, a multi-agent conversational system for efficient drug repurposing predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug repurposing offers significant advantages, but current computational tools are fragmented and inaccessible to non-experts.

Method: ChatDRex utilizes a natural language interface linked to a biomedical knowledge graph, employing specialized agents and reasoning modules for comprehensive data analysis.

Result: ChatDRex enables seamless bioinformatic workflow integration, hypothesis generation, and in silico drug validation for researchers and clinicians.

Conclusion: The system democratizes access to drug repurposing analysis, fostering advancements in personalized medicine and improving therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EWE, a novel intelligent agent framework for automated diagnostic reasoning in analyzing extreme weather events, addressing a critical gap in Earth science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical bottleneck in analyzing extreme weather events caused by the labor-intensive expert-driven diagnostic paradigms, and to develop an automated approach for such tasks.

Method: The method involves creating EWE, which uses knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a meteorological toolkit to autonomously analyze and interpret meteorological data for diagnostic purposes.

Result: The paper presents EWE and introduces a curated dataset with 103 high-impact events alongside a step-wise evaluation metric to benchmark progress in automated extreme weather analysis.

Conclusion: EWE demonstrates a step toward automated scientific discovery, offering a scalable way to enhance expertise, particularly benefiting developing nations prone to extreme weather events.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

*Junjian Wang,Lidan Zhao,Xi Sheryl Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment system, to enhance safety while maintaining performance for embodied AI agents in household task planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in real-world applications of embodied AI agents, especially in household settings, remains challenging due to high risks posed by unsafe instructions and limitations of existing methods.

Method: The MADRA framework employs a multi-agent debate strategy with logical scoring by a critical evaluator, iterative deliberations, and consensus voting. It also integrates hierarchical collaborative planning mechanisms for continuous learning.

Result: MADRA achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while minimizing rejection of safe tasks, outperforming existing methods in safety and task execution efficiency. Additionally, the SafeAware-VH benchmark dataset enhances safety-aware task planning evaluation.

Conclusion: MADRA offers a scalable, model-agnostic solution for improving the safety and reliability of embodied AI agents, particularly in household environments, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

### [23] [SpatialBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Spatial Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21471)
*Peiran Xu,Sudong Wang,Yao Zhu,Jianing Li,Yunjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialBench, a benchmark and framework to evaluate hierarchical spatial cognition in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across five levels of complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of spatial cognition, reducing it to overly simplistic metrics that do not reflect its hierarchical and interdependent nature.

Method: The authors developed a hierarchical framework dividing spatial cognition into five levels, created SpatialBench consisting of 15 aligned tasks, and proposed a unified metric for evaluation.

Result: The study found performance stratification among MLLMs, with strong perceptual grounding but limitations in advanced reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: This work provides the first structured approach for assessing hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs and aims to enhance their spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

*Yanxing Huang,Zihan Tang,Zejin Lin,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper enhances verification for math problems using 'pessimistic verification' by running parallel checks and improving performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in verification performance caused by error detection challenges in mathematical proofs.

Method: Introduces 'pessimistic verification,' which uses multiple parallel verifications for proofs and flags errors upon detection by any one verifier.

Result: The technique improves verification performance across benchmarks, is efficient in token and computational usage, and reveals annotation errors in datasets.

Conclusion: Pessimistic verification enhances mathematical problem-solving in language models, improving reliability and long-horizon task performance.

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

*Alex Diep*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study assesses AI self-transparency in professional personas and finds that self-disclosure of AI identity is inconsistent and context-dependent, with risks of misplaced user trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether AI language models can reliably self-disclose AI identity in high-stakes professional settings where trust in competence boundaries is critical.

Method: The study audited 16 open-weight language models (ranging from 4B to 671B parameters) across 19,200 trials, measuring transparency across different professional personas.

Result: Transparency in AI self-disclosure varied dramatically across domains and models, with some personas (e.g., Financial Advisor) eliciting higher disclosure rates than others (e.g., Neurosurgeon). Factors like model identity, rather than size, strongly predicted behavior, and reasoning optimization sometimes suppressed transparency.

Conclusion: Transparency is influenced by training design rather than scale, meaning organizations need intentional behavior design and empirical testing to ensure safe deployment in professional and high-stakes domains.

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining system dynamics and structural equation modeling into a unified framework for advancing responsible AI/ML by addressing methodological challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in responsible AI/ML caused by human biases and methodological assumptions, proposing richer causal models to improve AI/ML system design.

Method: It introduces a unified mathematical framework that combines system dynamics and structural equation modeling to facilitate generating systems, methods, and results analysis.

Result: This approach bridges methodological gaps, enabling better insights and consensus in the development of responsible AI/ML.

Conclusion: Integrating system dynamics and structural equation modeling offers a robust epistemological foundation, fostering better-informed strategies for responsible AI/ML development.

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'responsible computational foresight,' emphasizing the role of AI in ethical future planning and policymaking while ensuring human-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for ethical and sustainable approaches to navigate future uncertainties amidst rapid technological and global challenges through responsible foresight and computational modeling.

Method: The paper establishes principles of responsible computational foresight, explores AI's role in scenario analysis and simulations, and evaluates how these tools enhance policymaker capacities.

Result: AI-driven tools are identified as vital in aiding policymakers with uncertainty management, risk evaluation, and strategy formation while maintaining a focus on sustainability, ethics, and human-centric decisions.

Conclusion: AI can complement human decision-making for ethical, resilient, and sustainable future planning by enabling policymakers to handle 21st-century challenges effectively. Integration of AI in foresight practices should be done thoughtfully to uphold human and ethical values.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

### [28] [On the Limits of Innate Planning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21591)
*Charles Schepanowski,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study tests large language models (LLMs) on their planning and stateful reasoning abilities via the 8-puzzle game. Despite prompting techniques and corrective feedback, the models fail consistently in solving puzzles, showing significant limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to investigate the planning and reasoning capabilities of large language models, which remain unclear despite their success on various benchmarks.

Method: The authors tested four LLMs on the 8-puzzle task using multiple prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and tiered corrective feedback. Additionally, they employed an external move validator and performed qualitative analysis.

Result: Feedback and tools like move validators improved success rates in some cases, but the models failed to solve any puzzles under stricter conditions. Common issues observed include unstable state representations and weak planning heuristics.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit substantial deficiencies in planning and stateful reasoning without external tools. Progress in this area may require mechanisms like explicit state maintenance and structured search.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

TL;DR: ViLoMem enhances multimodal reasoning in MLLMs by integrating visual and logical error-aware memory to reduce repeated mistakes and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of memory limitations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and improve their ability to learn effectively from past experiences.

Method: Introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that encodes visual and logical reasoning patterns separately, enabling incremental refinement of schema-based semantic memory.

Result: ViLoMem improves pass@1 accuracy and reduces repeated errors across various benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Integrating dual-stream multimodal memory in MLLMs enables lifelong learning, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and aligns with human-like cognition for better cross-domain problem-solving.

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

### [30] [RISC-V Based TinyML Accelerator for Depthwise Separable Convolutions in Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21232)
*Muhammed Yildirim,Ozcan Ozturk*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hardware architecture to alleviate memory bottlenecks in executing lightweight CNNs for TinyML. It introduces 'fused pixel-wise dataflow' to eliminate intermediate memory buffer use and achieves significant energy, latency, and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The critical issue arises from high energy and latency costs in transferring intermediate feature maps during execution of lightweight CNNs in Edge AI applications. Current architectures struggle with the performance bottleneck induced by memory transfer requirements.

Method: The work proposes a novel hardware accelerator implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor. It employs fused pixel-wise dataflow, completing computation for single pixels across CNN layers without memory writes, and provides efficient streaming via tightly-coupled pipelines.

Result: Evaluation on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA demonstrates up to 59.3x speedup over baseline RISC-V software execution. ASIC synthesis indicates a compact footprint and power efficiency, making the design viable for TinyML applications.

Conclusion: This approach proves the feasibility of zero-buffer dataflow architecture, effectively addressing memory wall issues in TinyML and Edge AI applications. The design offers improved throughput and energy efficiency within resource constraints.

Abstract: The increasing demand for on-device intelligence in Edge AI and TinyML applications requires the efficient execution of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) to reduce computational complexity, their multi-stage design introduces a critical performance bottleneck inherent to layer-by-layer execution: the high energy and latency cost of transferring intermediate feature maps to either large on-chip buffers or off-chip DRAM. To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core. Furthermore, ASIC synthesis projects a compact 0.284 mm$^2$ footprint with 910 mW power at 2 GHz in 28 nm, and a 1.20 mm$^2$ footprint with 233 mW power at 300 MHz in 40 nm. This work confirms the feasibility of a zero-buffer dataflow within a TinyML resource envelope, offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming the memory wall in edge AI accelerators.

### [31] [Bombyx: OpenCilk Compilation for FPGA Hardware Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21346)
*Mohamed Shahawy,Julien de Castelnau,Paolo Ienne*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bombyx, a compiler toolchain for efficiently mapping task-level parallelism (TLP) programs from OpenCilk to FPGA spatial architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to efficiently execute TLP-based applications on FPGAs by aligning models with the hardware's streaming nature and overcoming challenges of context switching.

Method: Bombyx lowers OpenCilk programs to a Cilk-1-inspired intermediate representation and provides compilation targets for OpenCilk-compatible runtime and synthesizable PE generation using HLS tools.

Result: Bombyx introduces a decoupled access-execute optimization that improves memory-compute overlap and achieves higher throughput.

Conclusion: Bombyx effectively bridges the gap between CPU-oriented TLP programmability and FPGA architectures, demonstrating the potential for efficient high-performance implementations on FPGAs.

Abstract: Task-level parallelism (TLP) is a widely used approach in software where independent tasks are dynamically created and scheduled at runtime. Recent systems have explored architectural support for TLP on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), often leveraging high-level synthesis (HLS) to create processing elements (PEs). In this paper, we present Bombyx, a compiler toolchain that lowers OpenCilk programs into a Cilk-1-inspired intermediate representation, enabling efficient mapping of CPU-oriented TLP applications to spatial architectures on FPGAs. Unlike OpenCilk's implicit task model, which requires costly context switching in hardware, Cilk-1 adopts explicit continuation-passing - a model that better aligns with the streaming nature of FPGAs. Bombyx supports multiple compilation targets: one is an OpenCilk-compatible runtime for executing Cilk-1-style code using the OpenCilk backend, and another is a synthesizable PE generator designed for HLS tools like Vitis HLS. Additionally, we introduce a decoupled access-execute optimization that enables automatic generation of high-performance PEs, improving memory-compute overlap and overall throughput.

*Jason Yik,Walter Gallego Gomez,Andrew Cheng,Benedetto Leto,Alessandro Pierro,Noah Pacik-Nelson,Korneel Van den Berghe,Vittorio Fra,Andreea Danielescu,Gianvito Urgese,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper studies performance metrics and bottlenecks of neuromorphic accelerators, establishing a visual performance model and proposing an optimization methodology for improved runtime and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuromorphic accelerators have unique architectures that differ from conventional accelerators, yet existing workload optimization approaches do not sufficiently elucidate factors impacting their performance.

Method: The authors conducted a theoretical analysis and empirical characterization of three neuromorphic accelerators (Brainchip AKD1000, Synsense Speck, Intel Loihi 2), developed the floorline performance model, and proposed an optimization methodology combining sparsity-aware training and floorline-informed partitioning.

Result: Three bottleneck states (memory-bound, compute-bound, traffic-bound) were identified, alongside workload features influencing them. The optimization methodology achieved up to 3.86x runtime improvement and 3.38x energy reduction.

Conclusion: Conventional metrics for neuromorphic accelerators fall short in improving deployed performance; instead, the proposed floorline model and optimization methodology provide a practical framework for enhancing workload-specific outcomes.

Abstract: Neuromorphic accelerators offer promising platforms for machine learning (ML) inference by leveraging event-driven, spatially-expanded architectures that naturally exploit unstructured sparsity through co-located memory and compute. However, their unique architectural characteristics create performance dynamics that differ fundamentally from conventional accelerators. Existing workload optimization approaches for neuromorphic accelerators rely on aggregate network-wide sparsity and operation counting, but the extent to which these metrics actually improve deployed performance remains unknown. This paper presents the first comprehensive performance bound and bottleneck analysis of neuromorphic accelerators, revealing the shortcomings of the conventional metrics and offering an understanding of what facets matter for workload performance. We present both theoretical analytical modeling and extensive empirical characterization of three real neuromorphic accelerators: Brainchip AKD1000, Synsense Speck, and Intel Loihi 2. From these, we establish three distinct accelerator bottleneck states, memory-bound, compute-bound, and traffic-bound, and identify which workload configuration features are likely to exhibit these bottleneck states. We synthesize all of our insights into the floorline performance model, a visual model that identifies performance bounds and informs how to optimize a given workload, based on its position on the model. Finally, we present an optimization methodology that combines sparsity-aware training with floorline-informed partitioning. Our methodology achieves substantial performance improvements at iso-accuracy: up to 3.86x runtime improvement and 3.38x energy reduction compared to prior manually-tuned configurations.

### [35] [Democratizing LLM Efficiency: From Hyperscale Optimizations to Universal Deployability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20662)
*Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) require efficiency methods tailored for hyperscale providers, leaving smaller institutions disadvantaged. The paper proposes robust simplicity and new efficiency measures for broader LLM accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM efficiency methods benefit Big Tech with hyperscale capabilities, excluding smaller institutions and organizations.

Method: The researchers suggest retrofitting pretrained models, lightweight fine-tuning, economical reasoning methods, dynamic knowledge management alternatives to heavy RAG pipelines, and Overhead-Aware Efficiency benchmarks.

Result: Their approach aims for accessible LLM deployment, reducing inequality and environmental impacts.

Conclusion: Adopting robust and simple efficiency measures democratizes LLM usage while promoting sustainability and fairness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a deterministic and reversible method for text embeddings without training or stochastic parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional data-driven text embeddings.

Method: HTP encodes tokens analytically as harmonic trajectories derived from their Unicode representations, creating interpretable mappings for semantic evaluation.

Result: Experiments show HTP has strong semantic similarity performance (e.g., Spearman correlation of 0.68 on STS-B), stable across multiple languages with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: HTP demonstrates that deterministic and geometry-based embeddings can achieve meaningful semantic relations, offering a clear, efficient alternative to neural architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

### [37] [A centroid based framework for text classification in itsm environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20667)
*Hossein Mohanna,Ali Ait-Bachir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for classifying IT service tickets into hierarchical taxonomies using dual-embedding centroids, achieving high performance, efficiency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITSM systems require accurate and efficient classification of support tickets into hierarchical structures, which is challenging due to the need for performance and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose a dual-embedding centroid-based framework that uses separate semantic and lexical centroid representations for each category, fused using reciprocal rank fusion during inference.

Result: The framework performs comparably to Support Vector Machines while achieving 5.9x faster training, 152x faster incremental updates, and significant batch size speedups, tested on 8,968 ITSM tickets.

Conclusion: The method is highly efficient, interpretable, and well-suited for production settings in IT Service Management systems.

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

### [38] [PIRA: Preference-Oriented Instruction-Tuned Reward Models with Dual Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20668)
*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIRA, a new training paradigm to enhance reward models for Large Language Models (LLMs) by tackling data efficiency and reward overoptimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two major challenges in reward models for LLMs: low data efficiency due to direct concatenation of inputs, and vulnerability to reward overoptimization.

Method: PIRA employs three strategies: reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions, aggregating rewards from diverse tasks to reduce bias, and stabilizing reward estimation through averaged outputs under varied dropout rates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PIRA improves model effectiveness, reducing bias and reward instability while enhancing robustness.

Conclusion: PIRA provides a successful framework to overcome existing limitations in reward modeling for LLM alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

### [39] [Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20669)
*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance in legal tasks by structuring data, familiarizing them with legal terms, and emulating court reasoning based on rhetorical roles, achieving up to 4.36% F1 improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges faced by LLMs in specialized domains, particularly in law, where domain-specific knowledge and long, intricate legal texts demand unique solutions to boost processing and reasoning.

Method: The authors used three key techniques: reorganizing legal documents based on rhetorical roles, defining rhetorical roles to introduce legal terminology, and simulating court-like step-by-step reasoning with rhetorical roles. Experiments were conducted in a zero-shot setting on Indian legal judgment datasets.

Result: The methods led to significant improvements in LLM performance on legal tasks, resulting in an F1 score increase ranging from 1.5% to 4.36% over baseline results.

Conclusion: Structuring legal information and familiarizing LLMs with domain-specific terminology can meaningfully enhance their reasoning and performance on specialized legal tasks, overcoming domain knowledge gaps.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly,Daniel Wiechmann,Elma Kerz,Edward Kempa,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindSET, a new, extensive, and clean benchmark dataset for mental health analysis using social media data, especially Reddit, tackling limitations in existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of outdated benchmark datasets in mental health analysis caused by limited data availability, lack of preprocessing, and diverse nature of social media data.

Method: The authors curated the MindSET dataset with 13M annotated posts from Reddit, implemented preprocessing steps (such as language filtering, NSFW content removal), performed psychological linguistic analysis, and validated utilities through binary classification experiments.

Result: The dataset improves diagnosis detection models' performance, leading to up to an 18-point F1 score improvement for Autism detection compared to older benchmarks.

Conclusion: MindSET offers an enhanced resource for studying mental health through social media, enabling early detection of risks and a deeper understanding of psychological trends.

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Generative recommendation systems, though effective, often rely on uniform codebooks that inadequately address the imbalance between popular and long-tail items. FlexCode, a new framework, dynamically allocates token budgets to achieve better accuracy and tail robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in existing generative recommendation systems that fail to efficiently represent and generalize items with varied popularity levels.

Method: FlexCode allocates token budgets adaptively between collaborative filtering and semantic codebooks using a lightweight mixture of experts (MoE). It ensures coherence across item popularity through alignment and smoothness objectives.

Result: FlexCode achieves better accuracy and robustness for long-tail items, outperforming baseline methods on public and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: FlexCode demonstrates a novel and effective way to handle imbalances in item popularity within generative recommenders, improving both performance and generalization.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ar-SParC, the first Arabic dataset for context-dependent text-to-SQL task, evaluates different models and techniques, and proposes an improved method, GAT corrector, enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of datasets and research targeting the text-to-SQL task in the Arabic language, enabling users to interact with databases using natural language.

Method: The authors design the Ar-SParC dataset with 3,450 question sequences, conduct experiments using large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo), apply prompt engineering techniques, and introduce the GAT corrector approach.

Result: The GAT corrector improved execution accuracy by an average of 1.9% and interaction accuracy by 1.9% in zero-shot settings, and had increases of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX in in-context learning settings.

Conclusion: Ar-SParC contributes significantly by enabling the text-to-SQL task in Arabic, and the GAT corrector approach shows enhanced performance, particularly benefiting Arabic text interpretation in NLP models.

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights reasoning errors in GPT-4 when processing oncology notes, categorizing these errors in a new taxonomy to assess safety concerns. Flawed reasoning, including cognitive biases, impacted decision-making reliability, posing risks in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of large language models achieving high accuracy but exhibiting flawed reasoning in medical contexts, which poses safety risks for oncology decision support.

Method: A hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors was developed by analyzing chain-of-thought responses from GPT-4 on oncology notes. Errors were categorized using cognitive bias frameworks and validated across multiple datasets focusing on different cancer cases.

Result: Reasoning errors accounted for 23% of the analyzed cases and often led to harmful clinical recommendations. Automated evaluators detected the presence of errors but struggled to classify their subtypes.

Conclusion: While large language models demonstrate strong performance, their reasoning flaws make them clinically unsafe. The proposed taxonomy offers a framework to evaluate and improve reasoning before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [44] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), an adaptive approach to optimize response templates based on query complexity, reducing token usage and costs in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompting strategies for large language models are inefficient due to uniform verbose responses, resulting in higher token usage and costs.

Method: The authors propose DTS, combining adaptive routing with template selection informed by MLP embedding-based decisions or fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer models.

Result: The MLP router achieves a routing accuracy of 90.5%, outperforming RoBERTa, and reduces token usage by over 32% across three major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude).

Conclusion: Dynamic Template Selection effectively balances cost reduction and response quality, demonstrating robust cross-provider generalizability and efficiency in practical systems.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

### [46] [Memories Retrieved from Many Paths: A Multi-Prefix Framework for Robust Detection of Training Data Leakage in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20799)
*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, multi-prefix memorization, for identifying memorized sequences in large language models, emphasizing robustness through diverse retrieval paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and copyright concerns caused by the memorization of training data by large language models and shortcomings in existing definitions of memorization.

Method: The authors define multi-prefix memorization, where a sequence is considered memorized if external adversarial search finds enough distinct prefixes that retrieve it. They conducted experiments to test this on open-source and aligned chat models.

Result: The multi-prefix memorization framework reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized sequences and offers a practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Conclusion: This framework provides a more comprehensive and robust method for analyzing data memorization in large language models, improving privacy and copyright safeguards.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a framework to improve feature interpretation in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for large language models (LLMs). It adopts an iterative, agent-based approach and achieves better outcomes than current baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in the internal mechanisms of large language models and the challenge of explaining features extracted by sparse autoencoders.

Method: SAGE employs an agent-based framework that formulates multiple hypotheses for feature explanations, systematically tests these hypotheses, and iteratively refines them based on activation feedback.

Result: The proposed SAGE framework shows significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy in feature explanations compared to state-of-the-art baselines for sparse autoencoders across diverse LLMs.

Conclusion: SAGE provides a more effective, iterative methodology for interpreting SAEs, advancing the understanding of LLM internals and aiding in their safer deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining DSPy and HELM to improve LM benchmarking by using structured prompting methods. It highlights shortcomings of current benchmarks and shows that structured prompts produce more accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the issue of unrepresentative performance estimates caused by fixed prompts in existing language model benchmarks, which often fail to generalize across different LMs or estimate their achievable performance ceilings.

Method: The authors integrate DSPy's structured prompting methods with HELM and evaluate their approach using four prompting methods on four LMs across seven benchmarks. This includes the introduction of reasoning-based prompts (e.g., chain-of-thought).

Result: The study showed that the HELM framework with structured prompting improved performance estimation accuracy, reduced variability across benchmarks, corrected leaderboard misrepresentations, and made LMs less sensitive to prompt design.

Conclusion: Scalable estimation of performance ceilings, using structured and reasoning-based prompting, enables more accurate and decision-useful benchmarks. The authors also provide open-source tools for continued application and improvement.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

### [49] [Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20849)
*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tokenizer called Length-MAX that reduces token usage while improving training and inference efficiency in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of language models by reducing the number of tokens required for training and inference while maintaining or improving downstream performance.

Method: A novel tokenizer, Length-MAX, is proposed. It uses a length-weighted objective optimization formulated as a graph partitioning problem, solved with a greedy approximation algorithm.

Result: Length-MAX reduces tokens by 14–18% compared to Byte Pair Encoding. GPT-2 training steps are reduced by up to 18.5% and inference latency by up to 13.7%. It also improves downstream performance with a 16% throughput gain and lower perplexity and higher accuracy. Vocabulary coverage is 99.62% with a very low out-of-vocabulary rate.

Conclusion: Optimizing for average token length, rather than just token frequency, leads to more efficient and effective language modeling. Length-MAX is compatible with production systems and reduces memory usage during inference.

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies the need for dynamic, self-evolving memory in large language models (LLMs) to handle continuous tasks and introduces Evo-Memory, a benchmark for such evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory management in LLMs lacks dynamic, ongoing evolution, restricting their ability to adapt in real-world, long-term interactive scenarios.

Method: The authors propose Evo-Memory, a benchmark with sequential task streams requiring memory adaptation after each interaction, alongside representative memory modules and a baseline method, ExpRAG, and a new method, ReMem.

Result: Evaluations were conducted across 10 diverse datasets, unifying over ten memory modules. Newly proposed methods showed an ability to handle the continually evolving memory demands.

Conclusion: Evo-Memory demonstrates the significance of self-evolving memory frameworks, bridging the gap for LLMs to function in interactive and continual learning environments.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

*Ali Jahan,Masood Ghayoomi,Annette Hautli-Janisz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual approaches in argument mining for low-resource languages using three training scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multilingual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of argument mining for low-resource languages, leveraging cross-lingual approaches and overcoming data scarcity.

Method: Three scenarios were tested: zero-shot transfer (English data only), English training with LLM-generated examples, and cross-lingual blending of English and Persian data.

Result: The zero-shot model achieved F1 scores of ~50%. LLM augmentation improved results (~59% for English and ~69% for Persian). The cross-lingual model achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 74.8% on Persian data.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual models effectively address data scarcity and significantly improve argument mining in low-resource languages, surpassing LLM-based augmentation pipelines.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

Motivation: The motivation is to better understand the internal mechanisms by which large language models implement abstract semantic structures, an area that remains insufficiently characterized.

Method: The method integrates role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to analyze the implementation of semantic roles in LLMs.

Result: The study found highly concentrated circuits, gradual structural refinement without abrupt phase transitions, and moderate cross-model and cross-architecture conservation in the semantic grounding mechanisms of LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs form compact and causally isolated mechanisms to represent abstract semantic structure, with partial transferability across scales and architectures.

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

TL;DR: Chatty-KG is a modular conversational question-answering system that integrates large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graph (KG) querying for accurate, efficient, and multi-turn QA capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the limitations of existing conversational and KG-based QA systems, such as struggles with coreference, multi-turn context, and high latency, while combining LLM capabilities with KG-based factual grounding.

Method: Chatty-KG employs a multi-agent modular system where task-specific LLM agents collaborate to interpret dialogues, track context, link entities and relations, and generate SPARQL queries for structured query execution.

Result: Chatty-KG outperformed state-of-the-art systems in single-turn and multi-turn QA on diverse KGs, showcasing improved F1 and P@1 scores. It also demonstrated versatility by being compatible with both commercial and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: Chatty-KG offers a scalable, extensible, and reliable approach to multi-turn conversational QA over KGs, combining the adaptability of LLMs with structured KG querying for practical enterprise use cases.

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance of large language models (LLMs) on different linguistic queries and introduces a new dataset (RefoMed-EN) to evaluate their output characteristics. LLMs perform best on definition-type questions and struggle most with exemplification-type questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge that LLMs, while efficient at providing definitions, struggle with generating other types of answers like examples and paraphrases, a task that comes naturally to humans.

Method: The authors used TrackList, a linguistic and statistical pipeline, to analyze LLM performance on diverse queries. They introduced RefoMed-EN, a dataset containing annotations of 6170 medical terms with various answer types, and studied the effects of head (high frequency) vs. tail (low frequency) concepts using multiple evaluation metrics such as syntactic and semantic similarity, correlations, and embeddings.

Result: LLMs performed best on definition-type queries but poorly on exemplification-type ones. For definition tasks, LLMs were also shown to paraphrase more for high-frequency (head) concepts and less for rare (tail) and technical knowledge, particularly within expert texts.

Conclusion: LLMs show limitations in versatility, excelling in certain types of responses (definitions) while struggling in others (e.g., examples). Moreover, their performance is influenced by the frequency and familiarity of the concepts, revealing a bias towards high-frequency knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

TL;DR: The study explores whether in-context learning (ICL) can override pre-trained label semantics or merely refines them, using flipped label meanings in multiple tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether ICL can flexibly reinterpret classifiers' label meanings or if it relies heavily on pre-trained semantic structures.

Method: The behavior of LLMs under natural versus inverted demonstrations was analyzed using metrics like truth, prior, and prompt alignment, across eight tasks and LLMs with parameters ranging from 1 to 12 billion.

Result: The study found that ICL fails to override label semantics, retaining zero semantic override rates when label meanings are flipped. High prior alignment was observed, and modified label semantics only decreased accuracy.

Conclusion: ICL relies on stable pre-trained semantic structures and lacks flexibility to override label meanings in few-shot settings. Semantic remapping at these scales likely requires methods beyond ICL.

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

TL;DR: Detecting sarcasm is challenging for Natural Language Processing, even with advanced models. This paper enhances sarcasm detection using a retrieval-aware approach, integrating contextual information through non-parametric and self-knowledge retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing sarcasm detection methods in Pre-trained and Large Language Models, particularly their struggle with complex, context-dependent, and culturally varied text.

Method: The paper introduces a retrieval-aware pipeline combining non-parametric knowledge retrieval (web-based) and self-knowledge retrieval to provide context for sarcastic text analysis, particularly through Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP).

Result: The approach achieved a 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on the Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic dataset, and moderate improvements of 3.29% and 4.08% on SemEval-2018 Task 3 and MUStARD, respectively.

Conclusion: Providing contextual information, especially addressing cultural variations and slang, plays a vital role in sarcasm detection. Optimizing contextual retrieval is a key area for future research.

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In low-resource languages, fine-tuning pre-trained encoder weights is often avoided due to resource constraints, and MLPs face limitations in expressiveness and computational efficiency. The motivation is to explore more effective classification heads.

Method: The study introduces KANs (FourierKAN, EfficientKAN, FasterKAN) to replace MLPs as classification heads, conducting experiments on various embeddings such as TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers like mBERT and Distil-mBERT.

Result: EfficientKAN achieved the highest F1-score (0.928) using fastText. FasterKAN provided the best balance of speed and accuracy, while EfficientKAN performed comparably or better than MLPs on transformer embeddings like mBERT (F1-score 0.917).

Conclusion: KANs are demonstrated to be expressive and efficient alternatives to MLPs for classification tasks in low-resource languages, showcasing improved or competitive performance in terms of accuracy and speed.

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 28 configurations of three large language model families on word puzzles requiring character-level constraints, revealing performance differences primarily due to architectural features rather than scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well different large language models perform in satisfying hard orthographic constraints and analyze whether parameter scaling alone suffices for improved performance.

Method: 28 configurations across three language model families were tested on 58 word puzzles, analyzing the impact of architecture, parameter scaling, and thinking budget on F1 scores against human solver benchmarks.

Result: Architectural differences produced larger performance gaps than parameter scaling. High-capacity models showed F1 improvements while mid-sized models showed stagnation or degradation. Models also failed on orthographically atypical yet valid patterns.

Conclusion: Improvements in constraint satisfaction may require architectural innovations or specialized training objectives, as scaling parameters or compute alone is insufficient for certain challenges.

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

*Ye Bhone Lin,Thura Aung,Ye Kyaw Thu,Thazin Myint Oo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores error correction in Burmese ASR using Transformers with feature integrations like IPA and alignment data, showing notable accuracy improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in a low-resource language (Burmese) through effective error correction methods.

Method: Sequence-to-sequence Transformer models were employed, combining different features, including IPA and alignment information, to enhance ASR error correction.

Result: Error correction approaches improved ASR models' Word Error Rate (WER) from 51.56 to 39.82 without augmentation and enhanced chrF++ from 0.5864 to 0.627.

Conclusion: Feature-rich, sequence-based error correction models are effective for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings, emphasizing feature design's role for enhanced performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

### [60] [MortgageLLM: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining with Residual Instruction Transfer, Alignment Tuning, and Task-Specific Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21101)
*Manish Jain,Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam,Salman Faroz,Chandrakanth Lns,Vinay Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents MortgageLLM, a domain-specific LLM for mortgage finance, using a dual-track specialization framework to optimize both conversational and structured tasks, outperforming baseline models in domain-specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models generally perform well in general domains but struggle in specialized sectors, such as mortgage finance, due to the requirement for domain-specific knowledge without sacrificing general instruction-following abilities.

Method: The authors developed MortgageLLM using a dual-track specialization framework derived from a base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). The method includes creating two specialized models instead of one multi-task model to avoid performance trade-offs and employs an instruction residual technique to maintain instruction-following fidelity. Furthermore, an intelligent task routing mechanism is applied.

Result: The proposed model (MLM v2) significantly outperformed the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct in domain-specific benchmarks, achieving improved scores in summarization, Q&A, and classification tasks. Additionally, substantial improvements in semantic similarity metrics were also observed.

Conclusion: MortgageLLM effectively addresses the dual challenge of incorporating domain-specific knowledge and maintaining instruction-following capabilities, demonstrating its viability for domain-specific applications in mortgage finance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

*Yuhang Wang,Yanxu Zhu,Dongyuan Lu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGASA, a framework enhancing reasoning models' defense against adversarial jailbreak prompts while minimizing rejection of benign requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of reasoning models to adversarial jailbreak prompts that often bypass safety mechanisms and lead to harmful outputs.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage framework: Data Pre-synthesis for generating safety guidelines and augmented prompts, and Alignment Fine-tuning using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed safety guidelines into the model.

Result: Experiments show that SGASA significantly improves model safety across multiple datasets, making it more effective and scalable.

Conclusion: SGASA effectively enhances safety alignment in reasoning models, enabling them to better handle adversarial prompts without affecting benign request handling.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

### [62] [Can Finetuing LLMs on Small Human Samples Increase Heterogeneity, Alignment, and Belief-Action Coherence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21218)
*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates whether fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) on small human sample data can align better with human behavior in research scenarios, showing partial improvement but not fully replicating human inferential analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore if fine-tuning LLMs on a small subset of human data can address their misalignment with real human behavior in survey and experimental research contexts.

Method: A behavioral experiment was conducted on information disclosure, comparing human and LLM responses across dimensions like distribution divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and regression coefficient recovery.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on small human samples improved heterogeneity, subgroup alignment, and belief-action coherence, but they still failed to replicate the regression coefficients of human participants.

Conclusion: Although fine-tuning LLMs improves certain behavioral simulations, they remain inadequate as substitutes for human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

### [63] [Developing an Open Conversational Speech Corpus for the Isan Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21229)
*Adisai Na-Thalang,Chanakan Wittayasakpan,Kritsadha Phatcharoen,Supakit Buakaw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, focusing on natural and authentic linguistic phenomena and offering practical transcription protocols to address challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop resources and research support for the Isan language, which is underrepresented and lacks standardized orthography. This effort aims to advance inclusive AI development and linguistic study.

Method: A natural Isan conversational speech dataset was developed. Practical transcription protocols were created to address challenges like non-standard orthography, tonal variations, and linguistic authenticity while maintaining computational usability.

Result: The dataset for Isan conversational speech was successfully created and made open for use. Transcription guidelines were also designed to ensure accuracy and utility for computational processing.

Conclusion: Releasing the open dataset will facilitate inclusive AI advancements, promote research on underrepresented languages, and tackle linguistic challenges in modeling conversational speech.

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

*Robert Belanec,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Maria Bielikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEFT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods on large language models (LLMs), alongside a new evaluation metric, PSCP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational, environmental costs of LLMs and the reproducibility challenges in evaluating PEFT methods.

Method: Developed PEFT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark for PEFT methods evaluation, and proposed the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric.

Result: Evaluated 6 PEFT methods over 27 NLP datasets, showcasing the benchmark's utility and the impact of different PEFT training and inference factors.

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench and PSCP offer a comprehensive framework for assessing PEFT methods, balancing efficiency and performance in LLM tuning.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines Martin's Law in text generated by neural language models during training, finding a non-linear developmental trajectory and proposing a methodology to evaluate linguistic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how compliance with linguistic properties, specifically the relationship between word frequency and polysemy (Martin's Law), evolves in neural language models during training.

Method: Using DBSCAN clustering on contextualized embeddings, the researchers analyzed the progression of Martin's Law across 30 training checkpoints in four Pythia models ranging from 70M to 1B parameters.

Result: Findings show that Martin's Law emerges, peaks, and degrades during the training process, with smaller models showing catastrophic semantic collapse and larger models demonstrating graceful degradation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that linguistic compliance in language models does not continuously improve with training but follows an optimal balanced trajectory, introducing a methodology for studying linguistic structures in neural models.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

*Joshua Fonseca Rivera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores introspective awareness in language models, showing that fine-tuning can enable reliable detection and reporting of fleeting activation patterns, addressing AI transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and enhance introspection capability in language models to offer better AI transparency and address inconsistencies in cross-model behavior, as suggested by prior work.

Method: Fine-tuning is used on a 7B parameter model to enable detection and reporting of transient single-token injections, improving accuracy from 0.4% to 85% while eliminating false positives.

Result: The trained model demonstrates improved detection of fleeting activation patterns, retains information, and semantically reports injected thoughts with high accuracy, generalizing to unseen concept vectors.

Conclusion: Training can induce introspective behaviors, satisfying criteria like accuracy and grounding, and offers a pathway for AI transparency without establishing metacognitive representation.

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Antonín Jarolím,Martin Fajčík,Lucia Makaiová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of extracting fine-grained evidence for Czech and Slovak claims in user comments to detect misinformation, introducing a new dataset and evaluating various large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation often spreads in user comments under online news articles, necessitating methods to identify and validate factually incorrect information effectively by pinpointing supporting or refuting evidence.

Method: The authors created a new dataset with fine-grained evidence annotated by paid annotators. Various large language models (LLMs) were evaluated on this dataset for their ability to align with human annotations.

Result: LLMs tend to struggle in copying evidence verbatim, causing errors. However, llama3.1:8b performed surprisingly well given its size. Models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b showed a good balance of model efficiency and accuracy, while gpt-oss-120b underperformed despite its large parameter count.

Conclusion: Fine-grained evidence extraction for misinformation detection remains a challenge for LLMs, but some smaller models demonstrated promising efficiency. The results highlight the need for further improvement in alignment with human annotations and extraction tasks.

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

*Zhifeng Hao,Qibin Song,Ruichu Cai,Boyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSR-SQL, a new framework to improve Text-to-SQL reasoning in complex databases by addressing issues like context capacity and schema linking. It has competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods struggle with coherent reasoning in complex enterprise databases due to limitations in context capacity, schema linking, and grounding in database semantics.

Method: DSR-SQL uses a Dual-State Reasoning framework with an adaptive context state for environment refinement and a progressive generation state for feedback-guided SQL synthesis.

Result: DSR-SQL achieves 35.28% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32% on the BIRD development set without requiring post-training or in-context examples.

Conclusion: DSR-SQL demonstrates competitive performance and enhances reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL tasks for complex databases, offering a potential advancement for enterprise database querying.

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Odin, a novel model integrating graph structure into Transformers using an oriented dual-module mechanism, and introduces a lightweight variant, Light Odin, for effective and efficient text-rich graph analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of GNNs in over-smoothing and Transformer-based approaches in ignoring graph topology while working with text-attributed graphs.

Method: Introduced Odin, an architecture integrating graph structure into Transformers at specific layers without relying on multi-hop diffusion, and a lightweight variant, Light Odin, for lower computational cost.

Result: Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several text-rich graph benchmarks, and Light Odin balances competitive performance with reduced resource demands.

Conclusion: Odin and its lightweight variant, Light Odin, offer an efficient, scalable framework for text and structural data integration, surpassing existing models in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates six state-of-the-art model merging methods for large language models (LLMs), concluding that only the basic Task Arithmetic method achieves consistent gains while others cause performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether advantages of model merging methods, especially seen in smaller models, generalize to large language models (LLMs).

Method: The research systematically assesses six merging methods across multiple LLMs, fine-tuned checkpoints, and standardized benchmarks.

Result: Task Arithmetic is the only method delivering reliable performance improvements, while interference-aware and subspace methods often lead to degradation.

Conclusion: Current model merging methods are unsuitable for LLMs, necessitating development of LLM-specific algorithms and improved fine-tuning techniques.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bidirectional mechanism for text readability assessment, considering sentence-level predictions and ordinal label relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for readability assessment often overlook text length and ordinal label relationships.

Method: A bidirectional mechanism predicts sentence-level readability, assists document-level prediction, and incorporates a pairwise sorting algorithm for ordinal labels.

Result: The method achieved competitive and superior performance compared to baselines on English and Chinese datasets.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates a robust model for readability assessment that incorporates contextual and ordinal label relationships.

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses modality-specific bias in speech-to-text translation systems, particularly how they assign gender to speakers using language nuances and acoustic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the biases in speech translation models, which can misgender speakers when translating into gendered languages due to acoustic information and inherent biases.

Method: The study analyzes gender assignment mechanisms in speech translation systems across three language pairs (English-Spanish/French/Italian) by examining training data biases, internal language model biases, and acoustic information. Techniques like contrastive feature attribution are used.

Result: The models analyze broader masculine prevalence patterns and override internal biases using acoustic cues. High gender accuracy models utilize first-person pronouns and access distributed frequency spectrum information rather than focusing on pitch alone.

Conclusion: Speech translation models exhibit biases but can overcome them through distributed acoustic information utilization. This has implications for improving gender accuracy in translation tasks and addressing misgendering issues.

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

### [74] [RoParQ: Paraphrase-Aware Alignment of Large Language Models Towards Robustness to Paraphrased Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21568)
*Minjoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoParQ, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' consistency with paraphrased questions, and XParaCon, a metric to measure robustness. Experiments show fine-tuning improves semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the inconsistency in LLMs' responses to paraphrased questions, which often indicate a reliance on patterns rather than understanding semantics.

Method: RoParQ is a benchmark created by paraphrasing questions using proprietary models and filtering ambiguous examples. XParaCon is proposed as a metric for measuring robustness. The study also developed a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy to improve semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that fine-tuning significantly improved consistency, even in smaller models, achieving performance levels comparable to larger pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively improve the robustness and semantic understanding of LLMs, reducing their dependence on superficial patterns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

*Yixiu Zhao,Xiaozhi Wang,Zijun Yao,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to isolate and identify skill-related neurons in large language models, allowing for the detection of task-specific behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the opaque internal mechanisms of large language models by focusing on specific neurons encoding specialized skills.

Method: The method involves correlating neuron activations with auxiliary metrics like external labels and model confidence scores to uncover interpretable behaviors without manual token aggregation.

Result: The proposed method effectively detects neurons tied to specific tasks like text generation and inference, revealing known skills and shortcuts in reasoning, validated on BigBench.

Conclusion: By isolating skill-related neurons, this research advances the understanding of LLM functionalities, uncovering both expected and new behaviors in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

### [76] [Beyond URLs: Metadata Diversity and Position for Efficient LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21613)
*Dongyang Fan,Diba Hashemi,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of various metadata types, beyond URLs, to accelerate pretraining of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify whether varied metadata types beyond URLs can enhance pretraining efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs.

Method: The study employs extensive probing and introduces metadata appending as an auxiliary learning task, leveraging fine-grained metadata indicators.

Result: The research discovers that finer-granularity metadata accelerates pretraining, and appending predictive tasks for metadata further enhances efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating fine-tuned metadata and appending predictive auxiliary tasks serve as effective strategies to optimize pretraining outcomes for LLMs.

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

### [77] [The author is dead, but what if they never lived? A reception experiment on Czech AI- and human-authored poetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21629)
*Anna Marklová,Ondřej Vinš,Martina Vokáčová,Jiří Milička*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper finds that Czech native speakers perceive AI-generated and human-written poetry similarly, often misattributing authorship, and their aesthetic evaluation is strongly influenced by perceived authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how AI-produced creative texts are perceived in non-English, low-resource languages like Czech, investigating AI's capability in poetry and its reception among native speakers.

Method: The study involved Czech speakers identifying authorship of AI- and human-written poems and rating their aesthetic appeal, using logistic regression to analyze factors affecting accuracy and evaluations.

Result: Participants guessed authorship at chance levels (45.8% correct), showing AI-generated Czech poetry is indistinguishable from human-written counterparts. Aesthetic judgment revealed bias, with suspected AI origins resulting in lower ratings despite often equal or higher actual quality.

Conclusion: AI can generate high-quality poetry in complex, low-resource languages like Czech. Readers' perceptions of authorship heavily influence aesthetic evaluations, regardless of poetic merit or their literary familiarity.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Matrix,' a decentralized framework for synthetic data generation using multi-agent workflows without a central orchestrator, achieving significantly higher throughput and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of centralized or hardcoded frameworks in multi-agent synthetic data generation, which face bottlenecks and lack flexibility.

Method: Matrix, a peer-to-peer, decentralized framework using serialized message passing and distributed services, is built on Ray to handle tens of thousands of tasks independently and flexibly.

Result: Matrix demonstrated 2–15x higher data generation throughput in various scenarios under identical hardware resources, maintaining output quality.

Conclusion: Matrix enables scalable, adaptable, and efficient multi-agent data synthesis, addressing challenges in flexibility and scalability of previous systems.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolOrchestra, a system for training small orchestrators to manage intelligent tools, achieving efficiency and improved performance in challenging tasks like Humanity's Last Exam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and complexity of solving deep, agentic problems using large and computationally expensive models.

Method: The authors proposed ToolOrchestra, which trains orchestrators using reinforcement learning with rewards focused on outcomes, efficiency, and user preferences.

Result: ToolOrchestra's model Orchestrator outperformed GPT-5 in performance and efficiency across benchmarks, achieving high accuracy and user alignment at a lower cost.

Conclusion: Lightweight orchestration of diverse tools presents a scalable and effective approach for practical reasoning systems, outperforming current methods in both cost and performance.

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

### [80] [Revisiting Generalization Across Difficulty Levels: It's Not So Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21692)
*Yeganeh Kordi,Nihal V. Nayak,Max Zuo,Ilana Nguyen,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across tasks of varying difficulty by analyzing thousands of LLM outputs and emphasizes the need for diverse difficulty levels in datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform on tasks of varying difficulty for effective data curation and performance evaluation.

Method: Systematic evaluation using Item Response Theory (IRT) and outputs from thousands of LLMs to assess task difficulty objectively without relying on human opinion.

Result: Cross-difficulty generalization in LLMs is limited; training solely on easy or hard tasks does not ensure consistent performance across difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Diverse difficulty levels are essential for training and evaluating LLMs, as focusing narrowly on difficulty can lead to inconsistent outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

### [81] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy leakage in multi-modal models (MMs) with membership inference attacks (MIA) and proposes a neuroscience-inspired regularization framework to enhance their resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing use of multi-modal models (MMs), privacy risks such as sensitive training data leakage have emerged, necessitating the examination of mechanisms to enhance model resilience against such privacy threats.

Method: The study introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to reduce vulnerability of vision-language multi-modal models (VLMs) against privacy attacks while maintaining performance.

Result: The study demonstrates that NEURO VLMs (with tau > 0 configurations) achieve reduced susceptibility to MIA attacks (24% reduction in attack success measured by ROC-AUC) while maintaining utility, evaluated across multiple VLM architectures (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) and datasets (COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps).

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired regularization frameworks can significantly improve the resilience of multi-modal VLMs against privacy attacks with minimal trade-offs in utility, showcasing their potential for enhancing AI privacy.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Foundation Model Distillation (FMD)," a method for compressing large pre-trained foundation models into smaller and efficient proxies while maintaining their general-purpose capabilities. The implementation focuses on 3D point cloud data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying large foundation models on resource-constrained hardware like edge devices while preserving their general-purpose usability.

Method: The authors propose a novel distillation method where a smaller model (student) is trained using compressed SuperTokens that effectively reconstruct the larger model's (teacher's) latent representations, retaining its generality.

Result: A distilled model preserves strong performance across tasks like classification, segmentation, and few-shot learning with significantly reduced computational needs and size.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances efficiency and general-purpose capability, allowing resource-constrained deployment without significant performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

TL;DR: World models, enabled by semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding, generate immersive, interactive, and realistic long videos, with Inferix introduced as a next-generation inference engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance video generation and simulation capabilities, moving beyond LLM-centric vision models by introducing a more interactive and efficient approach to world modeling.

Method: Utilizing a semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm that combines diffusion and autoregressive strengths while enabling efficient and coherent video synthesis.

Result: Inferix provides an innovative inference engine for immersive simulations, integrating tools like interactive video streaming and LV-Bench for benchmarking minute-long videos.

Conclusion: Inferix represents a step forward in world modeling, offering efficient, high-quality, and realistic video simulation capabilities, encouraging community collaboration for advancement.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses a hybrid approach combining edge computation and local tracking for video object recognition on resource-constrained devices, introducing LTED-Ada for adaptive decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object recognition for resource-limited devices like traffic cameras is challenging due to computational constraints. The hybrid use of edge servers and local tracking offers potential but requires effective decision-making to switch between the two.

Method: Two optimization problems are formulated for single and multi-device scenarios. LTED-Ada, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, manages adaptive decisions based on frame rate, accuracy, and delay in single-device cases, while federated learning enhances multi-device cooperation.

Result: Through hardware-in-the-loop experiments on Raspberry Pi and edge servers, the LTED-Ada approach proves to be superior in adapting to dynamic scenarios and improving recognition accuracy and delay.

Conclusion: LTED-Ada effectively optimizes the trade-off between edge detection and local tracking in both single and multi-device setups, leveraging reinforcement and federated learning for adaptive, efficient video analytics in constrained environments.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

TL;DR: The study introduces DeeAD, an action-guided early-exit framework to accelerate Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving by terminating inference when lightweight planning priors are satisfied.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of significant inference latency in transformer-based Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving.

Method: DeeAD employs an early-exit mechanism that uses trajectory feasibility instead of confidence scores and a multi-hop controller to skip redundant layers adaptively, integrating with existing models without retraining.

Result: The approach achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity, 29% latency reduction, and maintains high planning quality and safety.

Conclusion: DeeAD is a training-free framework that improves the efficiency of VLA models, reducing latency while preserving performance and safety in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DinoLizer, a model based on DINOv2, for detecting manipulated regions in generative inpainting, achieving superior results over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively identify manipulated regions in generative inpainting amidst challenges like resizing, noise addition, and compression.

Method: A DINOv2 model is used with a linear classification head, a sliding-window approach, and post-processed aggregations for pinpointing semantic alterations in images.

Result: DinoLizer achieves an average 12% higher IoU compared to the next best model and shows robustness to various post-processing operations.

Conclusion: DinoLizer demonstrates the strength of Vision Transformers in manipulation detection, surpassing state-of-the-art models and ensuring accuracy across different testing conditions.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [87] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CANVAS, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of vision language models (VLMs) to perform tool-based user interface design tasks in software like Figma or Sketch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and enhance the collaborative potential of VLMs with designers in UI design software by creating a benchmark that evaluates their tool-based design performance.

Method: A benchmark (CANVAS) was developed with 598 tool-based design tasks from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories. VLMs perform two tasks: design replication and design modification, using context-based tool invocations linked to design software.

Result: Leading VLMs demonstrate better tool usage strategies, improving design quality. Identified common errors reveal areas for improvement in tool-based design capabilities.

Conclusion: CANVAS highlights VLMs' performance in UI design tasks and guides future research to improve their tool-based design abilities, emphasizing their potential in assisting designers.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which enhances image representations using input text queries, improving vision-language model (VLM) performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard approach for image encoders in VLMs results in models that do not adapt image processing based on specific text queries or downstream tasks.

Method: The authors propose TIE, an encoder that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries and train VLMs with this approach.

Result: TIE-equipped VLMs achieve +1.5 and +1.3 points improvement on average across benchmarks at 1B and 3B scales, and notable efficiency in inference with fewer image tiles.

Conclusion: Text-conditioned training, as demonstrated with TIE, improves task-specific relevance, inference efficiency, and interpretability of VLMs.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMARC, a model for reconstructing and classifying material surfaces from sparse visual input (only 10% of the image).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve material surface understanding in robotics or perception applications under partial or constrained visual data.

Method: Combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net for spatial inpainting with a classification head, enabling simultaneous reconstruction and classification from sparse image data.

Result: SMARC outperformed five models with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and 85.10% classification accuracy on the Touch and Go dataset.

Conclusion: Partial convolution effectively handles missing data and establishes SMARC as a robust choice for minimal-vision surface understanding.

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is a framework to enhance reasoning with long videos through multimodal chain-of-tool-thought. It outperforms previous methods in understanding and analyzing dispersed video evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in large multimodal models for long video reasoning and improve comprehension through global-to-local video analysis.

Method: LongVT employs interleaved multimodal chain-of-tool-thought reasoning, leveraging LMMs for temporal grounding to zoom into specific video clips and resample finer video frames iteratively.

Result: LongVT achieves superior performance across four challenging benchmarks for long-video understanding and reasoning, supported by thorough validation and a new curated dataset named VideoSIAH.

Conclusion: LongVT offers a robust approach for reasoning with lengthy video content, addressing gaps in prior methods and ensuring results are grounded in visual evidence, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reexamines the KRISP model, presenting a lightweight alternative with fewer parameters for vision-language reasoning, revealing design flaws and benefits in constrained setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of the original KRISP model, which limits its scalability and usage on resource-restricted devices.

Method: The authors replicated KRISP with fewer parameters, conducted ablation studies on synthetic and real-world datasets, and constrained the model's reliance on external knowledge graphs.

Result: The replicated model performs at 75% of the original KRISP, exposes design flaws, prevents AI hallucinations, and demonstrates scalability under resource constraints.

Conclusion: The lightweight reproduction showcases the potential of efficient VQA architectures for edge devices, providing insights into design improvements and resource-efficient visual reasoning.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'warping,' a generalized dynamic sampling operator unifying existing methods and provides theoretical analysis, empirical study, and unique visualizations for insight into dynamic sampling networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and understand dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures through a theoretical framework.

Method: The authors develop a novel operator called 'warping' for dynamic sampling, analyze it using statistical models, and explore its properties through theoretical and empirical studies.

Result: The authors uncover asymmetry in the forward and backward passes, identify conditions for stable training, examine discretization effects, and introduce a new loss landscape visualization technique.

Conclusion: The research advances understanding of dynamic sampling mechanisms, providing unified theoretical insights and practical tools for analyzing and training such networks.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

*Kriti Ghosh,Devjyoti Chakraborty,Lakshmish Ramaswamy,Suchendra M. Bhandarkar,In Kee Kim,Nancy O'Hare,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces $Δ$-NeRF, a framework enabling incremental refinement of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), overcoming challenges like catastrophic forgetting and inefficiency in sequential data settings such as satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRF frameworks struggle with incremental learning as they require full retraining when new views are added, which is impractical in scenarios like satellite terrain analysis where data arrives sequentially.

Method: $Δ$-NeRF uses a modular residual framework, including a residual controller, an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism, a view selection strategy for efficient training, and knowledge distillation to reduce model size.

Result: Experiments show $Δ$-NeRF reduces training data by 47%, training time by 30-42%, and achieves up to a 43.5% improvement in PSNR over naive fine-tuning, outperforming baselines and even joint training on some metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed $Δ$-NeRF framework offers an efficient and high-performing method for incremental refinement of NeRFs, especially beneficial for sequential data tasks. It balances performance and resource efficiency effectively, advancing capabilities in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) is a framework for better control in generative video composition by decomposing unlabeled videos into foreground and background layers, and recomposing them for improved dynamics learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of data scarcity and enhance control in generative video composition, moving away from the reliance on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules.

Method: The method involves splitting an unlabeled video corpus into foreground and background, recomposing them through transformation-aware training with multi-layer fusion and augmentation, and incorporating identity-preservation loss.

Result: StM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmarks and qualitative evaluations performed by humans and VLLM.

Conclusion: The proposed Split-then-Merge (StM) framework significantly improves generative video composition, achieving greater control and realism in generated videos.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Sphinx paper introduces a synthetic environment for testing visual perception and reasoning through procedurally generated puzzles. It evaluates current models, revealing their significant gap compared to human performance, and proposes reinforcement learning methods to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for evaluating and enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities in vision-language models through precise, verifiable tasks.

Method: Sphinx generates diverse puzzles paired with ground-truth solutions for performance evaluation. It involves 25 task types and tests models like GPT-5 on these challenges, alongside applying reinforcement learning techniques (RLVR).

Result: State-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 achieve low performance (51.1% accuracy), highlighting a gap in reasoning capabilities. RLVR improves accuracy significantly on the tasks and external benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sphinx shows that current models underperform in visual reasoning tasks compared to humans. Reinforcement learning appears promising in boosting model performance, demonstrating the utility of such benchmarks for progress in multimodal AI.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper replaces diffusion prior networks for text-to-image generation with a training-free Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) method, achieving competitive results without massive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the dependency on computationally expensive and heavily trained diffusion prior networks for text-to-image generation models.

Method: The paper introduces Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), which initializes a latent visual representation using random pseudo-tokens, optimizing these based on cosine similarity with text embeddings. It proposes additional constraints (Mahalanobis-based and Nearest-Neighbor losses) to regulate optimization.

Result: Experiments on Kandinsky 2.2 demonstrate OVI's feasibility as an alternative to traditional priors. Moreover, evaluation benchmarks reveal flaws, as the models without proper priors achieve good scores despite poor perceptual quality. Constrained OVI methods enhance visual fidelity.

Conclusion: OVI presents a promising alternative to traditional diffusion priors for text-to-image generation, improving visual output while being training-free and data-free. The findings suggest current benchmarking issues and call for further exploration in this direction.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces RefTr, a 3D model designed to accurately generate vascular tree centerlines in medical imaging, reducing errors, parameters, and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting tubular tree centerlines and maintaining their topology is crucial for medical applications such as diagnosis and treatment, where missing branches can lead to severe consequences.

Method: RefTr employs a Producer-Refiner Transformer decoder architecture to generate and refine confluent trajectories in vascular trees, integrating a non-maximum suppression algorithm for merging branches and improving precision.

Result: RefTr achieves higher recall, comparable precision to state-of-the-art methods, reduced parameters, and faster inference across various public datasets.

Conclusion: RefTr emerges as a highly effective and efficient framework for 3D vascular tree analysis in medical imaging, advancing state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

TL;DR: A high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images is introduced for advancing depth estimation and related tasks, addressing challenges in real optical conditions faced by current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets as a limitation for advancing depth estimation models, which predominantly rely on synthetic data and struggle with real-world generalization.

Method: The authors constructed a dataset consisting of 18,000 high-resolution images by systematically varying focal lengths and apertures across complex real-world scenes, spanning 50 optical configurations. Specialized calibration images accompany each focal configuration for evaluation purposes.

Result: The dataset includes challenging elements like reflective surfaces, fine details, and diverse lighting conditions, enabling the assessment of classical and learning-based models for depth estimation and other optical tasks. The limitations of current state-of-the-art methods in real optical scenarios are demonstrated.

Conclusion: By addressing the realism gap between synthetic and real camera optics, this work provides a valuable dataset, calibration files, and evaluation tools, enabling reproducible research and advancing the field of depth estimation under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale, unsupervised dataset of over 82,000 videos with descriptive recall data, advancing the study of visual content memorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for scalable and diverse datasets to model visual content memorability, which is constrained by costly human-based annotation methods and limited data diversity.

Method: The authors created an unsupervised dataset leveraging online ToT (tip-of-the-tongue) retrieval queries and fine-tuned large vision-language models for tasks like recall generation and multimodal ToT retrieval.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the dataset outperformed state-of-the-art systems, including GPT-4o, in open-ended memorability description generation and demonstrated proficiency in multimodal ToT retrieval.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel dataset and modeling approach, offering a new direction for visual content memorability research and its applications.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for dynamically estimating fog parameters in stereo images, avoiding error propagation issues seen in sequential methods, and evaluates using a new, publicly available dataset (SDIRF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve visual perception systems, such as SLAM and odometry, in foggy conditions by addressing limitations of sequential parameter estimation methods.

Method: The method estimates all fog model parameters simultaneously through a new optimization problem, assuming locally homogeneous fog, and integrates with SLAM systems.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superior accuracy on synthetic foggy data and better adaptability on real fog using the SDIRF dataset.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective and accurate approach for fog parameter estimation that enhances existing visual systems in foggy conditions and provides valuable resources, including the SDIRF dataset, to the community.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V^2-SAM introduces a framework for cross-view object correspondence by using two complementary prompt generators to address viewpoint and appearance variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of establishing consistent object associations across drastically different viewpoints, such as ego-exo object correspondence.

Method: The framework, V^2-SAM, adapts SAM2 for cross-view correspondence using geometry-aware and appearance-guided prompts, combined with a multi-expert design and post-hoc cyclic consistency selection.

Result: V^2-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, such as Ego-Exo4D, DAVIS-2017, and HANDAL-X.

Conclusion: This approach effectively improves cross-view object correspondence, leveraging both geometric and appearance cues.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

### [102] [Test-Time Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Null-Text Embedding Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20889)
*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Null-TTA for test-time alignment, optimizing text embeddings for better, non-exploitative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of under or over-optimization (like reward hacking) during test-time alignment in models.

Method: Null-TTA optimizes the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance rather than latent/noise variables, ensuring semantic coherence.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art test-time alignment and cross-reward generalization.

Conclusion: Null-TTA exemplifies semantic-space optimization as effective and principled for improving test-time alignment in models.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

*Weronika Jakubowska,Mikołaj Zieliński,Rafał Tobiasz,Krzysztof Byrski,Maciej Zięba,Dominik Belter,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaINeR, a geometry-aware implicit neural representation framework for 2D images to enable flexible editing and enhanced physical simulation ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional implicit neural representations lack geometric structure and have limited capabilities for dynamic settings like local editing or physical simulations.

Method: The proposed framework, GaINeR, uses trainable Gaussian distributions along with a neural network-based INR, retrieves the nearest Gaussian embeddings, and predicts RGB values for image coordinates.

Result: GaINeR provides continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible editing capabilities.

Conclusion: GaINeR improves upon traditional INRs by integrating geometry-aware features, enabling dynamic and interactive image manipulation while being valuable for physically informed applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates a deep learning model to enhance the quality of low-dose contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI for better image restoration and diagnosis in vestibular schwannoma cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the required dose of contrast agents in MRI while ensuring sufficient image quality for diagnostic purposes.

Method: Deep learning models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce MRI images from simulated low-dose input, and their performance was evaluated for image quality and segmentation.

Result: The restored MRI images showed significant improvements in structural similarity, signal-to-noise ratio, and segmentation metrics, even at 10% of the standard dose.

Conclusion: The study’s DL model effectively enables high-quality MRI imaging and diagnosis at reduced contrast-agent doses, making it viable to achieve diagnostic results with 10%-30% of the standard dose.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

### [105] [Smooth regularization for efficient video recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20928)
*Gil Goldman,Raja Giryes,Mahadev Satyanarayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a smooth regularization technique for lightweight video recognition models, improving accuracy and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance lightweight video recognition models by addressing the complexity of temporal dynamics with smoothness and coherence in frame processing.

Method: Introduced a smooth regularization technique using Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) to promote low-acceleration solutions by penalizing abrupt shifts in intermediate-layer embeddings.

Result: Achieved 3.8%-6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600 and enhanced state-of-the-art performance by notable margins within computational constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively aligns lightweight models with natural temporal dynamics, yielding significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency; source code is available.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/gilgoldm/grw-smoothing.

*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for neuron probing in the vision domain that generates compositional explanations using open vocabulary semantic segmentation, bypassing the limitations of human-annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how neurons encode information and providing logical, compositional explanations for this encoding.

Method: The framework has three steps: 1) Specify arbitrary concepts, 2) Use open vocabulary semantic segmentation for masks, 3) Derive compositional explanations based on these masks.

Result: The framework matches or outperforms previous methods using both quantitative metrics and human interpretability tests, while being more flexible and adaptable.

Conclusion: By eliminating the dependency on human-annotated data, the framework enhances explanation flexibility across tasks, concepts, and datasets in neural network analysis.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

*Henry Marichal,Joaquin Blanco,Diego Passarella,Gregory Randall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes UruDendro4, a dataset of Pinus taeda L. tree cross-sections for studying annual growth rings, enhancing volumetric modeling and automated ring detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-ring growth analysis is essential for assessing silvicultural practices, but manual measurement is time-consuming and inaccurate. Automated algorithms require robust datasets.

Method: Introduced UruDendro4 dataset of annotated Pinus taeda L images; conducted baseline performance tests using automated detection methods, including DeepCS-TRD; executed ablation experiments.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved top performance with metrics of 0.838 (Precision), 0.782 (Recall), and an Adapted Rand Error of 0.084. Improved generalization was observed in tree-ring detection tasks.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 supports development of volumetric annual growth models and improves automatic ring detection accuracy. Manual annotations enhance dataset utility for tree growth studies.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

*Rawa Mohammed,Mina Attin,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BUSTR is a framework that generates reports for breast ultrasound without requiring paired image-report supervision, addressing key challenges in automated radiology report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automated radiology report generation for breast ultrasound caused by lack of paired image-report datasets and hallucination issues in language models.

Method: BUSTR uses structured descriptors and radiomics features, a multi-head Swin encoder trained via multitask loss, and a dual-level objective combining token-level cross-entropy and cosine-similarity alignment loss for vision-language alignment.

Result: BUSTR significantly improves both natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy on two breast ultrasound datasets, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Descriptor-aware training and alignment help achieve more accurate and clinically effective radiology reports without paired image-report data.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

### [109] [Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957)
*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'expressive composition,' a novel image-editing task prioritizing creativity over realism, using StickerNet, a framework trained on 1.8M realistic user edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address an overlooked area in image editing—non-realistic compositions meant for artistic or playful purposes, reflecting real-world user behavior on online creative platforms.

Method: The paper proposes StickerNet, a two-stage framework that classifies composition types and predicts placement parameters like opacity, location, and scale. It uses a dataset created from 1.8 million user edits on an online platform.

Result: StickerNet demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines, matching human placement behaviors closely, as shown through user studies and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes a shift in image editing research towards expressiveness and user intent, presenting a dataset and framework that align with authentic, communal editing behaviors.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is an algorithm designed to manage multi-camera traffic data efficiently, converting video feeds into text rapidly using VLMs while minimizing redundancy and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing and analyzing large-scale video data from multiple traffic cameras is challenging, and current tools like LLMs and VLMs face significant time delays in processing such data.

Method: TrafficLens employs sequential video analysis using overlapping camera areas combined with iterative prompts from VLM outputs, an object-level similarity detector to skip redundant data processing, and token-limited VLM applications.

Result: TrafficLens demonstrated a reduction in video-to-text conversion time by up to 4 times while preserving the accuracy of the extracted information in experiments using real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TrafficLens offers an efficient and accurate solution for traffic video analysis, significantly enhancing processing speed while retaining the quality of textual insights derived from the video data.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

### [111] [Privacy-Preserving Federated Vision Transformer Learning Leveraging Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20983)
*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that combines Vision Transformers (ViT) and homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification, achieving high accuracy with strong privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy concerns in collaborative healthcare machine learning, wherein federated learning traditionally exposes model gradients to privacy vulnerabilities, creating risks of sensitive medical data leakage.

Method: The authors utilize Vision Transformers (ViT) with CLS tokens as compact feature representations and CKKS homomorphic encryption to securely aggregate encrypted data, mitigating the vulnerabilities inherent in model gradients.

Result: Encrypting CLS tokens reduced communication costs by 30-fold compared to gradient encryption while maintaining privacy. The framework avoids model inversion attacks and achieves 96.12% classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02% in the encrypted domain.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances accuracy and privacy in federated learning setups for histopathology, preventing data leakage via model inversion attacks and offering a scalable, secure solution.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient style transfer framework using inversion-free dual rectified flows, which blends content and style without computationally expensive inversion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and visual distortions caused by computational inversion processes in existing training-free diffusion-based style transfer methods.

Method: The framework employs dual rectified flows to predict and fuse content and style trajectories through dynamic midpoint interpolation and attention injection, bypassing the need for inversion.

Result: The framework achieves robust fusion, high visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency, with demonstrated generalization across varied styles and content.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free method offers a powerful and efficient solution for style transfer, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches with improved performance and visual quality.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Ref-COD framework that eliminates the need for test-time references by using a class-prototype memory and a query-conditioned reference vector, achieving strong performance on the R2C7K benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems rely on dual-branch designs requiring reference images during inference, which hinders deployability, increases latency, and adds data-collection burdens.

Method: The proposed framework stores reference information into a class-prototype memory updated with EMA during training and creates a reference vector during inference through a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Additionally, it employs a bidirectional attention alignment module to bridge the gap between query features and class representations.

Result: Experiments on the R2C7K benchmark validate that the method achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies the Ref-COD task by removing the dependence on reference images at inference, making the model more efficient and deployable while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WavePCNet, a physics-driven network for accurate localization and segmentation of obscured objects in challenging optical scenarios, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to handle coherent light physics and are unreliable under low signal-to-noise conditions in imaging obscured objects.

Method: WavePCNet uses a novel physics-driven approach integrating TriWCP for coherent propagation, memory mechanisms for noise suppression, and high-frequency cross-layer compensation for robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets show superior accuracy and reliability of WavePCNet compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WavePCNet significantly enhances the perception of obscured objects under complex conditions, addressing major limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GuardTrace-VL, a safety auditor for multimodal reasoning tasks that detects unsafe content in reasoning traces using image-text analysis, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked risk of unsafe reasoning traces in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs), which current safety measures fail to detect.

Method: Develop a vision-aware safety model (GuardTrace-VL) and a progressive training scheme to monitor unsafe content in the Question-Thinking-Answer pipeline. They create a new dataset refined with MLRM and human input for training.

Result: GuardTrace-VL achieves an F1 score of 93.1% in detecting unsafe reasoning, improving by 13.5% over the strongest prior safety methods.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL improves safety in MLRMs by monitoring intermediate reasoning processes and detecting harmful content. The dataset and code will be publicly shared for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Layered image decomposition allows independent editing of foreground and background elements, overcoming existing challenges in methods and data availability.

Method: A diffusion-based inpainting model is adapted with lightweight fine-tuning and a multi-modal context fusion module for enhanced detail preservation, trained on synthetic datasets.

Result: The proposed model outperforms others in tasks like object removal and occlusion recovery, improving precision and enabling new editing possibilities.

Conclusion: By leveraging synthetic data and innovative architectures, the study advances layer decomposition, enabling more flexible and detailed image editing applications.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

*Xiaoxing You,Qiang Huang,Lingyu Li,Chi Zhang,Xiaopeng Liu,Min Zhang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MERGE is a novel framework for news image captioning that addresses incomplete information, poor cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding through an entity-aware retrieval-augmented approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to produce journalistically informative image captions by overcoming limitations like incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and poor visual-entity grounding in existing methods.

Method: MERGE introduces an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) for enriched retrieval, employs a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for better cross-modal alignment, and uses dynamic retrieval for enhanced visual-entity matching.

Result: MERGE significantly improves caption quality and named entity recognition, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on GoodNews, NYTimes800k, and Visual News datasets with notable metric gains.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates superior caption quality, robustness, and adaptability, marking a significant advancement in multimodal image captioning for news contexts.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

*Yuhang Liu,Wenjie Zhao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank introduces a meta-learning framework that selects optimal transferability metrics for source model selection based on task-specific characteristics using textual embeddings, improving task-aware metric ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting suitable source models in transfer learning is computationally expensive, and current MTE methods lack adaptability to task-specific needs.

Method: MetaRank uses a meta-learning framework to encode textual descriptions of datasets and metrics, trains a meta-predictor with listwise objectives, and ranks MTE metrics based on unseen target datasets.

Result: Experiments showed that MetaRank effectively ranks metrics across 11 models and 11 target datasets, improving task-specific metric selection.

Conclusion: MetaRank enhances task-aware, efficient selection of transferability metrics, addressing limitations in current methods and providing practical benefits in transfer learning.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses trustworthy multi-view classification by introducing prototypes to represent neighbor structures, improving efficiency, consistency, and robustness in cross-view consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving reliable decision-making in scenarios with heterogeneous, inconsistent, and conflicting multi-source information.

Method: A new framework using prototypes to simplify intra-view neighbor relations and align intra- and inter-view structures dynamically.

Result: Experiments on multi-view datasets show improved performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach ensures efficient and consistent multi-view classification outcomes, enhancing trustworthiness and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

### [120] [CameraMaster: Unified Camera Semantic-Parameter Control for Photography Retouching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21024)
*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CameraMaster, a unified framework for physically consistent image retouching using text-guided diffusion, overcoming limitations in precise camera parameter control and scalability by integrating directive and parameter embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models for image retouching struggle with physically consistent results and precise control over camera parameters (e.g., exposure, zoom). These models either rely on ambiguous prompts or train separate modules, reducing scalability and sensitivity to subtle adjustments.

Method: The authors propose CameraMaster, which decouples the camera directive into two streams: directive representation (photographer's intent) and parameter embedding (precise settings). These are used to modulate directives, content semantics, and time embeddings via cross-attention and gating for alignment across the denoising process.

Result: CameraMaster demonstrates monotonic and near-linear parameter responses, supports multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods. The framework also leverages a new large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs with camera parameter annotations.

Conclusion: CameraMaster addresses the challenges of precise and scalable parameter control in image retouching by effectively aligning semantic and parameter information. Its improvements showcase enhanced image quality, flexibility, and consistency over existing diffusion techniques.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

*Shijia Yang,Yunong Liu,Bohan Zhai,Ximeng Sun,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum,Manling Li,Chenfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaptionQA, a benchmark for evaluating the quality of image captions based on their utility in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluation standards for image captions by focusing on their utility in actual downstream tasks rather than traditional benchmarks.

Method: An extensible utility-based benchmark covering four domains (Natural, Document, E-commerce, Embodied AI) with fine-grained taxonomies. It includes 33,027 multiple-choice questions answered by a language model based only on captions.

Result: Significant gaps were found between the utility of images and their captions, with models showing up to a 32% drop in performance when relying on captions instead of images.

Conclusion: CaptionQA is launched as a robust framework for evaluating the practical applicability of captions, along with an open-source implementation for extension to new domains.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowerDance is a novel model for music-to-dance generation, prioritizing efficiency in inference speed and memory use while delivering physically plausible and expressive motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for music-to-dance generation face challenges in generation efficiency, which restricts 3D rendering quality and character expressiveness, especially in real-world applications.

Method: FlowerDance integrates MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints and uses a BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion for non-autoregressive dance generation. It also incorporates motion editing capabilities.

Result: FlowerDance demonstrates state-of-the-art motion quality and generation efficiency, as validated by experiments on the AIST++ and FineDance datasets.

Conclusion: FlowerDance successfully enhances the quality and efficiency of music-to-dance generation, with practical uses in interactive motion editing and real-world applications.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LungNoduleAgent is a collaborative multi-agent system developed to improve the precision and reliability of lung nodule diagnosis using CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in accurately describing lung nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise, which are limitations in current multimodal large language models for lung cancer diagnosis.

Method: The method involves creating LungNoduleAgent, a system with three modules: Nodule Spotter for nodule identification, Radiologist for detailed CT report generation, and Doctor Agent System for malignancy reasoning using images, CT reports, and a pathology knowledge base.

Result: Extensive testing on public and private datasets showed LungNoduleAgent outperformed existing vision-language models, agent systems, and expert models in nodule diagnosis.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent demonstrates superior diagnostic capabilities and emphasizes the role of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of spatially varying image deblurring by combining model-based constraints and generative frameworks to achieve both physical accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatially varying image deblurring either prioritize physical constraints at the cost of perceptual realism or focus on perceptual quality, leading to hallucination of details. The paper aims to reconcile these tradeoffs.

Method: The proposed method introduces a combination of a dense degradation field modeled as high-dimensional compressed kernels and incorporates physical constraints into a ControlNet architecture to guide diffusion sampling.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art model-based and generative methods in handling highly degraded, complex, and noisy blurred images.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, providing a novel and effective solution for addressing complex image deblurring scenarios.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

*Yingjie Xia,Xi Wang,Jinglei Shi,Vicky Kalogeiton,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MUSE, a framework for unified emotional generation and editing of images, leveraging emotional guidance and avoiding dataset or model update requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image emotional synthesis techniques separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications requiring intertwined synthesis processes, such as storytelling or therapy.

Method: MUSE employs strategies like Test-Time Scaling (TTS), uses off-the-shelf emotion classifiers with gradient-based optimization, identifies optimal timing for emotional guidance through semantic similarity, and implements a multi-emotion loss to reduce interference.

Result: MUSE outperforms existing methods in emotional synthesis, improving emotional accuracy, semantic diversity, content adherence, text prompt fidelity, and realistic emotional expression.

Conclusion: MUSE establishes a new paradigm in emotional synthesis, unifying generation and editing tasks while improving performance in various aspects without additional model updates.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the T-NIG model for improving Alzheimer's Disease predictions by generating intermediate and future brain images, addressing challenges from irregular temporal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome difficulties in maintaining disease-related characteristics in Alzheimer’s image generation when sequential data have irregular time intervals.

Method: The T-NIG model employs brain images at two timepoints, integrates a temporal parameter into the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution, and uses uncertainty estimation to improve long-term image generation.

Result: T-NIG achieves state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer’s disease image generation and is effective even with irregular or sparse temporal data.

Conclusion: T-NIG improves disease progression forecasting while preserving crucial disease-related features, effectively handling irregular data distributions.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

*Ziyun Zeng,Hang Hua,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRA, a multimodal reasoning agent for instruction-guided image editing, enhancing semantic accuracy and perceptual quality by iteratively handling complex editing instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models struggle with complex user instructions involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to semantically inconsistent outcomes.

Method: MIRA employs an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop to generate atomic edit instructions step-by-step using visual feedback. It uses a novel 150K multimodal dataset (MIRA-Editing) and a two-stage training pipeline: SFT + GRPO.

Result: MIRA improves editing performance in terms of semantic alignment and perceptual quality when paired with open-source models, outperforming or matching proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: MIRA successfully enhances instruction-guided image editing by enabling iterative multimodal reasoning, offering a plug-and-play solution for achieving high-quality, semantically accurate results.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel iris authentication model using a 3D-CNN for enhanced spatio-spatial-temporal feature extraction, addressing challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in iris authentication systems caused by variations in conditions and to improve use of spatio-spatial-temporal structure in pattern recognition.

Method: The approach uses a 3D-CNN on sub-images of iris patterns, trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner.

Result: Achieved robust and generalizable iris authentication despite challenging conditions such as rotation, scale, and blur.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline significantly improves iris authentication by capturing richer feature representations, enhancing robustness and discriminability.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for improving 3D reconstruction of reflective objects by converting reflections into neutral clay-like signals for better geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection presents challenges in 3D reconstruction due to the distortion caused by view-dependent appearances.

Method: A dual-branch network is designed with a reflective branch and a clay-guided branch to process reflection-free clay-like images and stabilize geometry.

Result: The framework improves normal accuracy and mesh completeness significantly compared to existing methods on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Utilizing neutral clay-like representations of reflections offers a strong inductive bias for enhancing reflective object geometry learning.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

TL;DR: RadarFM is a radar foundation model that uses structured spatial language supervision to create unified scene-level radar representations, incorporating a contrastive learning approach for better spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of foundational and unified frameworks in radar perception for various tasks, which are often fragmented and task-specific, and integrate radar sensing with advances in foundational models.

Method: RadarFM employs a structured caption framework encoding vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates and a contrastive learning objective for fine-grained spatial reasoning. Data is generated in the CARLA simulator with localization-aware evaluation metrics.

Result: RadarFM demonstrates its potential by producing robust scene-level radar representations and fine-grained spatial reasoning performance, surpassing traditional detection-only metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed radar foundation model effectively unifies radar perception tasks, advancing the field by providing transferable scene representations and improved spatial accuracy.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Method: The authors propose EM-KD, which uses a Manhattan distance-based token alignment strategy with the Hungarian matching algorithm and introduces Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD) to enhance vision-language comprehension.

Result: EM-KD achieves significant improvement in both accuracy and efficiency on diverse benchmarks and outperforms previous distillation methods equipped with the vision token matching strategy.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively resolves vision token imbalance in Efficient MLLMs, leading to superior comprehension capabilities and performance compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

*YuAn Wang,Xiaofan Li,Chi Huang,Wenhao Zhang,Hao Li,Bosheng Wang,Xun Sun,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents FaithFusion, a new framework that integrates 3D geometric scene synthesis with diffusion models for better visual and spatial consistency in 3D driving-scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in combining geometry-based and appearance-driven models in 3D scene reconstruction, especially under large viewpoint changes, to avoid issues like over-restoration and geometric drift.

Method: FaithFusion combines 3D geometric scene synthesis (3DGS) with diffusion models using a pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a policy for spatio-temporal consistency, refining uncertain regions and distilling edits back into the 3D model.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo dataset show state-of-the-art performance in metrics like NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, with an FID score of 107.47 at a 6-meter lane shift.

Conclusion: FaithFusion provides an effective and consistent method for 3D scene synthesis without needing prior conditions or structural changes, advancing scene reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

*Xin Honga,Jie Lin,Minghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), for automated learning of Alzheimer’s disease progression using temporal MRI data, achieving superior prediction and classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Alzheimer's disease prediction approaches largely rely on manual morphological analysis, requiring a solution that automates and improves early prediction accuracy to manage disease progression.

Method: The study introduces DATGN, a model that interpolates incomplete MRI temporal data, employs a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module for generating disease-progression-consistent future MRI images, and facilitates AD prediction.

Result: DATGN outperforms in generating high-quality MRI images on the ADNI dataset, improving classification accuracy by up to 16% (AD vs NC) and 21.25% (AD vs MCI vs NC) when compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DATGN provides a robust framework for early Alzheimer's prediction by generating synthetic MRI data aligned with disease progression, demonstrating its potential to enhance medical imaging-based diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

*Changlin Li,Jiawei Zhang,Zeyi Shi,Zongxin Yang,Zhihui Li,Xiaojun Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntPruner is an automated entropy-guided pruning framework designed for generative models, reducing redundancy while preserving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models like diffusion and flow models have redundant parameters when transferred to downstream tasks, necessitating an efficient pruning strategy.

Method: The paper introduces EntPruner, leveraging Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) for block importance evaluation and proposing a zero-shot adaptive progressive pruning approach.

Result: EntPruner achieves up to 2.22x inference speedup without compromising generation quality on ImageNet and other datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances pruning and generative performance, demonstrating applicability across tasks and ensuring high-quality outputs.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model for video understanding and controllable video generation using multiple modalities like depth, segmentation, and graphics-based intrinsics. It achieves strong temporal coherence and surpasses existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of under-constrained video generation caused by relying solely on geometry-based cues and to unify video understanding and generation under one framework using diverse modalities.

Method: The authors propose CtrlVDiff, a diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) for processing multiple modalities, and introduce MMVideo, a dataset combining real and synthetic videos aligned with multimodal data and captions.

Result: CtrlVDiff demonstrates superior control, fidelity, and robustness in video generation and understanding tasks, enabling precise edits such as relighting and material adjustment while handling missing modalities.

Conclusion: The study shows that integrating multiple modalities for video understanding and generation significantly improves controllability, temporal coherence, and overall performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [136] [DeepRFTv2: Kernel-level Learning for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21132)
*Xintian Mao,Haofei Song,Yin-Nian Liu,Qingli Li,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) to enhance the performance of image deblurring by enabling the network to understand the blur process on a kernel-level. This approach achieves state-of-the-art deblurring results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for image deblurring lack the ability to adequately understand the essence of the blur process, as they operate at the pixel-level or pseudo kernel-level rather than truly understanding the kernel-level blur.

Method: The approach uses a Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) to move the blur understanding from the spatial domain to Fourier space, simplifying convolution operations. FKE learns the kernel-level blur process by leveraging features rather than raw images, and employs a decoupled multi-scale architecture for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in motion deblurring. The method also holds promise for addressing other kernel-related applications and can learn physically meaningful kernels.

Conclusion: The Fourier Kernel Estimator introduces a new perspective on learning the blur process in kernel-level, significantly improving deblurring performance with potential implications for similar tasks. The model is both effective and efficient.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion models on high-resolution, multi-frame data demands significant computational resources and memory, hindering scalability and efficiency.

Method: The proposed framework involves two techniques: Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to prioritize crucial model components; and an adaptive progressive schedule that adjusts computational complexity based on convergence efficiency during training.

Result: Ent-Prog achieves up to 2.2× faster training and 2.4× GPU memory reduction compared to standard methods, while maintaining generative quality.

Conclusion: This approach effectively addresses the challenges of computational cost and memory consumption, providing a more efficient method for training human video generation models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

### [138] [Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139)
*Baoli Sun,Xinzhu Ma,Ning Wang,Zhihui Wang,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProxyFormer, an architecture for referring video object segmentation (RVOS), which uses proxy queries for enhanced video-text semantic integration and inter-frame dependency modeling, proving its effectiveness through extensive benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS models struggle with accurate object tracking due to their inability to model inter-frame dependencies and delayed integration of textual constraints, leading to focus errors on non-referred objects.

Method: ProxyFormer uses proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics progressively, enabling inter-frame dependency creation. It decouples cross-modal interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions and introduces a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) strategy for aligning semantic consensus.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four RVOS benchmarks illustrate ProxyFormer's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in performance accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: ProxyFormer enhances RVOS by introducing innovations in cross-modal alignment, improving target tracking and ensuring computational efficiency, making it a more effective solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The TEAR framework is proposed for identifying safety risks in temporal video generation by T2V models, showing an 80% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluations for static image and text models are inadequate for addressing the unique temporal dynamics and associated safety risks in video generation models.

Method: TEAR utilizes a two-stage approach: training a temporal-aware test generator with online preference learning, and refining prompts for improved stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness.

Result: TEAR achieves over 80% attack success rate in uncovering safety risks, surpassing the previous best result of 57%.

Conclusion: This framework significantly enhances the evaluation of safety risks in T2V models, showcasing the necessity of temporal-aware assessments for such technologies.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors present LLaVA-UHD v3, an efficient multi-modal large language model that uses Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enhance native-resolution encoding in Vision Transformers while significantly reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges associated with global native-resolution visual encoding methods, while maintaining high capability in multi-modal large language models.

Method: The proposed method, Progressive Visual Compression (PVC), integrates refined patch embedding for flexible patch scaling and windowed token compression hierarchically across Vision Transformer layers.

Result: The transformed Vision Transformer (ViT-UHD) achieves better efficiency in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining competitive performance across benchmarks, outperforming MoonViT and achieving similar results to Qwen2-VL.

Conclusion: LLaVA-UHD v3 successfully supports efficient native-resolution encoding for MLLMs, proving its effectiveness in balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

*Zheng Li,Yibing Song,Xin Zhang,Lei Luo,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnchorOPT, a prompt learning framework enhancing CLIP-based models with dynamic, learnable anchor tokens and adaptive positioning, achieving competitive to superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods use static textual anchors, which lack flexibility across tasks and training stages, necessitating a more adaptive solution.

Method: AnchorOPT employs dynamic anchor tokens learned from task-specific data and an adaptive position matrix optimized based on training stage and task context in a two-stage training process.

Result: AnchorOPT demonstrates performance on par with or surpassing methods using additional modules or techniques, while being a simple, plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: The proposed AnchorOPT framework is a versatile and effective improvement to prompt learning in CLIP models, showing consistent performance gains across datasets.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

*Joonhyung Park,Hyeongwon Jang,Joowon Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual autoregressive models benefit from GridAR, a test-time scaling framework improving efficiency and quality in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance visual autoregressive models for efficient and high-quality text-to-image generation under test-time scaling.

Method: GridAR introduces grid-partitioned progressive generation with partial candidate pruning and a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy for guiding generation.

Result: GridAR achieves higher quality outcomes and cost efficiency compared to traditional methods, outperforming benchmarks like Best-of-N in both quality and cost.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively adapts test-time scaling for visual AR models with superior performance in text-to-image generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D scene understanding and reasoning are becoming increasingly relevant, but there is a challenge in effectively tokenizing 3D data and using it for diverse tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a three-stage tokenization pipeline using a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation and Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec) to extract holistic scene tokens.

Result: NDTokenizer3D demonstrates strong performance in various 3D tasks like 3D Referring Segmentation, Visual Question Answering, and Dense Captioning while supporting human interaction.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D provides a unified and efficient solution for 3D scene understanding, paving the way for generalized applications in 3D vision and language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies the effects of distractors on vision-language models using a new dataset (Idis), revealing inverse scaling effects and strategies to mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multimodal vision-language models exhibit effects similar to language models when encountering distractors, particularly inverse scaling effects.

Method: The authors created Idis, a visual question-answering dataset with distractions across semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions, and analyzed reasoning processes and accuracy.

Result: The study found that visual distractors reduce accuracy without extending reasoning length and identified links between distractors, reasoning, and accuracy. Trends were validated on established benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual distractors lead to reduced accuracy in vision-language models, but targeted prompting strategies can mitigate bias-driven errors.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

*Hui Lu,Yi Yu,Yiming Yang,Chenyu Yi,Qixin Zhang,Bingquan Shen,Alex C. Kot,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores universal adversarial attacks against Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using transferable physical patches that remain effective under diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing adversarial patches that fail in black-box settings and do not perform well across different VLA models.

Method: UPA-RFAS framework includes: feature-space objectives with $	2$ deviation prior, robust min-max training, and VLA-specific losses to hijack attention and induce semantic misalignments.

Result: UPA-RFAS demonstrated transferability across models, tasks, and real-world environments, successfully exposing vulnerabilities in VLA-driven robots.

Conclusion: Universal and transferable attacks can expose VLA model weaknesses, paving the way for improved defenses in this domain.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

*Hanyang Li,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in to improve clustering results in deep clustering models by leveraging local structure cues and enhancing global feature organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods struggle with discrepancies between local structures (consistent, compact) and global structures (poorly separated). This paper aims to resolve this issue.

Method: DCBoost uses adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based filtering to identify reliable samples, serving as anchors for self-supervision. These samples guide network optimization through a discriminative loss for better clustering.

Result: Experiments show DCBoost enhances clustering performance, improving state-of-the-art models like ProPos by over 3% and increasing silhouette coefficients by more than 7-fold on benchmarks.

Conclusion: DCBoost effectively leverages local cues to refine global feature structures in deep clustering models, significantly advancing performance metrics of modern methods.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

*Selene Cerna,Sara Si-Moussi,Wilfried Thuiller,Hadrien Hendrikx,Vincent Miele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents BotaCLIP, a method to adapt pre-trained foundation models for enhanced performance in ecological tasks without retraining from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a way to inject domain-specific knowledge into pre-trained models for tasks like biodiversity modeling, while avoiding significant computational costs.

Method: BotaCLIP is introduced as a multimodal contrastive framework adapting foundation models through contrastive learning, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and adding domain-specific ecological knowledge.

Result: BotaCLIP-generated representations improved task performance in ecological applications, outperforming baselines relying on DOFA embeddings and supervised methods.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation of foundation models, as illustrated by BotaCLIP, enables effective learning in data-limited settings while incorporating specialized domain knowledge.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

### [148] [Towards an Effective Action-Region Tracking Framework for Fine-grained Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21202)
*Baoli Sun,Yihan Wang,Xinzhu Ma,Zhihui Wang,Kun Lu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework for fine-grained action recognition, which improves on recognizing subtle and localized action details through semantics and motion dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recognition methods are limited in identifying fine-grained and localized movements across time, as they rely on coarse-grained motion patterns.

Method: The ART framework employs a query-response mechanism with a region-specific semantic activation module, text-constrained queries, and multi-level tracklet contrastive constraints to enhance spatial-temporal interaction and fine-grained distinction in action recognition.

Result: ART demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on benchmarks, proving its capability to identify fine-grained action dynamics.

Conclusion: The ART framework effectively captures and tracks localized action details by leveraging language-based semantics and spatial-temporal constraints, achieving significant improvements in fine-grained action recognition.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

*Wenbo Hu,Jingli Lin,Yilin Long,Yunlong Ran,Lihan Jiang,Yifan Wang,Chenming Zhu,Runsen Xu,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces G$^2$VLM, a vision-language model that integrates 3D geometry learning to enhance spatial intelligence, particularly in spatial reasoning and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a gap in vision-language models, which lack robustness in spatial understanding due to the absence of a process for reconstructing 3D space from 2D images.

Method: G$^2$VLM combines 3D visual geometry features with semantic reasoning abilities. It is trained on multi-view image and video data using 3D visual priors to improve spatial reasoning and 3D reconstruction.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance in both 3D reconstruction and spatial reasoning tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable solution.

Conclusion: G$^2$VLM bridges the gap between language understanding and 3D spatial tasks, serving as a strong baseline for advancing research and applications like 3D scene editing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

*Umang Agarwal,Rudraksh Sangore,Sumit Laddha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow modeling paradigms for generative tasks, highlighting MeanFlow's fast single-step sampling and CFM's superior iterative sampling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore efficient and effective generative modeling paradigms and extend capabilities to tasks like image inpainting.

Method: Implemented DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow using a unified architecture (<1.5M parameters) and evaluated them on CIFAR-10 for generative modeling and image inpainting.

Result: CFM achieved FID 24.15 with 50 steps, MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling, and fine-tuned inpainting models significantly improved PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: CFM excels in iterative sampling, while MeanFlow offers rapid single-step generation. Fine-tuned inpainting-aware training further enhances image restoration.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

*Shuhan Xia,Xuannan Liu,Xing Cui,Peipei Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents T3-Tracer, a framework designed to detect partial audio forgeries by analyzing hierarchical temporal levels: frame, segment, and audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attackers selectively forge semantically crucial audio frames while maintaining perceptual authenticity, making detection challenging. Current methods lack the structured approach to detect transient and sustained anomalies.

Method: The paper proposes T3-Tracer, utilizing Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) for frame-level authentication and Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM) for segment-level boundary detection.

Result: T3-Tracer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets in detecting partial audio forgeries.

Conclusion: T3-Tracer effectively detects forgery traces by tackling the problem holistically at multiple temporal levels, showcasing significant advancement in audio forgery detection methodologies.

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Chen Ling,Henglin Shi,Hedvig Kjellström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIELDS proposes a novel method for 3D face reconstruction by combining direct 3D expression supervision and emotion recognition to improve subtle emotional consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods often fail to capture subtle emotional details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth.

Method: FIELDS employs a dual-supervision approach incorporating 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch guided by 4D facial scan data.

Result: FIELDS generates emotion-rich, highly realistic 3D face models from single images, improving facial expression recognition performance while maintaining naturalness.

Conclusion: FIELDS bridges the 2D/3D domain gap, ensuring high-fidelity reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues for improved realism and better facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

*Quentin Gabot,Teck-Yian Lim,Jérémy Fix,Joana Frontera-Pons,Chengfang Ren,Jean-Philippe Ovarlez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends Learnable Polyphase Sampling (LPS) for shift equivariance and invariance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to complex-valued networks, demonstrating improvements on classification, reconstruction, and segmentation tasks with polarimetric radar images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs lack shift equivariance and invariance, which affect performance in computer vision tasks. While data augmentation offers a workaround, a theoretical solution is needed through enhanced design of downsampling and upsampling layers.

Method: This work introduces an extension of Learnable Polyphase Sampling (LPS) to complex-valued neural networks, complemented by a projection layer from the complex to real domain before applying Gumbel Softmax.

Result: The approach is evaluated on various computer vision problems, effectively demonstrating equivariance in reconstruction and segmentation tasks and invariance in classification tasks using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Conclusion: Extending LPS to complex-valued networks theoretically and practically ensures shift invariance and equivariance, improving performance in both classification and segmentation problems.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AVFakeBench, a new benchmark for audio-video forgery detection, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by providing rich forgery semantics, detailed annotations, and diverse evaluation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-video forgery detection benchmarks are limited to deepfake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, failing to address the diversity and complexity of modern forgery methods.

Method: The authors developed AVFakeBench, a benchmark containing 12,000 audio-video forgeries across seven types and four annotation levels, generated via a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework combining proprietary task-planning models and expert generative models.

Result: They tested 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 detection methods on AVFakeBench, showing AV-LMMs' potential for forgery detection but highlighting their struggles with detailed perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench provides a comprehensive foundation for advancing audio-video forgery detection and reveals the present strengths and weaknesses of current AV-LMM detectors.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

*Sizhuo Zhou,Xiaosong Jia,Fanrui Zhang,Junjie Li,Juyong Zhang,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Songbur Wong,Junqi You,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LaGen, a novel framework for autoregressive and interactive long-horizon LiDAR scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR data generation methods only support single-frame generation or deterministic multi-frame prediction, lacking long-horizon interactivity.

Method: LaGen enables autoregressive generation from a single LiDAR frame while incorporating object-level decoupling and noise modulation to enhance performance.

Result: Experimental results show that LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating high-fidelity, long-horizon LiDAR scenes, especially for later frames.

Conclusion: LaGen advances LiDAR scene generation by enabling interactive, autoregressive long-horizon generation with improved fidelity and effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

*Juncheng Chen,Chao Xu,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MatchGS, a framework that refines 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for geometrically accurate training data, enabling robust zero-shot image matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image matching relies on accurate and diverse training data, but current 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques suffer from geometric inaccuracies that hinder reliable correspondence labeling.

Method: MatchGS refines 3DGS geometry to produce precise correspondence labels, creates a diverse data generation pipeline, and employs a 2D-3D representation alignment to guide 2D matchers with 3D knowledge.

Result: MatchGS reduces epipolar error by up to 40x compared to existing datasets, provides superior supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and enhances zero-shot performance on benchmarks with up to 17.7% improvements.

Conclusion: With geometric refinement, 3DGS becomes a scalable and high-fidelity data source, enabling the development of robust and effective zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Motivation: The study aims to develop a unified model for remote sensing (RS) tasks that excels in multiple tasks, building on the success of transformers and VLMs, while overcoming challenges in data handling, UHR image reasoning, and task scalability.

Method: RSCoVLM is proposed, featuring a data curation engine for managing RS data complexity and a unified dynamic-resolution strategy. It also introduces the Zoom-in Chain mechanism for ultra-high-resolution images and a novel evaluation protocol for fair comparisons.

Result: RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple RS tasks, surpassing existing VLMs and specialized expert models. The methods mitigate computation challenges and improve generalization.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM serves as an effective and flexible baseline for RS multi-task learning, facilitating further advancement in general-purpose RS models. All resources are made open-source to support reproducibility.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

TL;DR: PathMamba is a hybrid architecture combining Mamba's sequential modeling and Vision Transformer's global reasoning for road segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve road segmentation accuracy and topological continuity while addressing computational limitations of Vision Transformers.

Method: PathMamba integrates Mamba blocks for continuous road network modeling with Transformer blocks for global feature refinement.

Result: PathMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior topological segmentation on DeepGlobe and Massachusetts Roads datasets, excelling in the APLS metric.

Conclusion: PathMamba combines efficiency and accuracy, addressing limitations of existing models for road segmentation in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Motivation: The motivation is to solve the issue of cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation, which arises from attention ambiguity and unstable appearance-structure coupling in existing models.

Method: The method involves introducing geometry-calibrated attention through two modules: Part-Aligned Attention for enforcing spatial alignment, and Condition-Routed Attention for routing appearance information using geometry-conditioned pathways. This is integrated into a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: CaliTex produces seamless, view-consistent 3D textures and outperforms current open-source and commercial systems.

Conclusion: CaliTex addresses cross-view inconsistency effectively, making geometric coherence an inherent part of the network rather than merely a result of optimization.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

### [160] [HTTM: Head-wise Temporal Token Merging for Faster VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21317)
*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTTM, an effective token merging method that accelerates VGGT for 3D scene reconstruction without significantly compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The latency issue in VGGT's global attention mechanism for large scenes and long-sequence inputs necessitates an efficient solution to accelerate processing without degrading results.

Method: HTTM (head-wise temporal merging) combines tokens at the head-level granularity in transformer layers, enabling efficient compression while maintaining the model's representational power.

Result: HTTM offers up to 7x acceleration in GPU-based inference with negligible performance decay when reconstructing large 3D scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed HTTM method effectively enhances the efficiency of the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer, establishing a pathway for faster 3D scene reconstructions while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

*Stefanos Koutoupis,Michaela Areti Zervou,Konstantinos Kontras,Maarten De Vos,Panagiotis Tsakalides,Grigorios Tsagatakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConFu, a framework for joint representation learning across multiple modalities, addressing the challenge of balancing pairwise relationships and higher-order dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal learning methods either neglect higher-order interactions or fail to maintain pairwise relationships effectively. There is a need for an approach that captures both aspects.

Method: The proposed ConFu framework creates a unified representation space by embedding individual modalities alongside fused combinations. It extends contrastive learning to include fused-modality terms, enabling learning of higher-order dependencies while retaining pairwise alignment.

Result: ConFu achieves strong performance on both synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks across retrieval and classification tasks. It effectively captures cross-modal complementarity, higher-order dependencies, and scales well with multimodal complexity.

Conclusion: ConFu balances both pairwise and higher-order relationships, making it a robust framework for multimodal tasks, and facilitates integrated retrieval tasks from a single contrastive framework.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIFT-SNN, a low-latency pipeline using neuromorphic computing to detect transport infrastructure anomalies, achieving 92.3% accuracy with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a real-time, low-latency, and energy-efficient system that enhances structural safety monitoring for critical transport infrastructure.

Method: The method involves integrating SIFT for spatial feature extraction, a spike conversion layer, and LIF spiking neural networks for anomaly classification, tested on a 6,000-frame dataset with real and augmented unsafe cases.

Result: The framework achieves 92.3% classification accuracy, a per-frame inference time of 9.5ms, sparse spike activity of 8.1%, and is suitable for low-power edge deployment.

Conclusion: The SIFT-SNN framework improves spatial feature interpretability, efficiency for embedded hardware, and decision transparency. While it performs well, its generalisation to unseen conditions requires further validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications.

It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

*Qing Li,Huifang Feng,Kanle Shi,Yue Gao,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for estimating normals of point clouds by fusing multi-scale features to address challenges with patch size selection and improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining appropriate neighborhood sizes for normal estimation in point clouds is challenging, especially across diverse data and geometries.

Method: The proposed method uses multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation to approximate an optimal geometric description for normal estimation. It progressively shrinks patch sizes and keeps essential features from earlier layers.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer network parameters and faster computation time on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-scale feature fusion can adapt to varying patches and enhance normal estimation accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

*Yangle Liu,Fengze Li,Kan Liu,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Endo-G$^{2}$T, a novel method to improve 4D Gaussian splatting for endoscopic videos by anchoring geometry early and ensuring temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with view-dependent effects in endoscopic videos, leading to geometric drift and reduced reconstruction accuracy.

Method: The paper presents a three-part approach: geo-guided depth supervision with soft priors; time-embedded Gaussian field modeling motion and geometry in XYZT; and keyframe-constrained streaming for efficient long-horizon optimization.

Result: Experiments on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets show that Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves superior performance compared to existing monocular reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: Endo-G$^{2}$T offers a practical solution for dynamic scene reconstruction in endoscopic videos, improving geometry anchoring, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: The paper presents STVG-o1, a framework enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to excel in spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) tasks without architectural modifications, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often underperform in STVG due to misaligned objectives and weak region-word alignment in visual encoders.

Method: The STVG-o1 framework introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism for spatio-temporal reasoning and employs a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function for fine-tuning.

Result: STVG-o1 achieves new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods and showcasing strong generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: MLLMs, with enhancements like STVG-o1, can serve as powerful backbones for spatio-temporal grounding tasks with precise open-vocabulary generalization.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents Monet, a framework for multimodal large language models that enhances visual reasoning by generating visual embeddings as intermediate steps while addressing challenges like computation cost and supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve human-like abstract visual thinking in multimodal large language models, as current methods are limited by dependency on external visual reasoning tools.

Method: The authors introduce a three-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline and a reinforcement learning approach named VLPO to incorporate latent visual embeddings into reasoning. They also construct a CoT dataset for training.

Result: Monet-7B demonstrates consistent improvement on benchmarks for real-world perception and reasoning, and generalizes well to abstract visual tasks. Empirical analyses provided insights for improving latent reasoning.

Conclusion: Monet effectively enables multimodal language models to engage in abstract visual reasoning, breaking new ground in integrating latent visual space into the reasoning process. It shows promise for future developments in the field.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiverseVAR improves text-conditioned visual autoregressive models' image diversity at test time without retraining or fine-tuning, balancing diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-conditioned VAR models struggle with generating diverse outputs for simple prompts, largely ignored due to focus on image quality.

Method: Introduces text-embedding noise injection for diversity enhancement and a novel scale-travel refinement to minimize image quality loss.

Result: Combining proposed techniques enhances diversity while maintaining quality, establishing a better trade-off between the two.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR shifts the performance frontiers of VAR models, improving diversity without sacrificing image quality or requiring model retraining.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for remote sensing change captioning by combining CNN/Transformer global features, SAM for region-specific details, and a knowledge graph to improve captioning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance remote sensing change captioning by addressing weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment in existing methods.

Method: The method integrates CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM to extract region-level details, and a knowledge graph to provide object-related context, followed by cross-attention and a Transformer decoder for caption generation.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Using SAM, heterogeneous information fusion, and a knowledge graph significantly improves captioning accuracy, and the code will be released for community use.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel multimodal 3D reassembly framework, E-M3RF, that uses both geometric and color features to address the challenges of assembling fractured fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current learning-based 3D reassembly methods mainly rely on geometric features and lack physical constraints, struggling with ambiguous or insufficiently detailed fragments, such as symmetric or eroded shapes.

Method: The E-M3RF framework employs SE(3) flow matching to predict transformation for reassembly. It uses a rotation-equivariant encoder for geometric features and a transformer for color features, combining both into a multimodal representation.

Result: E-M3RF demonstrated significant improvements over competing methods, reducing rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% on the RePAIR dataset.

Conclusion: E-M3RF improves 3D reassembly accuracy by effectively combining geometric and color information in a physically constrained, multimodal framework.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Method: A lightweight motion tokenizer encodes motion dynamics, followed by an unsupervised action segmenter with a novel Latent Action Energy metric for discovering semantically coherent action primitives. Structured data is output for VLA pre-training.

Result: The method effectively segments key tasks in industrial videos, with semantic coherence validated using Vision-Language Models on public benchmarks and proprietary datasets.

Conclusion: This is the first end-to-end automated system for organizing VLA pre-training data from industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for AI in manufacturing.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel hypergraph-guided mechanism to address spatial sparsity in asynchronous event streams, enabling multi-modal feature learning for event classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event representation methods face challenges with spatial sparsity in asynchronous event streams, leading to incomplete data utilization.

Method: The approach employs hypergraphs to connect event tokens across time and space, utilizing message passing for sparse event completion and incorporating RGB tokens for multi-modal information fusion. Self-attention aggregates hypergraph data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on single- and multi-label event classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed hypergraph-based method successfully addresses spatial sparsity, enhances event representation learning, and supports effective multi-modal feature fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges and slow speed of diffusion models to achieve high-resolution I2V synthesis on mobile devices in real-time.

Method: The paper proposes a linear hybrid architecture denoiser, a time-step distillation strategy significantly reducing sampling steps, and mobile-specific attention optimizations, all aimed at enhancing efficiency and quality.

Result: MobileI2V achieves fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, offering speed improvement and quality comparable to existing models. Frame generation takes less than 100ms at 720p resolution.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates a lightweight solution for real-time I2V on mobile devices, making high-resolution generation efficient and practical for mobile environments.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational complexity challenge of Vision Transformers caused by their quadratic scaling with token length while preserving performance.

Method: The method divides tokens into high- and low-frequency categories, selectively preserving high-frequency tokens, while aggregating low-frequency tokens into a compact token to retain the essential components.

Result: The proposed strategy significantly enhances accuracy, reduces computational overhead, and mitigates rank collapsing and over-smoothing through detailed experiments.

Conclusion: The frequency-aware token reduction strategy effectively balances performance and efficiency, highlighting the importance of considering frequency characteristics in self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

*Taehoon Kim,Donghwan Jang,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) is a training approach for Class Incremental Learning that directly manipulates model weights to improve performance and reduce catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning by developing a method that effectively integrates and preserves knowledge across tasks.

Method: The proposed method applies inter-task and intra-task weight merging to unify and optimize model weights. Inter-task merging averages model weights from previous tasks, while intra-task merging combines parameters within the current stage. Bounded updates maintain knowledge from previous tasks.

Result: Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that M&B delivers superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The M&B approach provides an effective and architecture-agnostic solution for improving Class Incremental Learning, successfully preserving prior knowledge and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new knowledge distillation framework, CanKD, uses cross-attention mechanisms for better feature transfer and achieves superior results in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in feature-based distillation through more thorough pixel-wise relations between teacher and student models.

Method: Introduced Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), which uses cross-attention mechanisms and a new loss function for knowledge transfer.

Result: Experimental results show that CanKD surpasses existing state-of-the-art distillation methods in object detection and image segmentation.

Conclusion: CanKD is a promising framework for attention-guided distillation, leveraging cross-attention for enhanced knowledge transfer in computer vision.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in fairly comparing deepfake detection methods caused by reliance on implementation details rather than core design.

Method: Systematic investigation of different design choices influencing accuracy and generalization capabilities, focusing on training, inference, and incremental updates.

Result: Identified design choices improve deepfake detection and achieve state-of-the-art results on AI-GenBench.

Conclusion: Robust practices isolated to guide future development of deepfake detection systems, enhancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

### [178] [Self-Paced Learning for Images of Antinuclear Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21519)
*Yiyang Jiang,Guangwu Qian,Jiaxin Wu,Qi Huang,Qing Li,Yongkang Wu,Xiao-Yong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced framework for automating antinuclear antibody (ANA) detection in clinical settings using unaltered microscope images. It demonstrates significant performance improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of manual ANA detection, such as being slow, labor-intensive, and challenging, while also overcoming the complexities of multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning for real-world ANA detection.

Method: The proposed framework comprises three core components: an instance sampler to handle low-confidence instances, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher for adaptive labeling, and self-paced learning to optimize training. These approaches enable end-to-end optimization and handle unprocessed microscope images.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP improvements on the ANA dataset. It also shows strong performance metrics like reduced Hamming loss and one-error across public datasets.

Conclusion: The novel framework offers an efficient, automated solution for ANA detection, setting state-of-the-art results and enhancing diagnostic accuracy for autoimmune disease recognition. The code is openly available for further research and use.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

*Pierre Adorni,Minh-Tan Pham,Stéphane May,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs), focusing on efficiency over scaling model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the resource-intensive nature of current foundation models and proposing a more sustainable AI framework, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Method: The authors propose a modular approach using task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists for RSFMs, which can be frozen, reused, and integrated into a federated training setup.

Result: Their framework achieves scalable and efficient training for RSFMs while addressing concerns of accessibility, interpretability, and resource use.

Conclusion: This work provides an alternative to large-scale model training by using an ensemble of reusable specialists, promoting efficiency and sustainability in AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology for improved Alzheimer's disease prediction through sequential MRI image generation using quantitative metrics and age-scaling, which enhances image accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in predicting Alzheimer's disease progression due to irregular timing in image capture, aiming for better treatment personalization.

Method: A technique for sequential generation of MRI images guided by quantitative metrics, with the introduction of an age-scaling factor for age-specific imaging.

Result: Results show enhanced accuracy in synthesized MRI images with a Structural Similarity Index of 0.882, indicating high fidelity and effective prediction of disease progression.

Conclusion: The integration of quantitative metrics and age-scaling significantly improves image synthesis for Alzheimer's diagnosis and prognosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach, PRFL, for aligning video generation with human preferences more efficiently by optimizing in latent space instead of pixel space, reducing memory usage and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning video generation with human preferences are inefficient due to reliance on computationally expensive pixel-space models and lack early-stage supervision, limiting their effectiveness in refining motion dynamics and structure.

Method: The proposed PRFL framework leverages pre-trained video generation models to conduct preference optimization directly in the noisy latent space, avoiding VAE decoding and ensuring efficient backpropagation across the entire denoising process.

Result: PRFL demonstrates notable improvements in alignment with human preferences, along with significant reductions in memory consumption and training time when compared to traditional methods using RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: The study highlights PRFL as a superior alternative for video generation tasks, offering enhanced efficiency and better alignment with human preferences by operating entirely in latent space.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

*Kang Du,Xue Liao,Junpeng Xia,Chaozheng Guo,Yi Gu,Yirui Guan,Duotun Wang,ShengHuang,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAVLight, a benchmark addressing illumination inconsistency in multi-view 3D reconstruction, especially for UAV-based settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of illumination inconsistency in 3D reconstruction due to varying lighting conditions like sunlight, shadows, and cloud cover, which significantly impact the reliability of existing frameworks.

Method: The authors developed UAVLight, a controlled benchmark dataset capturing consistent scenes under varying natural lighting conditions through repeatable, geo-referenced UAV flights.

Result: UAVLight offers controlled, real-world natural lighting variations in scenes, enabling standardized evaluation protocols for robust and consistent 3D reconstruction benchmarking.

Conclusion: UAVLight serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing illumination-robust 3D reconstruction approaches, particularly in outdoor UAV scenarios, ensuring results are consistent and adaptable to lighting changes.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

*Xiang Gu,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MRPD, a teacher-student framework enhancing 3D point cloud model robustness against diverse adversarial attacks efficiently during training, without extra computational costs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks challenge the reliability of 3D point cloud models, especially in security-sensitive applications, and existing defenses struggle with computational overhead and generalization to different attack types.

Method: The MRPD framework employs multimodal inputs from three teachers (vision, 3D, and text), integrates their embeddings, and uses a confidence-gated distillation mechanism to train student models efficiently during training.

Result: Experiments confirm MRPD excels compared to state-of-the-art defenses, offering superior robustness against various attacks and improved clean data performance.

Conclusion: MRPD is a practical and effective solution for building robust 3D vision systems by leveraging multimodal knowledge, addressing computation and generalization challenges.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel model to enhance landmark detection for pelvic fluoroscopy, focusing on variable and realistic patient poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for pelvic fluoroscopy landmark detection assume fixed imaging views, which limits accuracy under variable intra-operative conditions.

Method: The researchers introduce a U-Net landmark prediction model, incorporating 2D/3D landmark registration and Pose Estimation Loss during training.

Result: They compare the performance of a baseline U-Net, and versions trained or fine-tuned using Pose Estimation Loss, under conditions mimicking realistic variability in patient pose.

Conclusion: The study suggests that Pose Estimation Loss improves landmark detection accuracy in variable intra-operative imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Harmony, a system that addresses challenges in synchronized audio-visual generation by focusing on improving alignment during the generative process. It achieves superior quality in audio-visual synchronization and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve audio-visual synchronization in generative AI models, which have been limited by issues like correspondence drift, inefficient attention mechanisms, and intra-modal bias in classifier-free guidance.

Method: The authors propose a framework called Harmony, which includes three key contributions: (1) Cross-Task Synergy training to tackle correspondence drift, (2) a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for better temporal alignment, and (3) SyncCFG, a new method to enhance synchronization during inference.

Result: Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results in both generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization, surpassing existing methods in the field.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that addressing fundamental challenges in the joint diffusion process can significantly improve synchronized audio-visual synthesis, with Harmony setting a new standard for quality and alignment.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the research is the challenge of detecting oral cancer at early stages due to visual similarities among lesions and the potential to improve clinical outcomes with computer-aided diagnosis systems.

Method: The study uses deep learning combined with stratified data splitting, data augmentation, and oversampling techniques to classify sixteen types of oral lesions, addressing challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets.

Result: The proposed model achieved 83.33% accuracy, 89.12% precision, and 77.31% recall, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By demonstrating the utility of oversampling and augmentation in minority class classification, the work lays a foundation for reliable computer-aided diagnostic systems for early oral cancer detection.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN improves motion coherence in video diffusion models, addressing previous issues like jitter and ghosting, by training a motion-focused discriminator and maintaining visual fidelity. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in video diffusion models that struggle with motion coherence and realism, caused by standard denoising objectives.

Method: MoGAN employs a motion-centric framework with an optical-flow discriminator and a distribution-matching regularizer to enhance motion realism in video diffusion models.

Result: MoGAN improves motion quality notably across benchmarks (e.g., +13.3% on VBench and +8.8% on VideoJAM-Bench over certain models) while retaining visual quality.

Conclusion: MoGAN offers a significant improvement in motion realism in video generation, providing a faster, high-quality, and practical solution.

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SAM's performance on remote sensing imagery (RSI), addressing the challenges of domain shift and limited annotations.

Method: The proposed method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop using self-prompting and point supervision to adapt SAM to RSIs without full-mask supervision, progressively improving segmentation quality.

Result: The method outperforms pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods across three RSI datasets: WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10.

Conclusion: Self-prompting and semantic alignment enable efficient point-level adaptation of foundational segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Motivation: Skeleton-based action recognition relies on graph convolutional networks, which perform well but depend on large labeled datasets. Practical scarcity of such data motivates the development of more label-efficient models.

Method: The paper presents a novel acquisition function using an adversarial strategy for selecting diverse, representative, and uncertain data for labeling. Additionally, it introduces bidirectional and stable GCNs to effectively map ambient and latent data spaces.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that the proposed label-efficient GCN achieves significant performance improvements on two challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance action recognition with fewer labeled data, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the label-efficient GCN approach.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

TL;DR: Qwen3-VL is a cutting-edge vision-language model designed for exceptional performance across multimodal tasks, with advanced architecture to support large context lengths and complex reasoning in text, images, and video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing need for powerful models capable of handling diverse multimodal contexts and tasks, including long-context comprehension and robust reasoning across text, images, and video.

Method: The proposed model introduces architectural upgrades like interleaved-MRoPE for enhanced spatial-temporal operations, DeepStack for improved vision-language integration, and text-based time alignment for video analysis, alongside dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants.

Result: Qwen3-VL demonstrates strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, improved pure-text understanding, and effective large-context handling, outperforming comparable models in multiple benchmarks like MMMU, MathVista, and MathVision.

Conclusion: Qwen3-VL proves to be an advanced engine for multimodal reasoning and applications, presenting significant progress in integrating text, images, and video into real-world workflows with scalable performance options.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for correcting AI prediction errors on resource-constrained devices using few-shot learning through prototypes rather than model retraining, combining server-side training and on-device efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AI prediction errors that negatively impact user experience in resource-constrained devices, emphasizing the need for efficient correction mechanisms.

Method: The system employs server-side training with knowledge distillation and on-device prototype-based classification for ultra-efficient error correction.

Result: The system achieved over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on datasets like Food-101 and Flowers-102, with minimal forgetting and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an efficient way to correct AI misclassifications, validated through a practical Android implementation, proving its feasibility in real-world resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

### [192] [CaFlow: Enhancing Long-Term Action Quality Assessment with Causal Counterfactual Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21653)
*Ruisheng Han,Kanglei Zhou,Shuang Chen,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces CaFlow, a novel framework for Action Quality Assessment (AQA) that integrates counterfactual de-confounding and bidirectional time-conditioned flow to improve performance on long-term tasks like figure skating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQA methods face challenges in long-term assessments due to reliance on costly annotations, unidirectional temporal modeling, and vulnerability to contextual confounders.

Method: The approach combines a Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module to isolate causal features and enforce robustness and a BiT-Flow module for bidirectional temporal modeling to ensure smooth and consistent representations.

Result: CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in experiments conducted on several long-term AQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CaFlow provides a robust and effective solution for long-term AQA tasks by leveraging counterfactual de-confounding and bidirectional temporal modeling.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

TL;DR: The paper presents Multi-Crit, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal judges' ability to follow diverse evaluation criteria and produce accurate judgments. Analysis reveals major challenges in maintaining criterion-level consistency, especially for open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration into how effectively large multimodal models (LMMs) can follow fine-grained, diverse evaluation criteria and ensure reliable, criterion-specific judgments.

Method: A benchmark called Multi-Crit was developed, featuring a rigorous data curation process that collects challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It introduces novel metrics to assess models' adherence to pluralistic criteria, flexibility, and recognition of conflicts.

Result: The study reveals proprietary LMMs struggle with consistent adherence to criteria, open-source models perform worse, and fine-tuning for holistic judgments improves visual grounding but fails at criterion-level generalization. Additional tests highlight the boundary between model types.

Conclusion: Multi-Crit provides a foundation for advancing reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation, emphasizing the need for further improvement in pluralistic and diverse criterion understanding among current models.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADVLA is a novel framework that applies adversarial perturbations on projected visual features in the textual space for Vision-Language-Action models, achieving efficiency, subtlety, and effectiveness in attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on Vision-Language-Action models are often costly and result in conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality. This paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: ADVLA applies adversarial perturbations directly on the textual feature projection of visual encoder outputs. It uses attention guidance to focus and sparsify perturbations, employs three sensitivity enhancement strategies, and utilizes Top-K masking for localized attacks.

Result: Under $L_\infty=4/255$ constraints, ADVLA modifies less than 10% of image patches while achieving nearly 100% attack success rate. It does so efficiently in about 0.06 seconds per iteration, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: ADVLA offers a cost-efficient, inconspicuous, and highly effective approach to perturbing VLA models, demonstrating its strong practical value for adversarial attacks in this domain.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

*Pandiyaraju V,Sreya Mynampati,Abishek Karthik,Poovarasan L,D. Saraswathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model achieving high segmentation and classification performance in glioma diagnosis using specialized attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the early and accurate diagnosis of glioma tumors, which have high mortality, by addressing the challenges in MRI segmentation and classification.

Method: Developed a hybrid deep learning framework integrating U-Net for segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network augmented with multi-head attention and spatial-channel attention.

Result: The proposed model achieved 98% Dice coefficient for tumor segmentation and 99% accuracy for classification, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates great potential in enabling reliable diagnosis and grading of gliomas, facilitating better treatment planning for patients.

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model (CamFormer) to perceive video content solely based on camera trajectories, demonstrating that camera movement contains meaningful information about video content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether video content can be interpreted solely based on camera trajectories without relying on visual pixel data.

Method: The authors proposed CamFormer, an encoder trained using contrastive learning to map camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space that aligns with natural language descriptions.

Result: CamFormer produces embeddings that successfully support a variety of downstream tasks like cross-modal alignment, classification, and temporal analysis. The model performs effectively across diverse camera pose estimation methods.

Conclusion: Camera trajectories provide an informative, lightweight, and robust modality for understanding video content, offering a new perspective in the field of video perception.

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework for generating images based on diverse user controls like text prompts, poses, and layouts, overcoming limitations in current diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern diffusion models lack effective compositional and multimodal control when processing complex user inputs involving text, references, and spatial constraints.

Method: The authors propose encoding diverse control signals into a composite canvas interface and develop a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy to integrate these controls into diffusion model learning.

Result: Canvas-to-Image exhibits superior performance in identity preservation and adherence to multiple controls across benchmarks, outperforming existing methods in various compositional tasks.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully enables integrated reasoning across multiple control modalities, addressing shortcomings in diffusion models and advancing compositional text-to-image generation.

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

*Dionysios Adamopoulos,Anastasia Poulopoulou,Georgios Goumas,Christina Giannoula*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spira, a novel sparse convolution engine for GPUs that exploits voxel coordinate properties to enhance the performance of 3D point cloud networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of sparse convolution engines by addressing their high preprocessing and postprocessing overheads, which stems from the inefficient handling of voxel coordinate properties in current engines.

Method: Spira utilizes four novel contributions: (i) a one-shot search algorithm for kernel map construction without preprocessing, (ii) a packed-native processing scheme for low-cost voxel coordinate access, (iii) a dual-dataflow execution mechanism for efficient computation of output feature vectors, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy to build kernel maps concurrently for all layers in the network.

Result: Spira achieves 1.71x average and up to 2.31x improvements in end-to-end inference performance, and 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x improvements in layer-wise execution, compared to prior sparse convolution engines.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate Spira's capability to effectively address the processing challenges in sparse convolution operations, highlighting its contributions to boosting the efficiency of 3D point cloud networks.

Abstract: Sparse Convolution (SpC) powers 3D point cloud networks widely used in autonomous driving and AR/VR. SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in adapting traditional HPC systems to handle dynamic AI application workloads for AI inference.

Method: Integration of vLLM, Slurm, and Kubernetes onto the RAMSES supercomputer to enhance synchronicity and scalability for serving LLMs.

Result: The architecture can handle 100, 500, and 1000 concurrent requests, with an additional latency of only ~500 ms.

Conclusion: The solution effectively scales and meets latency needs, showcasing the feasibility of HPC systems for dynamic AI workloads.

Abstract: Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data redundancy method to enhance GPU performance for the P2P operator in MLFMA by improving memory locality, resulting in significant kernel speedup but limited end-to-end application enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the memory locality issue in GPU performance bottlenecks associated with the near-field (P2P) operator in MLFMA, proposing a solution to optimize performance.

Method: The authors introduce a data redundancy strategy to boost spatial locality, validated using a Locality metric model for performance prediction, without emphasizing hardware-specific profiling.

Result: Results demonstrate up to 7X speedup in kernel performance due to enhanced memory behavior, though overall application speedup is limited to 1.04X due to restructuring overhead.

Conclusion: Data redundancy improves GPU performance for MLFMA applications but is most effective when the benefits of enhanced locality exceed data movement costs; minimal code changes are needed for integration.

Abstract: The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability concerns in private cloud file storage by developing a methodology for system availability evaluation and decision support.

Method: The authors use Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) modeling to analyze four different architectural redundancy strategies for a private cloud file server hosted on Apache CloudStack.

Result: Both host-level and virtual machine-level redundancies significantly improve system availability by reducing expected downtime compared to baseline configurations.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively evaluates availability and aids infrastructure design decisions for reliable private cloud systems.

Abstract: Cloud-based storage platforms are becoming more common in both academic and business settings due to their flexible access to data and support for collaborative functionalities. As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime. The proposed approach provides a method to evaluate the availability of a private cloud and support infrastructure design decisions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Aragog, a system designed to adapt workflow configurations dynamically to enhance efficiency in handling complex tasks involving LLMs, demonstrating significant improvement in throughput and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the computational challenges of serving agentic workflows at scale, as existing fixed configuration approaches fail to adapt to fluctuating system loads during lengthy execution processes.

Method: Aragog decouples the problem into identifying all accuracy-preserving configurations via a routing step and dynamically selecting configurations with a scheduler based on live system observations, introducing strategies to accelerate these processes.

Result: Aragog significantly increases throughput (by 50-217%) and decreases latency (by 32.5-78.9%), while ensuring accuracy comparable to the costliest configurations, across various workflows and models.

Conclusion: The study concludes that progressive adaptation via Aragog is an effective method for optimizing workflow execution under varying runtime dynamics, making it viable for scalable and efficient agentic workflows.

Abstract: Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.

Method: A real-time load monitoring system adjusts resource allocation dynamically along with tailored request-scheduling policies to optimize performance.

Result: DOPD demonstrated up to 1.5X improvement in system goodput, reduced token generation latency by up to 67.5%, and improved SLO attainment over 99% with minimal extra resource usage.

Conclusion: DOPD delivers efficient LLM inference under high concurrency by dynamically addressing bottlenecks, improving system throughput and reducing latency effectively.

Abstract: To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.

### [204] [Handling of Memory Page Faults during Virtual-Address RDMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21018)
*Antonis Psistakis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mechanism to handle page faults with RDMA on high-speed networks by integrating it with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project, reducing reliance on traditional pinning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to eliminate inefficiencies and complexities introduced by traditional RDMA techniques (e.g., memory pinning) that cannot fully handle page faults, especially considering modern OS optimizations like Transparent Huge Pages.

Method: A new page-fault handling mechanism was implemented, integrating with ExaNeSt's DMA engine using a combination of hardware modifications, software library development, SMMU driver changes, and updates to DMA scheduling logic.

Result: Experiments conducted on a Quad-FPGA Daughter Board demonstrated the mechanism’s ability to efficiently detect and resolve page faults, reducing overhead associated with traditional methods such as memory pinning.

Conclusion: The mechanism provides an efficient alternative to address page faults in RDMA without the disadvantages of memory pinning, improving performance and resource utilization.

Abstract: Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.
  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.
  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.
  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper addresses memory bottlenecks in training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models by proposing MemFine, which optimizes memory usage and throughput on constrained GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the critical memory bottleneck during large-scale MoE model training caused by severe load imbalances and GPU memory overflow.

Method: MemFine introduces a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework using chunked recomputation strategies and a theoretical memory model to balance throughput and memory efficiency.

Result: MemFine lowers activation memory usage by 48.03% and increases throughput by 4.42% compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: MemFine facilitates stable and scalable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs, overcoming traditional memory challenges.

Abstract: The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.

### [206] [Diagonal Scaling: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Model and Optimization Framework for Distributed Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21612)
*Shahir Abdullah,Syed Rohit Zaman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-dimensional scaling model for cloud databases to optimize performance, cost, and scalability simultaneously, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cloud database scaling is limited to either horizontal or vertical adjustments, which often result in inefficient performance and high costs.

Method: The authors introduce the Scaling Plane model, define performance metrics over it, and propose DIAGONALSCALE, a local-search algorithm to find optimal scaling trajectories.

Result: Experimental evaluations show diagonal scaling improves latency by 40%, reduces cost-per-query by 37%, and minimizes rebalancing overhead significantly.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional scaling is crucial for improving cloud database efficiency, and the proposed model lays the groundwork for smarter autoscaling techniques.

Abstract: Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.

*Beth Plale,Neelesh Karthikeyan,Isuru Gamage,Joe Stubbs,Sachith Withana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study explores the use of dynamic AI/ML model cards enabled by an interface called Model Context Protocol (MCP) within a software ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the dynamic nature of model cards for AI/ML models, focusing on how they are used over time rather than just during one-time assessment in training.

Method: The research involves quantitative and qualitative analysis, comparing the performance and overhead of MCP against a REST interface, and investigating the active session capabilities provided by MCP.

Result: Quantitative data evaluated the overhead caused by MCP versus REST, while qualitative insights addressed the relevance and fit of MCP for dynamic model card usage.

Conclusion: Dynamic model cards enabled by MCP provide unique functionalities; the adoption of such interfaces involves evaluating tradeoffs like performance overhead and active session support for practical utility.

Abstract: AI/ML model cards can contain a benchmarked evaluation of an AI/ML model against intended use but a one time assessment during model training does not get at how and where a model is actually used over its lifetime. Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.

*Dan Li,Hye-Bin Shin,Yeon-Woo Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL) framework to address forgetting issues in continual EEG decoding tasks, without storing historical EEG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of forgetting knowledge when continually dealing with new subjects in EEG decoding due to inter-subject variability, and to overcome the limitations of storing previous subjects' data due to privacy and memory constraints.

Method: ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to represent important information and aligns feature spaces across subjects using knowledge distillation and cross-subject feature alignment, removing the need for storing historical EEG data.

Result: The framework was validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, showing superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks, balancing retention and adaptability.

Conclusion: ProNECL is effective in preserving learnt knowledge and adapting to new subjects in EEG decoding tasks, without relying on access to prior data, addressing both privacy and memory challenges.

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

### [209] [On the Role of Hidden States of Modern Hopfield Network in Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20698)
*Tsubasa Masumura,Masato Taki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new attention mechanism called Modern Hopfield Attention (MHA) that integrates hidden states from Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) into Transformer self-attention to address issues like rank collapse and token uniformity, improving accuracy without increasing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental limitations in deep transformers, such as rank collapse and token uniformity, and to explore a generalized connection between MHN and self-attention.

Method: The authors propose MHA by adding hidden states derived from MHN to a self-attention mechanism. They analyze its theoretical implications and evaluate the performance of MHA in Vision Transformer and GPT architectures.

Result: MHA improves attention scores inheritance, mitigates rank collapse and token uniformity problems, and enhances model accuracy systematically without increasing the number of training parameters.

Conclusion: Integrating hidden states from MHN into Transformer self-attention enhances Transformer architectures while maintaining computational efficiency. This approach expands the relevance of Hopfield networks in deep learning.

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

*David Szczecina,Nicholas Pellegrino,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training followed by supervised training to improve robustness against noisy labels without requiring clean labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models with noisy labels leads to overfitting and reduced accuracy. Addressing this issue often requires clean subsets of data, which might not always be available.

Method: The paper uses self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (SimCLR and Barlow Twins) for pre-training a feature extractor, followed by supervised training on noisy datasets without requiring clean label subsets.

Result: Self-supervised pre-training consistently improves accuracy and the ability to detect label errors. It shows strong performance, especially under high noise conditions, surpassing even models pre-trained on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pre-training enhances robustness to label noise and offers a promising alternative to reliance on clean label subsets, especially in high noise scenarios.

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

*Chinmay Tripurwar,Utkarsh Maurya,Dishant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to recover accuracy in pruned DNN models without real data by leveraging synthetic images created using DeepInversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of degraded accuracy in globally pruned DNNs and the challenges posed by lack of access to original training data in privacy-sensitive domains.

Method: A Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework is proposed that generates synthetic images using DeepInversion of Batch Normalization (BN) statistics, enabling knowledge transfer from a teacher model to a pruned student network.

Result: The method successfully recovers lost accuracy in pruned networks across architectures such as ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG on CIFAR-10 without using real data.

Conclusion: The framework preserves data privacy while effectively mitigating accuracy loss due to model pruning, offering a viable solution for regulated domains.

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

*Anil K. Saini,Jose Guadalupe Hernandez,Emily F. Wong,Debanshi Misra,Jason H. Moore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores reweighting techniques to address bias in machine learning predictions by comparing different methods to assign weights to data points: genetic algorithm-based, dataset characteristic-based, and equal weighting. Experiments reveal genetic algorithms offer better trade-offs between fairness and predictive accuracy, but their benefits depend on the optimization objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in machine learning models that negatively affect marginalized communities, by investigating reweighting methods to improve fairness and predictive performance.

Method: The paper compares three weight generation methods: Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based evolution, dataset-characteristic-based calculation, and equal weight assignment, using predictive and fairness metrics across eleven datasets.

Result: Evolved weights using genetic algorithms yielded better trade-offs between fairness and predictive accuracy compared to other methods, especially when optimized for accuracy and demographic parity difference.

Conclusion: Reweighting through genetic algorithm can enhance fairness and predictive accuracy, contingent on well-chosen optimization objectives, showing promise in tackling biases in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Transformer-based framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, tackling challenges like limited data, heterogeneity, and class imbalance using synthetic data generation and graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited labeled data, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, which hinder reliable machine learning prediction models.

Method: A diffusion-model-based synthetic data generation is combined with Graph Transformer encoders and transfer learning to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The workflow involves creating synthetic datasets through class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models, pretraining Transformers on synthetic data, and training classifiers on real data.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior diagnostic performance compared to existing models, improving AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on the NACC dataset. Metrics such as MMD and Frechet confirm robust alignment between real and synthetic data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that diffusion-based synthetic data generation combined with Graph Transformer modeling enhances diagnostic outcomes in clinical settings plagued by low sample sizes and class imbalances.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

*Bilal Ahmed,Joseph G. Makin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePS is a framework designed for solving linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models, improving efficiency and reconstruction quality without requiring computationally expensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems are critical in science and engineering but are challenging due to incomplete or noisy measurements. Existing models using diffusion methods face various limitations, such as computational inefficiency or restrictions to linear settings.

Method: The authors introduce RePS, a restart-based sampling framework leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. It extends restart strategies to posterior inference, incorporates a conditioned ODE for differentiable models, and reduces approximation errors through simplified restarts, avoiding backpropagation.

Result: RePS achieves faster convergence and improved reconstruction quality across a diverse set of inverse problems, outperforming other diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: RePS offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for inverse problems, addressing limitations in previous approaches and demonstrating improved performance in both linear and non-linear contexts.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

*Minhui Zhang,Prahar Ijner,Yoav Wald,Elliot Creager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method called Active Slice Discovery to identify systematic errors in large language models efficiently, focusing on toxicity classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying specific subsets of data (error slices) where Large Language Models perform poorly, aiming to enhance model understanding and performance.

Method: The authors propose Active Slice Discovery, combining active learning algorithms with limited manual annotation to identify error slices, and empirically evaluate it using uncertainty-based active learning in toxicity classification.

Result: The method achieves competitive accuracy while using only 2-10% of the annotated slice membership information, outperforming baseline approaches in discovering systematic errors.

Conclusion: Active Slice Discovery is an effective approach to pinpoint error slices with minimal annotation effort, paving the way for better understanding and improving the performance of language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies instability issues in token-level PPO for multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks and introduces stabilization techniques for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability and performance collapses during training of large language models for multi-turn tasks due to misaligned optimization and inaccurate advantage estimates.

Method: The authors introduce turn-level importance sampling and clipping-bias correction techniques, alongside testing three PPO variants: Turn-PPO, S-PPO, and ST-PPO.

Result: Experiments on multi-turn QA tasks show that the proposed ST-PPO and S-PPO variants prevent performance collapses, reduce clipping ratios, and improve task performance over standard PPO.

Conclusion: Combining turn-level sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable method to stabilize large language model training in multi-turn environments.

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a high-fidelity scenario generation framework combining CVAE and LLM to improve autonomous driving safety validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of evaluating autonomous driving systems under rare, complex scenarios and interactions that are critical for safety validation.

Method: The framework integrates a CVAE for generating physically coherent base scenarios and an LLM for adversarial reasoning to optimize risk-sensitive and plausible traffic events.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in simulating high-risk, long-tail events and consistency with real-world traffic in CARLA and SMARTS environments.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a novel approach for testing autonomous systems under rare events, enhancing their robustness and safety validation.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHiQPM, a model offering comprehensive global and local interpretability with state-of-the-art accuracy and built-in conformal prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy AI requires interpretable models to support experts in safety-critical domains.

Method: CHiQPM provides hierarchical explanations, contrastive class-level explanations, and interpretable Conformal Prediction methods.

Result: CHiQPM achieves 99% accuracy comparable to non-interpretable models, while also improving prediction efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: CHiQPM demonstrates that globally and locally interpretable models can maintain high accuracy and enhance human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

### [221] [Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181)
*Dogukan Aksu,Jesus Martinez del Rincon,Ihsen Alouani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the privacy challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in federated learning, demonstrating that SNNs are less vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks compared to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the privacy challenge of gradient inversion attacks in federated learning, particularly focusing on the unexplored vulnerability of spiking neural networks (SNNs).

Method: The authors empirically study gradient leakage in SNNs by adapting gradient leakage attacks to the spiking domain and analyzing the reconstructed data's quality and privacy implications.

Result: The study finds that SNN gradients are less informative than ANN gradients, producing noisy and temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful input structure, due to their event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training.

Conclusion: SNNs demonstrate a strong potential for privacy-preserving computation, as their gradients are inherently less susceptible to revealing sensitive training data compared to ANNs.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

### [222] [Selecting Belief-State Approximations in Simulators with Latent States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20870)
*Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in state resetting for simulators with latent states, introducing a new algorithm and discussing implications for downstream roll-out methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State resetting empowers simulators to replicate real-world systems and improve decision-making processes but becomes challenging in simulators with latent variables.

Method: The authors reduce the problem to a conditional distribution-selection task, propose a new algorithm for sampling access, and examine two formulations: latent state-based and observation-based selection.

Result: They uncover the interaction of these formulations with downstream roll-out methods, revealing observation-based selection's potential limitations and advantages under different conditions.

Conclusion: This work highlights algorithmic challenges, theoretical considerations, and open questions in state resetting for complex simulators, paving the way for more effective simulator designs.

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

### [223] [Physics Steering: Causal Control of Cross-Domain Concepts in a Physics Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20798)
*Rio Alexa Fear,Payel Mukhopadhyay,Michael McCabe,Alberto Bietti,Miles Cranmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how scientific foundation models (focused on physics data) develop abstract representations and behaviors, and shows that manipulating these representations can steer model predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether foundation models exhibit internal abstract representations and steerable behavior beyond those trained on structured data like language or images.

Method: Activation vectors were extracted from the physics-focused foundation model during different simulations and used to compute delta representations. These delta tensors were tested for causal control by injecting them back into the model during inference.

Result: Injecting concept directions into the model allowed control over predictions, effectively inducing or removing specific physical features in simulations.

Conclusion: Scientific foundation models learn general representations of physical principles, rather than relying on surface-level correlations, paving the way for better interpretability and AI-driven scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

### [224] [Probabilistic Hash Embeddings for Online Learning of Categorical Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20893)
*Aodong Li,Abishek Sankararaman,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic hash embedding model to address issues with categorical feature embeddings in online learning, overcoming challenges like forgetting and order sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness and efficiency of embedding methods for streaming data with categorical features in online learning setups.

Method: They propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that employs Bayesian online learning, incorporating a scalable inference algorithm to handle evolving vocabularies and maintain efficiency.

Result: The PHE model outperforms deterministic embeddings in online learning, demonstrating advantages in performance and memory efficiency across various tasks.

Conclusion: Probabilistic hash embeddings offer a scalable, adaptive, and efficient solution for embedding categorical features in online learning scenarios, ensuring robustness to evolving and unbounded vocabularies.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

*Aaron O. Feldman,D. Isaiah Harp,Joseph Duncan,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven method to preemptively and reliably monitor flight safety during testing by predicting and classifying short-term risks using simulation and conformal prediction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure safety during flight testing, where uncertainties and risks require reliable criteria for pilots to preemptively abort unsafe maneuvers before they lead to safety violations.

Method: The approach involves offline stochastic trajectory simulation, prediction of future states from recent observations, nearest neighbor classification for safety, and classifier calibration through conformal prediction.

Result: The method successfully identifies unsafe scenarios reliably, meets theoretical safety guarantees, and outperforms baseline models in predicting and preemptively classifying risks during flight dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven framework effectively enhances preemptive safety monitoring under uncertainty and is applicable broadly beyond flight testing environments.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high decoding latency and limited scalability of LLM inference in heterogeneous edge-cloud environments.

Method: The method extends speculative decoding to multi-device environments using coordinated draft-target execution. It includes the development of DSD-Sim, a simulator for network, batching, and scheduling dynamics, and the Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy for dynamic optimization.

Result: DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput compared to existing speculative decoding techniques.

Conclusion: DSD enables more agile and scalable LLM inference in complex edge-cloud systems, overcoming limitations of current single-node speculative decoding techniques.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.

*Vitoria Barin-Pacela,Kartik Ahuja,Simon Lacoste-Julien,Pascal Vincent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose a method, named Cliff, aimed at achieving unsupervised disentanglement of quantized factors by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. The method outperforms baselines across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by a theoretical framework that establishes unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism but faces challenges when translating the principles into practical applications.

Method: The authors develop a criterion that focuses on inducing axis-aligned discontinuities, or 'cliffs,' in the estimated density of latent factors. They ensure these discontinuities are independent across factors, adhering to the theoretical definition of independent discontinuities.

Result: The proposed method, Cliff, demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods across all disentanglement benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cliff effectively advances unsupervised disentanglement by leveraging axis-aligned discontinuities in factor density, providing a practical implementation of theoretical principles.

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

*Nicholas Pellegrino,David Szczecina,Paul W. Fieguth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the Initial Guessing Bias in untrained large neural networks and examines the impact of loss functions on early training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand a phenomenon in untrained neural networks, Initial Guessing Bias, and its impact on training dynamics, particularly in the presence of label errors.

Method: The investigation focuses on analyzing two robust loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, in relation to Initial Guessing Bias and their ability to influence early training.

Result: The findings demonstrate that loss functions significantly affect early training dynamics and highlight limitations in robustness-related loss functions under this bias.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of carefully choosing loss functions to manage Initial Guessing Bias during early training stages of neural networks.

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

*Reza Mansouri,Dustin Kempton,Pete Riley,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new machine learning approach using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to predict solar wind radial velocity more efficiently and accurately than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting the solar wind's features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections are crucial for space weather forecasting. Current three-dimensional MHD models are computationally expensive, making it challenging to assess boundary condition uncertainties quickly.

Method: The authors developed an autoregressive machine learning model leveraging the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator. This model iteratively propagates solutions outward in the solar wind's radial velocity prediction, allowing for greater accuracy over larger radial ranges.

Result: The SFNO model outperformed or matched the accuracy of the HUX surrogate model while offering a data-driven, trainable alternative for solar wind modeling.

Conclusion: SFNO establishes a novel, efficient, and high-fidelity methodology for predicting solar wind behaviors, aiding in space weather forecasting and modeling flexibility.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for Ising model estimation in various settings, achieving polynomial-time algorithms with optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in Ising model estimation under specific settings, there remains a need for a unified framework to achieve computationally and statistically efficient estimation in Total Variation distance.

Method: The authors develop a unified analysis of MPLE for two broad classes of Ising models: those with bounded operator norm satisfying the MLSI and those with bounded infinity norm. Their approach employs tensorization inequalities, measure decompositions, and concentration bounds.

Result: The unified framework enables polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees for Ising model estimation in various structured settings.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a generalized and computationally effective methodology for estimating Ising models, advancing the field with significant improvements in both statistical and computational aspects.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Primal, a deterministic feature mapping approach utilizing prime square roots for creating robust, non-stochastic vector representations. It achieves better orthogonality and efficient performance, with its framework available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a robust deterministic alternative to random feature mappings, exploiting unique mathematical properties to improve computational efficiency and orthogonality while addressing key challenges in signal processing and transformation.

Method: The authors propose two deterministic algorithms, StaticPrime and DynamicPrime, that use prime square root properties for feature mapping. StaticPrime generates temporal position encodings, and DynamicPrime serves as a tunable projection layer utilizing a scaling parameter.

Result: Empirical results show Primal achieves better orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, offering practical benefits in signal reconstruction and privacy-preserving applications.

Conclusion: Primal is a reliable, mathematically grounded alternative to stochastic methods, excelling in efficiency, orthogonality retention, and broad applicability in signal processing, embeddings, and privacy-sensitive computing tasks.

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the safety-performance tradeoff in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and proposes RLVR, which can improve reasoning abilities while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the common trade-off where enhancing performance in LLMs often leads to safety degradation, even when benign datasets are used. It aims to investigate solutions for safe model fine-tuning.

Method: It uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to analyze safety properties, offering theoretical safety bounds and empirical experiments on multiple adversarial safety benchmarks.

Result: The study finds that RLVR can enhance reasoning abilities of LLMs while maintaining or improving safety, supported by experiments across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLVR challenges the belief of an unavoidable safety-capability tradeoff, showing it is possible to balance both, and offers a safe fine-tuning pathway for LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore tunable and efficient binary neural networks inspired by hyperdimensional computing, addressing challenges in robustness and accuracy of low-precision neural models.

Method: The authors develop G-Nets, which use randomized binary embeddings within a neural network framework to retain high accuracy while operating in the Hamming distance space of a hypercube.

Result: G-Nets achieve empirical performance comparable to convolutional neural networks and surpass traditional hyperdimensional computing methods, with notable improvements (e.g., 30% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10).

Conclusion: G-Nets provide a theoretically backed methodology for creating robust binary and quantized neural networks, offering a new approach that bridges neural networks with binary structures for practical and effective deep learning.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models.

Method: The paper defines representation integrity, proposes a family of indexes, selects a validated metric through theoretical and empirical tests, and applies it to evaluate models using synthetic scenarios and comparative analysis.

Result: The validated metric highlights the strengths of stable models such as UASE and IPP, quantifies scenario-specific advantages of neural methods, and correlates positively with performance on link-prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The integrity framework enhances the task-agnostic evaluation of dynamic-graph embeddings, aiding better model selection and design guidance.

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

### [235] [How to Correctly Report LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21140)
*Chungpa Lee,Thomas Zeng,Jongwon Jeong,Jy-yong Sohn,Kangwook Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a plug-in framework to correct bias and create confidence intervals for LLM evaluations, addressing issues caused by noisy judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly being used for evaluation tasks, but their imperfect specificity and sensitivity lead to biased accuracy estimates.

Method: The authors present a framework for bias correction along with confidence interval construction by accounting for uncertainties in both the test and calibration datasets. Additionally, they propose an adaptive calibration algorithm to optimize sample sizes.

Result: The framework effectively addresses bias correction and reflects uncertainties in accuracy estimations while the adaptive algorithm minimizes estimation uncertainty.

Conclusion: This work offers a statistically sound method for LLM evaluations, improving reliability and reducing bias in accuracy metrics through efficient calibration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

### [236] [Exploring Time-Step Size in Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20913)
*Yingchuan Sun,Shengpu Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores the impact of different time-step sizes on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management. It emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate time steps and suggests smaller time steps improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns have been raised that the typical 4-hour time-step size used in RL for sepsis management distorts patient dynamics and may result in suboptimal treatment policies, but the issue has not been thoroughly investigated.

Method: The researchers performed empirical comparisons of different time-step sizes (1, 2, 4, and 8 hours) in RL using an identical offline learning pipeline, action re-mapping methods, and cross-time-step model selection.

Result: The performance of the RL models varied across time steps, with the finest time steps (1 or 2 hours) providing the best performance and stability in policy learning when using a static behavior policy.

Conclusion: Time-step size is a critical factor in designing RL systems for healthcare, and finer time steps can outperform the conventional 4-hour setup, making it essential to consider alternatives in future RL studies for sepsis management.

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

*Yaw Osei Adjei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates two paradigms of Business Email Compromise (BEC) detection: one based on machine-learning psycholinguistics (CatBoost) and another on deep learning (DistilBERT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing economic impact of Business Email Compromise (BEC), where false negatives lead to significant financial losses compared to false positives.

Method: The paper evaluates two methods: CatBoost for psycholinguistic analysis and DistilBERT for semantic contextual understanding, benchmarking them on detection accuracy, latency, and resource costs.

Result: DistilBERT achieves high detection accuracy (AUC = 1.0000), but with higher latency and computational cost, while CatBoost provides competitive accuracy (AUC = 0.9905) at significantly lower latency and cost.

Conclusion: DistilBERT excels in environments with GPU resources, whereas CatBoost is ideal for low-cost or edge deployments. Both methods significantly reduce false negatives, yielding a financial ROI above 99.96%.

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

*Akansha Kalra,Soumil Datta,Ethan Gilmore,Duc La,Guanhong Tao,Daniel S. Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the robustness of Behavior Cloning (BC) policies to clean-label backdoor attacks, showing that poisoned datasets can lead to vulnerable policies despite high baseline task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of Behavioral Cloning policies under clean-label backdoor attacks, given their increasing deployment in real-world systems.

Method: Poisoning datasets of expert demonstrations with visual triggers to create spurious correlations, along with introducing an entropy-based test-time trigger attack targeting critical states.

Result: BC policies trained on minimally poisoned datasets maintain high baseline performance but are highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks when deployed.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets for real-world applications.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

### [239] [Subgoal Graph-Augmented Planning for LLM-Guided Open-World Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20993)
*Shanwei Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, SGA-ACR, to improve the practical utility of large language models (LLMs) in reinforcement learning (RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can plan tasks but often fail to propose actionable subgoals due to a lack of grounding in environment-specific knowledge and issues in self-verification of plans.

Method: The introduced SGA-ACR framework uses an environment-specific subgoal graph, structured entity knowledge, and a multi-LLM pipeline. It separates subgoal generation, critique, and refinement to enhance execution alignment.

Result: When tested on 22 tasks in the open-world game "Crafter," the SGA-ACR showed significant improvements in aligning planning and execution.

Conclusion: SGA-ACR fosters better planning-execution alignment in RL systems by combining structured knowledge integration and multi-LLM processing for reliable goal achievement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

*Jiaoyang Li,Jun Fang,Tianhao Gao,Xiaohui Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Chao Liu,Pengzhang Liu,Qixia Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FANoise, a feature-adaptive noise injection method for contrastive learning in multimodal representation learning, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in learning robust and generalizable representations and improve current noise injection methods by considering dynamic feature distributions.

Method: FANoise, a feature-adaptive noise injection strategy, leverages the dynamics of contrastive learning to enhance representation learning while minimizing noise-related drawbacks.

Result: FANoise consistently improves performance across multimodal representation learning tasks when tested on various vision and language models.

Conclusion: Feature-adaptive noise injection is a promising approach to enhance representation learning for multimodal tasks, as demonstrated by FANoise's consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a predictive safety shield for reinforcement learning that maintains safety and optimizes performance using safe environment simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guaranteeing safety in reinforcement learning for real-world tasks is challenging, as current safety approaches often neglect the future impact of safe actions.

Method: The approach uses a predictive safety shield in model-based RL that updates the Q-function locally using safe predictions derived from simulated environments.

Result: Experiments in gridworld environments show that even short prediction horizons can determine the optimal path while ensuring robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed shielding approach enhances performance with hard safety guarantees and adaptability without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

### [243] [Staggered Environment Resets Improve Massively Parallel On-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21011)
*Sid Bharthulwar,Stone Tao,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces staggered resets in reinforcement learning (RL) environments to address issues of nonstationarity caused by synchronous resets in massively parallel GPU simulation setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the destabilization in RL training caused by nonstationarity in short rollouts and high update-to-data (UTD) ratios, especially in massively parallel settings.

Method: The authors propose staggered resets, where environments reset at varied points in their task horizons, creating temporally diverse training batches and mitigating the effects of nonstationarity.

Result: The technique improves performance, with higher sample efficiency, faster convergence, and better scalability in high-dimensional robotics environments.

Conclusion: Staggered resets effectively address nonstationarity caused by synchronized rollouts, leading to improved outcomes in reinforcement learning with parallel environments.

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

### [244] [Gated KalmaNet: A Fading Memory Layer Through Test-Time Ridge Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21016)
*Liangzu Peng,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Luca Zancato,Elvis Nunez,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a model called Gated KalmaNet (GKA) that enhances performance on memory-intensive tasks by considering the full past during token prediction while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of linear state-space models (SSMs) in tasks requiring strong recall abilities, as they lose information over time due to their fading memory summary.

Method: GKA combines online ridge regression with adaptations inspired by the Kalman Filter. It introduces numerical stability via adaptive regularization and uses Chebyshev Iteration for efficient computation in low precision settings.

Result: GKA outperforms existing SSM layers on short-context tasks and delivers significant improvements in long-context tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long question-answering (LongQA) for sequences up to 128k tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed GKA balances efficiency and memory retention, addressing challenges of numerical instability and scalability, making it a strong alternative to existing SSM-based layers.

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

*Taehoon Kang,Taeyong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an autoregressive CGAN for wildfire spread prediction, offering better accuracy and long-term stability than conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rising wildfire frequency due to climate change, there is a need for rapid and precise predictions for effective response as existing models have computational inefficiencies or limited accuracy.

Method: The study uses an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to model wildfire spread by learning sequential transitions and leveraging adversarial learning for capturing nonlinear dynamics.

Result: The CGAN-based approach outperforms deep learning models in predictive accuracy and boundary delineation, demonstrating better handling of nonlinearity and uncertainties in wildfire spread.

Conclusion: The approach improves accuracy and interpretability of wildfire spread modeling, aiding effective planning and time-critical decisions.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial recommender systems face reduced long-term accuracy due to TDS and rely on periodic incremental training, which fails to efficiently capture both stable and transient patterns. Current methods like invariant learning and self-supervised learning come with drawbacks like unstable temporal generalization or inefficient data use.

Method: The authors propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$ framework integrating into industry-scale incremental pipelines, using statistical analysis for augmenting data and causal modeling to prevent representation collapse. Self-supervised variational objectives grounded in causal structure form the basis of the approach.

Result: The method demonstrates superior temporal generalization, achieving a 2.33% increase in GMV per user, and is deployed successfully in Shopee Product Search, backed by theoretical and empirical validation.

Conclusion: ELBO$_\text{TDS}$ effectively addresses limitations in existing methods, offers superior temporal generalization for recommender systems, and has proven industry-scale deployment success. Code is open-sourced for further exploration.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Motivation: Farmers need tools to identify resilient cows with better longevity to improve herd productivity and manage environmental and economic impacts.

Method: The study used data from 19,000 cows across 7 farms, applying Multi-Head Attention Transformers to analyse multivariate time-series information.

Result: The AI model achieved an 83% determination coefficient in predicting cows' herd life, showcasing high performance.

Conclusion: The developed AI model offers a promising solution for optimizing dairy herd management by accurately predicting cow resilience and longevity.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture effectively handles AMC tasks in noisy communication environments, displaying potential for applications like adaptive spectrum management and cognitive radio systems.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

*Jingtao Guo,Yuyi Mao,Ivan Wang-Hei Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedAPA, a federated learning algorithm for Wi-Fi sensing tasks that improves accuracy and reduces communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of deploying Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing systems at large scales due to the requirement of site-specific training data and device heterogeneity.

Method: The proposed method, FedAPA, integrates an adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy for similarity-based weighting of client data, enabling personalized learning. It also implements a hybrid objective combining classification learning with representation contrastive learning for better alignment.

Result: FedAPA is demonstrated to enhance accuracy, F1 score, reduce mean absolute error (MAE), and significantly lower communication overhead in a distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting experiment.

Conclusion: FedAPA effectively addresses heterogeneity in federated learning for Wi-Fi sensing tasks while significantly improving performance metrics and achieving personalization.

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

### [251] [Efficient Diffusion Planning with Temporal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21054)
*Jiaming Guo,Rui Zhang,Zerun Li,Yunkai Gao,Shaohui Peng,Siming Lan,Xing Hu,Zidong Du,Xishan Zhang,Ling Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) optimizes decision efficiency by updating plans iteratively rather than creating new ones, enhancing frequency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in traditional diffusion planning which rely on generating new plans per time step, causing computational overhead and performance issues.

Method: Introduce TDP, which initially formulates a plan with varying detail across time, updates it iteratively using fewer denoising steps, and leverages automated replanning to manage deviations.

Result: TDP improves decision frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving similar or better performance compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: TDP enhances decision-making efficiency and mitigates the drawbacks of frequent plan-switching through iterative updates and effective replanning.

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

*Quan Xiao,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses enhancing data quality for large language models (LLMs) through offline data selection and online self-refining generation using an optimization-driven approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt LLMs effectively to specific downstream tasks by improving data quality through well-designed offline and online processes.

Method: The method involves bilevel data selection for offline data selection and a model adaptation-based approach for online self-refining generation. It uses learned data weights assigned to questions and responses to enhance performance.

Result: Theoretically and experimentally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of bilevel data selection, achieving better results compared to unfiltered mixing baselines and improving fine-tuning in quality and safety-aware tasks.

Conclusion: By combining offline and online validation-weighted methods, this framework significantly improves LLM fine-tuning performance and data quality.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

*Zhenchao Tang,Fang Wang,Haohuai He,Jiale Zhou,Tianxu Lv,Jun Zhu,Shouzhi Chen,Minghao Yang,Yu Wang,Jiayang Wu,Yidong Song,Jianhua Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), a novel post-training method tailored for Large Language Models to improve their performance in biomedical tasks, addressing challenges like sparse data and overfitting seen in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to effectively internalize fragmented biomedical knowledge, while Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical due to challenges in defining rewards requiring prohibitive validation methods.

Method: The proposed BFT method uses a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1) token-level scaling of loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and manage overfitting, and 2) sample-level focus via 'minimum group confidence' to enhance learning on harder samples.

Result: Experiments show BFT outperforms SFT in both medical and biological tasks, enabling LLMs to learn complex reasoning. BFT-based LLMs also outperform existing tools like GeneAgent and produce embeddings applicable directly in downstream tasks such as gene interaction predictions.

Conclusion: BFT demonstrates enhanced capabilities in enabling LLMs to handle complex biomedical reasoning and applications, paving the way for broader applications in life sciences.

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

### [254] [Deceptron: Learned Local Inverses for Fast and Stable Physics Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21076)
*Aaditya L. Kachhadiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Deceptron, a bidirectional module for solving inverse problems more efficiently by learning a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate and enhancing optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems in physical sciences are often ill-conditioned, making optimization sensitive to step sizes. The paper aims to create a method to enhance convergence speed and accuracy in such scenarios.

Method: The Deceptron employs novel training techniques like supervised fitting, forward-reverse consistency, spectral penalties, soft bias ties, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty to ensure accurate transformations. It also integrates into a gradient-based optimization framework, D-IPG.

Result: On test cases like Heat-1D and Damped Oscillator inverse problems, D-IPG shows drastically fewer iterations compared to baselines, achieving competitive convergence efficiency. It also demonstrates improved tracking of composition error reductions.

Conclusion: The Deceptron improves iteration speed and cost-efficiency for solving ill-conditioned inverse problems in physical sciences, showing potential for broader applications and providing faster convergence benefits.

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

*Ivan Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MLPMoE, a method to restructure dense MLPs in transformers into sparse mixtures of experts without additional training or calibration, improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiencies in dense transformers, where all parameters are activated for every token, leading to high inference costs.

Method: Introduces MLPMoE—a deterministic, training-free transformation using simple tensor slicing and summation. Also presents Fractal Fade and Compensated Pruning for structured sparsity.

Result: MLPMoE maintains similar perplexity while reducing computational cost. On an 8B model, it retains perplexity within 2% of baseline while removing 20% of MLP parameters.

Conclusion: MLPMoE offers an efficient, post hoc transformation for dense transformers, improving computational efficiency without significant trade-offs in performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

*Seunghun Baek,Jaejin Lee,Jaeyoon Sim,Minjae Jeong,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hyperbolic geometry-based framework to improve neuroimaging meta-analysis by embedding brain activation data and text into a shared hyperbolic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the small sample size and limited reliability in neuroimaging studies, and to overcome limitations of traditional methods that overlook hierarchical brain structures.

Method: The proposed framework uses hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model to embed brain activation maps and text from research articles. It aligns these embeddings for semantic and hierarchical correspondence.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional baseline approaches and provides a robust and interpretable approach for neuroimaging meta-analysis.

Conclusion: The novel hyperbolic brain-text representation offers a more accurate, hierarchical, and interpretable method for analyzing and aggregating neuroimaging data.

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, which uses the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module to overcome limitations in capturing fine-grained user-item affinities in large-scale recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the effectiveness of Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems, which traditionally struggle to capture precise user-item interactions due to their decoupled representation design, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes GESR with MoA, incorporating Hard Matching Attention (HMA), Target-Aware Self Attention, and Cross Attention modules for enhanced user-item interaction modeling, refined by a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module. The approach is further optimized for efficiency through custom kernels and caching mechanisms.

Result: GESR demonstrated significant improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks through both offline and online experiments, showing its efficacy in ESR systems.

Conclusion: GESR represents a novel and effective solution to improving large-scale recommendation effectiveness in ESR systems, marking the first deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling at this scale.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

*Hengyu Fu,Baihe Huang,Virginia Adams,Charles Wang,Venkat Srinivasan,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new decoding strategy called Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE) for Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), aiming to overcome inefficiencies caused by reliance on high-confidence tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoding strategies for DLMs, which focus on high-confidence tokens, encounter bottlenecks that slow down generation due to information-theoretic constraints.

Method: The authors propose ETE, a training-free decoding strategy that incorporates cross-block decoding and exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape distributions and accelerate progress.

Result: ETE reduces the number of decoding rounds required compared to conventional confidence-based approaches while maintaining output quality, validated by both theoretical and experimental studies.

Conclusion: ETE demonstrates improved decoding efficiency in DLMs without compromising quality, providing insights into optimizing language model generation through better information throughput.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

*Robert Joseph George,Carson Eisenach,Udaya Ghai,Dominique Perrault-Joncas,Anima Anandkumar,Dean Foster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents BRIDGE, a framework for improving large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate verified programs, including code, specifications, and proofs. It achieves this through structured prompting and reasoning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in verified synthesis, particularly their challenges in integrating code generation with precise specifications and correctness proofs in frameworks like Lean4.

Method: BRIDGE uses structured prompting to decompose verification into three interlinked domains: code, specifications, and proofs. Distinct reasoning behaviors are utilized to enhance semantic alignment between these domains.

Result: BRIDGE significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs, increasing pass rates for formal language (e.g., Lean4) code and Python coding by up to 1.5x and 17.5%, respectively. It also reduces compute costs by improving efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: Structured domain alignment through approaches like BRIDGE is promising for advancing verified synthesis, laying the groundwork for further optimization and training strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic training framework to improve branching efficiency in solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with semantic variation in tree depths, data scarcity for upstream nodes, and costly sample collection during branching in MILPs.

Method: The proposed method groups branch-and-bound nodes based on feature distribution and employs a GCNN-based model for improved node representation. It introduces an augmented MILP derivation procedure for data scarcity challenges.

Result: The framework achieves improved branching accuracy, reduces time for solving MILPs, and shows better generalization on unseen instances.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses key challenges of MILP branching, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of interpretability in existing fair clustering methods, particularly in socially sensitive scenarios where transparency is crucial.

Method: The proposed approach integrates fairness directly into decision tree structures for clustering and offers a variant through post-pruning to avoid fairness hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets reveal competitive clustering performance, enhanced fairness, interpretability, and capability to handle multiple sensitive attributes.

Conclusion: The method provides a promising solution for equitable and transparent clustering, bridging fairness constraints and interpretable decision-making effectively.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

TL;DR: The paper discusses transitioning AI from centralized systems to decentralized, utilizing methods like cryptographic receipts and time-locked policies to address key compositional gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are centralized, limiting broader participation and scalability due to governance, economic, and accountability challenges.

Method: The authors propose cryptographic receipts for verification, geometric novelty for fair incentives, parallel ownership for scalability, and time-locked policies for governance improvements.

Result: The proposed approaches address compositional gaps in decentralized AI by improving accountability, scalability, and fairness while maintaining data privacy.

Conclusion: The work presents practical solutions to realize the democratic vision of distributed AI systems, overcoming significant centralization roadblocks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting drug effects lack adequate modeling of dependencies across biological hierarchies and suffer from incomplete data modalities.

Method: The study proposes CHMR, a framework utilizing local-global molecular-cellular dependencies and a tree-structured vector quantization module to model latent biological hierarchies.

Result: CHMR achieves significant improvements in classification (3.6%) and regression tasks (17.2%) over existing baselines across benchmarks of 728 tasks.

Conclusion: CHMR offers a generalizable and efficient framework for multimodal, biologically informed molecular property prediction, highlighting the importance of hierarchy-aware modeling.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Method: The framework employs RaPP-based HIs, augments them with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties using Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces, and introduces a method called I-GLIDE for interpretable sensor subset modeling.

Result: Evaluated on aerospace and manufacturing data, the framework demonstrates improved accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This work advances degradation modeling, improving robustness and actionable diagnostics in complex systems while bridging anomaly detection and prognostics.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finite Element Method (FEM) for seismic analysis is computationally intensive, and current deep learning models struggle to generalize and reliably capture seismic physics.

Method: Integration of Physics-Informed U-Net with LSTM, embedding domain-specific physical constraints into the deep learning process for enhanced prediction.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms conventional machine learning models in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency for seismic response analysis.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines physics-based modeling and data-driven methods, addressing scalability and reliability in seismic response prediction for resilient structural design.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates limitations in Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), highlighting issues of locality bias and performance degradation from mask tokens, and proposes a mask-agnostic loss function to improve their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and address their limitations, ultimately aiming to enhance their performance in processing global context.

Method: A detailed analysis of MDLMs' contextual understanding, systematic ablations showing the effects of mask tokens, and the development of a mask-agnostic loss function to improve robustness.

Result: The study revealed that MDLMs have a locality bias and are negatively impacted by large numbers of mask tokens. Fine-tuning with the proposed mask-agnostic loss substantially mitigates these issues.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into key limitations of MDLMs and introduces an effective training adjustment to enhance their context comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address AIRL's limitations in complex environments with sparse and imperfect rewards, such as poker, where reward inference is challenging.

Method: Proposes Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), which adds supervised loss from expert data and stochastic regularization to AIRL for better reward inference and policy learning.

Result: H-AIRL shows improved sample efficiency, stable learning, and better performance in tasks like poker compared to AIRL.

Conclusion: H-AIRL effectively extends AIRL for complex, real-world tasks, illustrating the usefulness of supervised learning in inverse reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity.

*Kevin Iselborn,David Dembinsky,Adriano Lucieri,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Directed Prediction Change (DPC), a deterministic and faster metric for evaluating fidelity in local feature attribution methods, especially for high-stakes settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for faithful explanations in machine learning models is critical, especially in medical and regulatory contexts where transparent and accurate reasoning is required.

Method: The paper modifies the existing Prediction Change metric into Directed Prediction Change (DPC), leveraging both direction of perturbation and attribution in the Guided Perturbation Experiment to eliminate randomness and improve efficiency.

Result: The results, based on extensive evaluations across datasets, models, algorithms, and hyperparameters, show that DPC provides faster, deterministic, and reproducible fidelity evaluations.

Conclusion: DPC significantly advances the fidelity evaluation of feature attribution methods, offering trustworthy and efficient metrics that cater to high-stakes applications.

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effectiveness of multimodal data for accurate, real-time disaster classification, filling gaps in Bangla-focused disaster analysis.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

*Ben Anson,Laurence Aitchison*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses stability in neural network transformer models by proposing a learning rate adjustment method for query and key weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving stability in transformer models, especially addressing the growth of query and key weights which are not addressed effectively by existing methods like QK norm in certain settings.

Method: Introduces parameter-dependent learning rates for query and key weights to stabilize changes to logits.

Result: The proposed method enables increased base learning rate, better performance in MLA settings, and competitive results with QK norm in Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: The adjustment of parameter-specific learning rates is a simple, effective solution for stability in transformer models where QK norm cannot be applied.

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two Transformer (TF) variants, Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), which utilize Bayesian surprise for dynamic computation, achieving significant efficiency in processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in standard Transformers, especially for large-scale models and long sequences, by creating architectures that dynamically allocate computation based on data novelty or prediction demand.

Method: The authors introduce SDT, which uses Decision and Dynamic layers with Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise, and STT, which employs temporal 'change hypothesis' to route computation by dynamically executing or bypassing TF blocks.

Result: SDT and STT architectures reduce self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% per compute-skipping layer while aligning with Bayesian principles during their operation.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures provide a flexible, efficient framework for Transformers, achieving a balance between compute efficiency and accuracy and setting the foundation for scalable future models.

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in anomaly detection with contaminated training data by proposing Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), which uses adaptive thresholds to balance excluding anomalies and retaining normal data, delivering superior performance on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenges arising from contaminated datasets in anomaly detection, where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap, and fixed contamination ratios used in traditional methods degrade performance.

Method: The proposed method AAR dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and thresholds based on a Gaussian mixture model. It combines hard and soft rejection strategies to adaptively handle anomalies.

Result: Experiments show that AAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better performance by 0.041 AUROC across image and tabular datasets.

Conclusion: AAR provides a scalable and robust solution for handling contaminated datasets in anomaly detection, with potential applications in domains like healthcare and security.

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs) which combine deep learning and polynomial advantages for efficient function approximation with fewer parameters, achieving better results compared to DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing function approximation methods (DNNs and KANs) require a large number of parameters, leading to limitations like reduced transparency, optimization challenges, and sensitivity to initialization, which motivate the development of more efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors propose SUPNs, which replace the majority of hidden layers in neural networks with a single layer of polynomials featuring learnable coefficients, balancing expressivity and parameter efficiency. They provide theoretical convergence guarantees and derive quasi-optimal parameters.

Result: The experiments on over 13,000 models across various dimensions show that SUPNs achieve lower approximation error, reduced variability, and often outperform DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection, even on non-smooth functions.

Conclusion: SUPNs offer a pragmatic and theoretically sound approach to function approximation, providing improved efficiency and performance over traditional methods while reducing parameter demands.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to determine the optimal ensemble size for classifiers by analyzing the linear independence of classifier votes in data streams. Validation via experiments confirms the theoretical estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between enhancing classification accuracy through ensemble learning and the computational inefficiency caused by excessively large ensembles.

Method: The authors analyze the relationship between ensemble size and performance under a geometric model, focusing on linear independence among classifiers. They derive theoretical estimates of ensemble size based on probabilities of achieving linear independence and validate this through experiments.

Result: The study identifies the optimal ensemble size for performance saturation in robust methods like OzaBagging. For methods with complex weighting (e.g., GOOWE), findings reveal high diversity may lead to instability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for balancing ensemble size and performance. It helps optimize ensemble configurations for different learning methods while identifying the risk of instability in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

### [281] [Lost in Time? A Meta-Learning Framework for Time-Shift-Tolerant Physiological Signal Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21500)
*Qian Hong,Cheng Bian,Xiao Zhou,Xiaoyu Li,Yelei Li,Zijing Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShiftSyncNet, a framework addressing temporal misalignments in multimodal signal transformation (e.g., PPG to ABP). This system enhances signal accuracy by learning and correcting time shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformation techniques for physiological signals are limited by temporal misalignments, which degrade accuracy in capturing critical parameters like arterial blood pressure peaks. Current methods either overly discard data or can't sufficiently resolve time-shift issues.

Method: The paper proposes ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based optimization framework. It uses two networks: TransNet for signal transformation and SyncNet for time-shift correction, leveraging Fourier phase shifts to align signals automatically.

Result: Evaluations using one industrial dataset and two public datasets showcase ShiftSyncNet's superiority, improving performance by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ShiftSyncNet successfully mitigates temporal misalignments, enhancing label quality and transformation precision in physiological signal data. It offers a promising step towards unified solutions for multimodal signal alignment challenges.

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

*Wanli Zhong,Haibo Feng,Zirui Zhou,Hanyang Peng,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces IntAttention, a fully integer-based attention mechanism for Transformers, to improve latency and energy efficiency on edge devices without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the latency and energy inefficiency of softmax operations in INT8-quantized Transformer models, which disrupt integer dataflow and become a bottleneck for edge device performance.

Method: The paper introduces IntAttention, featuring IndexSoftmax, which operates entirely in the integer domain. Techniques like sparsity-aware clipping, a lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization are employed to eliminate the floating-point-related inefficiencies.

Result: IntAttention achieves up to 3.7x latency speedup and 61% energy savings compared to FP16 baselines and is 2.0x faster than standard INT8 attention mechanisms on Armv8 CPUs, all while maintaining high model accuracy.

Conclusion: This fully integer attention pipeline demonstrates practical gains in speed and energy efficiency, making it viable for deploying Transformer models on edge devices without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on understanding transformer models in time series classification using interpretability techniques adapted from NLP, uncovering causal structures within the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of the internal decision-making mechanisms of transformer models in time series classification and to expand interpretability techniques to these models.

Method: The authors adapted Mechanistic Interpretability techniques, including activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformers for time series classification. They systematically analyzed attention heads and timesteps, constructing causal graphs and identifying important components.

Result: The study uncovered causal roles of attention heads and timesteps, built causal graphs illustrating information propagation, and showed how sparse autoencoders identify interpretable latent features in models.

Conclusion: The research advances transformer interpretability methods, providing insights into their internal mechanisms and enhancing understanding of their performance in time series classification.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

*Martin Rabel,Jakob Runge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a modular framework for analyzing causality in spatially and temporally variable data using modified constraint-based causal discovery methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatially and temporally varying patterns in real-world data are crucial both for understanding the system and to address issues with stability and validity in causal discovery algorithms.

Method: The researchers analyze causality by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches and independence testing, enabling adaptability and modularity in dealing with challenges of varying causal structures.

Result: The framework integrates with existing causal discovery algorithms while being extensible by leveraging other techniques like clustering and change-point detection, improving accessibility and interpretability.

Conclusion: Their proposed modular approach simplifies causal analysis of spatially and temporally varying systems, enabling systematic understanding and extendibility, with an open-source implementation forthcoming.

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of strategic classification, proposing a novel method to compute best responses in non-linear classifier settings using Lagrangian dual optimisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for strategic classification focus mainly on linear classifiers, which limit their applicability in complex scenarios requiring non-linear classifiers.

Method: The authors propose optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective to compute the best responses, extending applicability to non-linear classifiers.

Result: The method reproduces best responses in linear settings and demonstrates effectiveness for training and evaluating non-linear classifiers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves the ability to handle non-linear classifiers in strategic classification, resolving the challenge of computing best responses.

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

*Wei-Chen Chang,Lu Dai,Ting Xu*

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) for enhancing disease risk prediction from EHR data by addressing challenges like temporal irregularities and sampling differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle challenges in EHR data such as temporal irregularity, varying sampling intervals, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies, which hinder accurate risk prediction models.

Method: The method employs a learnable temporal alignment mechanism, multi-scale convolutional feature extraction, and attention-based aggregation to model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR data, ultimately creating fine-grained risk representations.

Result: Experiments on public EHR datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model over mainstream baselines in multiple metrics, showing its effectiveness for medical time-series analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed MSTAN model provides an intelligent solution to represent high-dimensional asynchronous EHR sequences, enabling improved clinical risk prediction and health status assessment.

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel and simple kernel method for predicting cell-membrane permeability of cyclic peptides using Gaussian Processes, outperforming state-of-the-art models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of limited public data and lack of well-calibrated uncertainty in predicting cell-membrane permeability of cyclic peptides.

Method: The method introduces MD-GAK, a kernel based on residue-residue similarity and sequence alignment (decoupling local matches from gap penalties) and PMD-GAK, a variant with a triangular positional prior, applied within the Gaussian Process framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MD-GAK and PMD-GAK outperform state-of-the-art models in various metrics, particularly in accuracy and uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective and robust for predicting cyclic peptide properties, emphasizing its simplicity, reproducibility, and superior performance in uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

TL;DR: Latent reasoning in Transformer models compresses reasoning lengths by using latent states and introduces reinforcement learning for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency in Transformer language models by reducing dependency on human language tokens and compressing reasoning lengths.

Method: Adaptive-length latent reasoning models were developed, supplemented by reinforcement learning to optimize lengths while retaining accuracy.

Result: Experiments using the Llama 3.2 1B model on the GSM8K-Aug dataset showed a 52% reduction in reasoning length without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Latent reasoning models optimize reasoning efficiency and computational cost, with potential for broader applications and further improvements.

Abstract: Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities in smart grids due to their integration with advanced communication networks.

Method: Implement an all-in-one cloud-based forensic framework using ML algorithms for anomaly detection, event reconstruction, and intrusion analysis.

Result: Demonstrates framework accuracy and resilience to cyber-attacks through simulation studies.

Conclusion: Cloud services enable fast and intelligent forensic workflows in smart grid systems, enhancing cybersecurity.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

TL;DR: The paper conducts dimensionality reduction analysis of Transformer-based models, revealing novel geometric patterns in latent states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to improve understanding of the internal mechanisms of large language models, which currently achieve high performance but remain hard to interpret.

Method: Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and UMAP are used on layerwise activations captured at multiple Transformer block points in GPT-2 and LLaMa models.

Result: The paper identifies unique geometric features such as separation between attention and MLP outputs, layerwise latent state evolution, and high-dimensional helical structure of positional embeddings.

Conclusion: The findings aim to advance systematic interpretability research of Transformer internals and are supported by code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research. We make our code available at https://github.com/Vainateya/Feature_Geometry_Visualization.

*Hans Gundlach,Alex Fogelson,Jayson Lynch,Ana Trisovic,Jonathan Rosenfeld,Anmol Sandhu,Neil Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the large gains in AI training efficiency over 2012-2023, attributing most of the gains to algorithms' improvements at a large computational scale, especially the transition from LSTMs to Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant gap between the claimed AI training efficiency improvement (22,000x) and the measurable gains in small-scale algorithm innovations (<100x). The study aims to explain this discrepancy.

Method: The research uses small-scale ablation studies, scaling experiments comparing LSTMs and Transformers, and extrapolation of efficiency estimates from experiments and literature.

Result: Scaling experiments demonstrated that most AI efficiency improvements are scale-dependent, particularly with the LSTM-to-Transformer transition yielding a major share of efficiency gains (6,930x).

Conclusion: Algorithmic efficiency for small models has been slower than believed, and efficiency measures vary greatly based on computational scale. Future measures must consider scale-dependence for accurate assessments.

Abstract: Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.

TL;DR: The paper examines the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structures in neural networks during training on MNIST-digit classification, demonstrating their spontaneous appearance across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric structures observed in shallow networks extend to high-dimensional realistic tasks and their spatial properties.

Method: Using MNIST data, the authors analyzed the emergence of KAG structures in 2-layer MLPs through systematic spatial analysis at local and global scales, employing multiple training procedures.

Result: KAG structures emerged consistently across spatial scales, from local pixel neighborhoods to full images, exhibiting scale-invariance across standard and augmented training methods.

Conclusion: Neural networks naturally develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structures during training on high-dimensional data, suggesting deeper insights into neural learning patterns.

Abstract: Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.

*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deeper Vision Transformers often underperform compared to shallower ones due to how representation evolves with depth, following a consistent Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deeper Vision Transformers do not always improve performance and identify patterns in their representations.

Method: Empirical analysis of Vision Transformers (ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L) using ImageNet and the Information Scrambling Index to quantify representation changes.

Result: Deeper architectures show delayed phase transitions and increased information diffusion without proportional task performance gains.

Conclusion: Optimal transformer depth should focus on phasing transitions rather than increasing parameters, and the Information Scrambling Index serves as a diagnostic and design tool for model improvements.

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative PPO, a method to optimize large language models for multi-turn conversational tasks by reducing them to single-turn RLHF-style problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in optimizing goal-oriented conversational AI due to sparse rewards and the conflict between response planning and token-level generation.

Method: Propose a reduction of multi-turn RL to single-turn problems using a learned multi-turn Q-function as a reward model and implement an Iterative PPO algorithm.

Result: Iterative PPO facilitates stable implementation by leveraging existing RLHF tools and balances adaptability of online updates with stability of offline training.

Conclusion: The approach bridges online and offline training techniques, ensuring an improved policy for multi-turn conversational AI tasks.

Abstract: Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study and quantify reward hacking behaviors in programming agents, aiming to improve robustness and alignment.

Method: EvilGenie incorporates testing with LiveCodeBench problems, LLM reviewers, held out tests, and detection of file edits to measure reward hacking.

Result: Codex and Claude Code exhibited explicit reward hacking behaviors, while all three studied agents showed some misaligned actions. LLM judges proved effective at detecting reward hacking.

Conclusion: Reward hacking detection methods, especially LLM judges, are promising but still require further refinement. The studied coding models showed misaligned behaviors.

Abstract: We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.

*Locke Cai,Ivan Provilkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RARO, a method for training reasoning abilities in language models without relying on task-specific verifiers, by using expert demonstrations through Inverse Reinforcement Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many reasoning-focused tasks lack task-specific verifiers even though they may have abundant expert demonstrations. Existing approaches fail to fully utilize these expert demonstrations for reasoning training.

Method: The proposed method, RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization), employs an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator). It uses Inverse Reinforcement Learning to mimic expert reasoning without needing verifiers.

Result: RARO notably surpasses strong verifier-free baselines in tasks like Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing, showing comparable scaling trends to RL on tasks with verifiers.

Conclusion: RARO demonstrates that strong reasoning capabilities can be effectively learned solely from expert demonstrations, ensuring robust reasoning learning even in the absence of task-specific verifiers.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: Despite remarkable technological advances, AI systems may still benefit from biological principles, such as recurrent connectivity and energy-efficient mechanisms. Drawing inspiration from the brain, we present a biologically plausible extension of the eligibility propagation (e-prop) learning rule for recurrent spiking networks. By translating the time-driven update scheme into an event-driven one, we integrate the learning rule into a simulation platform for large-scale spiking neural networks and demonstrate its applicability to tasks such as neuromorphic MNIST. We extend the model with prominent biological features such as continuous dynamics and weight updates, strict locality, and sparse connectivity.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm to optimistically analyze cyclic programs using a unified abstract interpretation during equality saturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficacy of current e-class analysis in handling cyclic programs limits optimization for SSA-form programs.

Method: Proposes an abstract interpretation algorithm that handles cycles within equality saturation and includes a prototype for SSA programs.

Result: The prototype demonstrates better precision in analyzing SSA programs compared to clang and gcc.

Conclusion: The unified algorithm improves program analysis in cyclic SSA programs while enhancing optimization techniques.

Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.

### [300] [Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209)
*Yee-Jian Tan,Andreas Nuyts,Dominique Devriese*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper explores implementing h-Set Cubical Type Theory in Cubical Agda by addressing unsatisfying current methods and experimenting with a variant without Glue to support UIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in implementing h-Set Cubical Type Theory in Cubical Agda, particularly addressing the difficulties with the preservation of functional extensionality and Quotient Inductive Types while aligning with the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate.

Method: Analysis of UIP formulations, detailed computation rules for Cubical Agda, and the development of a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, making it compatible with postulated UIP.

Result: Evaluation of UIP formulations and the successful creation of a modified Cubical Agda variant without Glue, paving the way for future UIP implementation.

Conclusion: The study provides a pathway for achieving h-Set Cubical Type Theory in Cubical Agda by addressing computational challenges and developing compatible modifications for implementing UIP in the future.

Abstract: Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.
  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.

*Dirk Beyer,Gidon Ernst,Martin Jonáš,Marian Lingsch-Rosenfeld*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SV-LIB, a unified format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks aimed at facilitating technology transfer across programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification tools developed so far are often tailored to individual programming languages despite using language-agnostic approaches. There is a need for a standardized format to enable technology sharing across different tools and languages.

Method: The authors propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language built on concepts from imperative programming and SMT-LIB for expressions, aiming at seamless integration with existing verification infrastructure.

Result: The paper presents version 1.0 of SV-LIB, detailing its design goals, syntax, and informal semantics, while outlining plans for future updates including formal semantics and concurrency support.

Conclusion: SV-LIB enhances interoperability among verification tools by providing a standardized format to bridge various programming languages, with plans for further development in future versions.

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OVAL-Grasp is a zero-shot, open-vocabulary grasping method using language and vision-language models to enable robots to reliably identify, segment, and grasp task-specific object parts, even under occlusions and for unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometry-based robotic grasping methods struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and novel objects, limiting their effectiveness in unstructured environments.

Method: OVAL-Grasp utilizes large-language models (LLMs) to identify parts to grasp or avoid according to a given task, vision-language models (VLMs) for segmentation, and creates a heatmap of actionable regions for grasping.

Result: OVAL-Grasp achieved a 95% success rate in identifying and segmenting correct object parts, 78.3% in grasping actionable areas in real-world experiments, and maintained an 80% part selection rate under cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: OVAL-Grasp demonstrates strong task-oriented grasping capabilities, leveraging modular design and LLM/VLM integration to exceed baseline performances, making robots adaptable to real-world and visually complex environments.

Abstract: To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current teleoperation systems struggle with force feedback, cross-embodiment adaptability, and user-friendliness, inhibiting their practical usage.

Method: ACE-F utilizes inverse kinematics, human-robot interfaces, virtual force signal interpretation for force feedback, and a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics.

Result: Experiments show ACE-F simplifies controlling diverse robots and supports intuitive dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: ACE-F enhances robot manipulation by integrating precise control, force feedback, and cross-embodiment adaptability, advancing teleoperation and imitation learning.

Abstract: Teleoperation systems are essential for efficiently collecting diverse and high-quality robot demonstration data, especially for complex, contact-rich tasks. However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

*Vivek Pandey,Amirhossein Mollaei,Nader Motee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes two efficient feature selection algorithms to enhance robot localization by evaluating the utility of visual features in real-time, reducing time and memory complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient robot localization in unknown environments is challenged by the computational inefficiencies of processing redundant or uninformative visual features in image frames.

Method: Two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms are introduced to select the most informative visual features for localization in real time.

Result: The algorithms achieve a favorable balance between computational efficiency and localization accuracy, outperforming existing high-demand methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods simplify robot localization by intelligently selecting features to optimize both computational speed and accuracy while reducing memory usage.

Abstract: Robot localization is a fundamental component of autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DA-SIP improves robotic control by dynamically adjusting computational resources for diverse tasks, achieving efficiency gains while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of robotic controllers with fixed computational budgets, especially when handling tasks of varying complexity.

Method: DA-SIP employs a difficulty classifier to adaptively select the integration horizon, solver variants, and type of integration at each control cycle based on task difficulty.

Result: DA-SIP achieves a 2.6-4.4x reduction in computation time while maintaining similar task success rates compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: DA-SIP creates more efficient and task-aware robotic controllers, smartly allocating resources to ensure high performance across varying task complexities.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AerialMind, a benchmark for referring multi-object tracking in UAV scenarios, along with a novel tracking method, HawkEyeTrack, and an efficient labeling framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RMOT technologies are limited to ground-level perspectives, restricting their scene analysis and tracking capabilities. UAVs’ aerial view expands surveillance but lack advanced RMOT frameworks for natural language interaction.

Method: The authors developed AerialMind, a UAV benchmark utilizing a semi-automated labeling framework (COALA) and proposed HawkEyeTrack (HETrack) for improved vision-language representation learning.

Result: Experiments validated the dataset's challenging nature and demonstrated HawkEyeTrack's effectiveness in UAV RMOT scenarios.

Conclusion: AerialMind and HawkEyeTrack together address UAV RMOT limitations, enabling more robust perception and natural language-based object tracking in aerial contexts.

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.

*Feiyang Pan,Shenghe Zheng,Chunyan Yin,Guangbin Dou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) framework utilizing reinforcement learning policies to improve efficiency and accuracy without relying heavily on computationally intensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIO methods face a trade-off between efficiency (filter-based) and accuracy (optimization-based), making them impractical for resource-constrained platforms.

Method: The method uses lightweight reinforcement learning agents: a Select Agent to manage the visual odometry pipeline using high-frequency IMU data, and a composite Fusion Agent for adaptive state estimation and fusion.

Result: The proposed system achieves superior accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-offs, runs up to 1.77 times faster, and uses less GPU memory compared to prior methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach fosters efficient and accurate VIO, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive techniques, suitable for resource-limited platforms.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a critical component for robust ego-motion estimation, enabling foundational capabilities such as autonomous navigation in robotics and real-time 6-DoF tracking for augmented reality. Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory. Compared to classical optimization-based VIO systems, our approach maintains competitive trajectory accuracy while substantially reducing computational load.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring embodied navigation systems can understand and adhere to social norms, which is crucial for real-world deployment.

Method: SocialNav uses a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, works with the SocNav Dataset comprising reasoning signals and trajectory demonstrations, and employs imitation learning followed by a custom reinforcement learning framework called SAFE-GRPO.

Result: SocialNav outperforms existing methods, achieving a +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate in navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively integrates social norms into navigation intelligence, advancing the field with higher success and compliance rates in embodied navigation.

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Motivation: Current non-contact manipulation techniques are limited to microscopic scales, motivating the need for systems capable of handling larger objects in industrial applications.

Method: The authors optimized electromagnet arrangements using numerical analysis, implemented deep reinforcement learning for flexible control, and proposed an action remapping method to improve convergence amid magnetic field nonlinearities.

Result: Experimental results show flexible manipulation capabilities, including untrained transport tasks, with potential scalability for heavier objects.

Conclusion: The system provides a scalable solution to non-contact manipulation challenges, paving the way for broader industrial robotics applications.

Abstract: Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.

Motivation: The lack of datasets and benchmarks for robotics research in complex commercial environments, as most focus on simpler household or tabletop settings.

Method: MarketGen uses a Procedural Content Generation framework with multimodal input support to create virtual supermarkets, offering tasks like Checkout Unloading and In-Aisle Item Collection.

Result: MarketGen provides a functional simulation platform validated through experiments, modular agent deployment, and sim-to-real transfer analysis.

Conclusion: MarketGen can promote advancements in embodied AI research by addressing dataset gaps and enabling benchmarking in commercial scenarios.

Abstract: The development of embodied agents for complex commercial environments is hindered by a critical gap in existing robotics datasets and benchmarks, which primarily focus on household or tabletop settings with short-horizon tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce MarketGen, a scalable simulation platform with automatic scene generation for complex supermarket environments. MarketGen features a novel agent-based Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework. It uniquely supports multi-modal inputs (text and reference images) and integrates real-world design principles to automatically generate complete, structured, and realistic supermarkets.

*Kaiyan Xiao,Zihan Xu,Cheng Zhe,Chengju Liu,Qijun Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based framework for humanoid robots to perform high-load industrial tasks with enhanced locomotive and manipulative capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid robot methods lack the combination of dexterity and proactive force interaction required for high-load industrial applications.

Method: A decoupled three-stage training pipeline is proposed, featuring upper-body, lower-body, and delta-command policies. It includes heuristic reward functions for faster convergence and curriculum learning for force regulation.

Result: The framework allows humanoid robots to learn effective loco-manipulation skills, especially geared towards high-load tasks.

Conclusion: The developed approach bridges the gap in humanoid robotics, advancing their capability to handle challenging industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like morphology, hold great potential for industrial applications. However, existing loco-manipulation methods primarily focus on dexterous manipulation, falling short of the combined requirements for dexterity and proactive force interaction in high-load industrial scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework with a decoupled three-stage training pipeline, consisting of an upper-body policy, a lower-body policy, and a delta-command policy. To accelerate upper-body training, a heuristic reward function is designed. By implicitly embedding forward kinematics priors, it enables the policy to converge faster and achieve superior performance. For the lower body, a force-based curriculum learning strategy is developed, enabling the robot to actively exert and regulate interaction forces with the environment.

### [313] [Dual Preintegration for Relative State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21189)
*Ruican Xia,Hailong Pei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dual preintegration method for relative state estimation between mobile agents, improving precision and reducing errors caused by nonlinear rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in relative state estimation, particularly in VR applications, due to cumulative linearization errors during rapid rotations of reference platforms.

Method: A dual preintegration method is proposed, combining IMU preintegration from both platforms. Observability analysis and simulations/experiments evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method demonstrates improved precision and robustness under challenging nonlinear rotations and VR controller tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: The technique enhances estimation accuracy and consistency, offering reliable performance for applications like VR controller tracking with significant state estimation challenges.

Abstract: Relative State Estimation perform mutually localization between two mobile agents undergoing six-degree-of-freedom motion. Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for manipulating fabric pieces often fail to ensure accurate placement and texture alignment, requiring a robust and effective solution.

Method: The paper implements a dual-arm manipulator driven by a combination of Transformer-driven visual servoing and dual-arm impedance control. A newly proposed Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM) enhances pose difference prediction, with a network trained solely on synthetic images for zero-shot real-world application.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrate the system's ability to successfully align fabric pieces with varying textures, validating the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective way to align fabrics accurately using advanced AI techniques, enabling practical applications in real-world scenarios without fabric-specific training.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based methods in dual-arm manipulation struggle with generalizing to novel environments, especially cluttered spaces.

Method: Developed a GPU-accelerated Model Predictive Path Integral Control algorithm, leveraging task-specific cost functions and MuJoCo for fast robot-object interactions.

Result: The framework successfully solves complex bimanual tasks, achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs, and enables sim-to-real transfer while providing statistical analysis of sample complexity and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods in handling challenging robotic tasks in cluttered environments, enabling real-time application and robustness across scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, dual-arm manipulation has become an area of strong interest in robotics, with end-to-end learning emerging as the predominant strategy for solving bimanual tasks. A critical limitation of such learning-based approaches, however, is their difficulty in generalizing to novel scenarios, especially within cluttered environments. This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo. The paper concludes with a statistical analysis of the sample complexity and robustness, quantifying the performance of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robust and mapless navigation in complex and unknown environments for aerial robots, ensuring collision avoidance and handling challenges like limited sensing range and odometry drift.

Method: A novel neural architecture encodes range images into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). This SDF-based position constraint is integrated into a velocity-tracking NMPC, generating safe thrust and attitude commands for the robot.

Result: The framework achieves theoretical guarantees (feasibility and stability) and demonstrates robust collision-free navigation in simulations and forest environment experiments, even against adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: Neural NMPC is effective for real-world, mapless navigation of aerial robots, addressing challenges of unknown terrains while providing robust collision avoidance and handling odometry drift.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for mapless, collision-free navigation in unknown environments with Aerial Robots, using onboard range sensing. We leverage deep neural networks to encode a single range image, capturing all the available information about the environment, into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry. The real-world experiments are conducted in forest environments, demonstrating that the neural NMPC effectively performs collision avoidance in cluttered settings against an adversarial reference velocity input and drifting position estimates.

TL;DR: The paper introduces E0, a discrete diffusion framework for robotic manipulation tasks, improving generalization, action control, and robustness over existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models struggle with task generalization, stable actions, and adapting to diverse conditions in robotic manipulation settings.

Method: The authors propose E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework, which leverages discrete action tokens for symbolic alignment and introduces spherical viewpoint perturbation for robustness. This approach aligns with real-world discrete robot control systems.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill demonstrate that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baselines by an average of 10.7%. A real-world test on a Franka arm showed robust, precise, and transferable manipulation capabilities.

Conclusion: E0 establishes discrete diffusion as a superior method for generalizable VLA policy learning, presenting promising advancements in robotic manipulation and policy design.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel robotic manipulation system integrating a two-finger gripper and vacuum suction unit to handle diverse tasks, overcoming limitations of traditional grippers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-finger grippers used in Vision Language Action (VLA) systems struggle with tasks requiring greater contact area or adhesion (e.g., wiping surfaces or opening drawers without handles).

Method: Design and implementation of a low-cost hybrid end effector combining a two-finger gripper and vacuum suction unit that can switch or synergize between modalities.

Result: The hybrid system, tested on DexVLA and Pi0 frameworks, enabled successful execution of complex tasks infeasible for standard two-finger grippers, validating its practicality.

Conclusion: This innovative dual-mode end effector expands the capabilities of robotic manipulation and will be shared for broader use.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of E2E autonomous driving models, such as cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop scenarios, by enhancing their robustness and adaptability.

Method: Propose MPA, which uses a simulation engine to generate counterfactual trajectories, trains a diffusion-based policy adapter, and employs a multi-step Q value model to select high-utility trajectory candidates during deployment.

Result: MPA shows significant improvements in performance across various scenarios (in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical) on the nuScenes benchmark in a closed-loop simulator.

Conclusion: MPA effectively enhances the robustness and performance of pretrained E2E driving agents, particularly by leveraging counterfactual data and advanced inference-time strategies.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.

*Lorenzo Shaikewitz,Charis Georgiou,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a novel method to calculate distribution-free uncertainty bounds for pose estimation without requiring strict distributional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide statistically rigorous uncertainty bounds for pose estimation, especially in monocular settings, as existing methods often rely on restrictive assumptions.

Method: The authors propose SLUE, a convex program based on the S-lemma, to compute ellipsoidal uncertainty bounds and also present a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy for improved accuracy.

Result: The proposed SLUE method achieves smaller translation uncertainty bounds and competitive orientation bounds on two pose datasets and one real-world drone tracking task.

Conclusion: SLUE provides reliable and tight uncertainty estimates for pose estimation, outperforming prior methods in key scenarios, and is supported by publicly available code.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TraceGen, a model predicting 3D scene traces for task learning across robots and environments, achieving high performance with minimal data while using videos of diverse embodiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of learning new robot tasks in varied platforms and scenes with limited demonstrations, leveraging abundant cross-embodiment videos that are hindered by differences in embodiment, environment, and camera perspectives.

Method: The method involves creating a symbolic representation (trace-space) of 3D scene trajectories. TraceGen predicts motion in this trace-space, and TraceForge converts diverse human and robot videos into these consistent representations. This enables pretraining and adaptability.

Result: TraceGen achieves 80% success in tasks using only five robot videos or 67.5% from five human demo videos, showcasing effective cross-environment and cross-embodiment task learning with faster inference compared to previous models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that TraceGen's symbolic 3D trace-space approach successfully handles the small-data challenge in robot task learning across diverse environments, embodiments, and camera setups, enabling scalable and efficient adaptability.

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.

TL;DR: DUALGAUGE is a framework for evaluating the security and correctness of LLM-generated code jointly, paired with a curated benchmark suite, addressing gaps in secure code generation evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for secure code generation fail to jointly assess security and functionality, leaving a crucial requirement unmet for effective coding by LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces DUALGAUGE, an automated benchmarking framework featuring an agent program executor and LLM-based evaluator, and a tailored dataset (DUALGAUGE-BENCH) focusing on both security and functionality.

Result: DUALGAUGE was tested on ten leading LLMs across extensive scenarios, revealing significant deficiencies in secure and correct code generation.

Conclusion: The research establishes DUALGAUGE as a critical tool for advancing secure and correct code generation via reproducible evaluations, potentially guiding improvements in LLM coding capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents are increasingly used to generate software across a wide range of domains. Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation and uncertainties in the integration of data-driven methods into product development, particularly regarding their appropriate types, timing, and applications across development stages.

Method: A PRISMA systematic literature review of 1,689 records collected from Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014-2024), analyzed using the V-model framework simplified into four phases: system design, implementation, integration, and validation.

Result: The study found that machine learning and statistical methods dominate, with increasing adoption of deep learning. Key challenges include limited interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Validation-stage contributions are notably limited.

Conclusion: This review identifies trends, limitations, and opportunities for using DDMs in engineering design. It emphasizes the need for interpretable hybrid models and calls for further mapping of computer science algorithms to design problems to create stage-specific guidelines.

Abstract: The increasing availability of data and advancements in computational intelligence have accelerated the adoption of data-driven methods (DDMs) in product development. However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities.

Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of managing engineering infrastructure reconstruction programs through adaptive decision-making tools and machine learning-based system modeling.

Method: The model utilizes system modeling and machine learning, specifically neural networks, for predicting objective function values. Input data includes decision-maker preferences, tasks, and historical datasets, implemented via Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.

Result: The adaptive model supports tailored decision-making for program reconstruction goals across various engineering systems (e.g., heat, gas, water supply), with demonstrated efficacy in neural network evaluation.

Conclusion: The model provides a robust framework for improving reconstruction program management, leveraging predictive capacities of machine learning and adaptive parameter redistribution.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe an adaptive decision-making support model aimed at improving the efficiency of engineering infrastructure reconstruction program management in the context of developing the architecture and work breakdown structure of programs. As part of the study, the existing adaptive program management tools are analyzed, the use of infrastructure systems modelling tools is justified for program architecture and WBS creation. Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals. The functional composition done in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is described. The neural network parameters and evaluation results are given. The application of the developed adaptive model is possible in the management of programs for the reconstruction of such engineering systems as systems of heat, gas, electricity supply, water supply, and drainage, etc.

### [328] [Hierarchical Evaluation of Software Design Capabilities of Large Language Models of Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20933)
*Mootez Saad,Boqi Chen,José Antonio Hernández López,Dániel Varró,Tushar Sharma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how large language models understand software design concepts like cohesion and coupling, finding performance differences due to context and guidance. Cohesion reasoning proves more robust than coupling in noisy, open-ended scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the robustness of large language models in understanding core software engineering concepts, identifying their limitations in practical and noisy contexts.

Method: The paper examines LLMs systematically using programmatically generated poorly designed code fragments, testing their reasoning abilities under guided and open-ended scenarios with varying contextual noise.

Result: Models exhibit solid understanding in ideal settings but face significant performance degradation, especially in coupling reasoning under noisy and open-ended conditions.

Conclusion: While LLMs can identify software design flaws reliably in guided contexts, their autonomous reasoning capabilities in realistic situations remain inadequate, highlighting the need for improved program understanding frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly adopted in the software engineering domain, yet the robustness of their grasp on core software design concepts remains unclear. We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module). We programmatically generate poorly designed code fragments and test the DeepSeek-R1 model family ($14$B, $32$B, $70$B) under varying levels of guidance, from simple \textit{Verification} to \textit{Guided} and \textit{Open-ended Generation}, while varying contextual noise by injecting distractor elements. While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion. To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Composite Productivity Score utilizing the SPACE framework and advanced statistical tools to map developer productivity in open-source repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of simplistic productivity heuristics in software development by proposing a multidimensional metric.

Method: The study uses repository mining, GLMM, sentiment analysis with RoBERTa, and collaborative topology mapping.

Result: Negative emotional states correlate with higher commit frequencies, and collaborative topology analysis provides improved dynamics mapping.

Conclusion: A Composite Productivity Score is proposed as a refined measure of developer productivity, emphasizing holistic analysis over traditional methods.

Abstract: This empirical investigation elucidates the limitations of deterministic, unidimensional productivity heuristics by operationalizing the SPACE framework through extensive repository mining. Utilizing a dataset derived from open-source repositories, the study employs rigorous statistical methodologies including Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and RoBERTa-based sentiment classification to synthesize a holistic, multi-faceted productivity metric. Analytical results reveal a statistically significant positive correlation between negative affective states and commit frequency, implying a cycle of iterative remediation driven by frustration. Furthermore, the investigation has demonstrated that analyzing the topology of contributor interactions yields superior fidelity in mapping collaborative dynamics compared to traditional volume-based metrics. Ultimately, this research posits a Composite Productivity Score (CPS) to address the heterogeneity of developer efficacy.

### [330] [Lightweight Model Editing for LLMs to Correct Deprecated API Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21022)
*Guancheng Lin,Xiao Yu,Jacky Keung,Xing Hu,Xin Xia,Alex X. Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the problem of outdated knowledge in LLMs concerning deprecated APIs, proposing and validating the AdaLoRA-L method to enhance API update effectiveness while maintaining specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models for coding tasks often generate deprecated APIs due to outdated training data and lack computationally affordable methods to update this knowledge effectively.

Method: The study evaluates 10 model editing techniques using EDAPIBench (benchmark with over 70 deprecated APIs and 3,000 editing instances) and proposes AdaLoRA-L, which separates LLM layers into "Common API Layers" and "Specific API Layers" for focused editing.

Result: AdaLoRA was identified as the best initial performer for API updates but had limitations in specificity. AdaLoRA-L improved specificity significantly while maintaining comparable performance across other metrics.

Conclusion: AdaLoRA-L effectively updates LLMs to generate up-to-date APIs while addressing unintended knowledge influences, offering a promising direction for lightweight model editing in AI code generation.

Abstract: Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines "Common API Layers" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to "Specific API Layers" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.

*M. Alecci,P. Jiménez,J. Samhi,T. Bissyandé,J. Klein*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes geographic disparities in Android app behavior by studying location-based variations in permissions, libraries, and functionality—raising security and fairness concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the largely unexplored geographic variations in mobile app behavior and their implications for security, fairness, and ethics.

Method: The researchers implemented a distributed app collection pipeline across multiple regions, analyzing thousands of apps and introducing a dataset of 81,963 "GeoTwins" apps for further research.

Result: The findings reveal systemic geographic discrepancies in Android apps, including differences in permissions, third-party libraries, APK files, and privacy disclosures, which influence app assessment outcomes.

Conclusion: These variations introduce ethical and security-related concerns, undermine reproducibility, and highlight the need for greater transparency and alignment in mobile app ecosystems across regions.

Abstract: While mobile app evolution has been widely studied, geographical variation in app behavior remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.
  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.
  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps. We also release a dataset of 81,963 GeoTwins to support future work. Our findings reveal systemic regional disparities in mobile software, with implications for researchers, developers, platform architects, and policymakers.

TL;DR: This paper examines developers' mental models of AI-assisted bug detection and code readability tools through co-design workshops, proposing design principles to improve trust and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers perceive AI-assisted development tools and identify factors influencing trust and adoption for effective implementation in IDEs.

Method: Six co-design workshops with 58 developers were conducted to elicit mental models regarding AI-assisted bug detection and readability assessment tools.

Result: Developers see bug detection tools as 'bug detectives' focusing on critical issues with transparency and actionable feedback, while readability tools are 'quality coaches' providing personalized, contextual, and progressive guidance.

Conclusion: The study identifies key factors—clear explanations, timing, and user control—that influence trust and proposes human-centered AI design principles to balance automation and human agency in IDEs.

Abstract: AI-assisted tools support developers in performing cognitively demanding tasks such as bug detection and code readability assessment. Despite the advancements in the technical characteristics of these tools, little is known about how developers mentally model them and how mismatches affect trust, control, and adoption. We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues. Readability assessment tools, on the other hand, are envisioned as \textit{quality coaches}, which provide contextual, personalized, and progressive guidance. Trust, in both tasks, depends on the clarity of explanations, timing, and user control. A set of design principles for Human-Centered AI in IDEs has been distilled, aiming to balance disruption with support, conciseness with depth, and automation with human agency.

*Jingyi Chen,Xiaoyan Guo,Songqiang Chen,Shing-Chi Cheung,Jiasi Shen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates multi-agent systems driven by LLMs, such as GitHub Copilot, for automating software engineering artifact adaptation, highlighting both their current limitations and potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of exploration into automating software engineering artifact adaptation across datasets, focusing on scalability and reproducibility using LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Method: An empirical study using GitHub Copilot, powered by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, was conducted. Evaluations were performed across a five-stage pipeline, with prompt-based interventions to enhance system performance.

Result: Current LLM systems demonstrate partial success in adapting SE artifacts but struggled to deliver correct implementations. Prompt interventions improved structural similarity from 7.25% to 67.14%.

Conclusion: Today's LLM-based multi-agent systems hold promise but lack full reliability for adapting SE artifacts. Further development of self-correcting mechanisms is needed to enhance their performance.

Abstract: Automating the adaptation of software engineering (SE) research artifacts across datasets is essential for scalability and reproducibility, yet it remains largely unstudied. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research.

TL;DR: The paper surveys using Large Language Models (LLMs) for unit test generation, introducing a taxonomy, identifying current strategies like prompt engineering, and proposing future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated unit testing methods often miss semantic insights, and LLMs offer potential to fill this gap by leveraging their knowledge of programming patterns and semantics.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications (May 2021-August 2025) and developed a taxonomy analyzing the unit test generation lifecycle with LLMs.

Result: Prompt engineering dominates as the main strategy (89% of studies). Iterative validation/repair loops improve test quality, but challenges include weak fault detection and lacking evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for industrial-grade unit testing, but need advancements in fault detection and benchmarks. The paper outlines directions for hybrid systems merging LLMs and traditional tools.

Abstract: Unit testing is an essential yet laborious technique for verifying software and mitigating regression risks. Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools. This survey provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on converting the potential of LLMs into industrial-grade testing solutions.

*Wu-Fei Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper studies the AdEx model, analyzing its firing patterns using phase plane analysis and demonstrating its capability to simulate six distinct neuronal patterns under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to comprehensively understand and analyze diverse neuronal firing patterns in the AdEx model and their dynamic mechanisms, with potential applications in neuroscience and technology, such as neuromorphic computing.

Method: The authors used phase plane analysis combined with numerical simulations to investigate how the parameters of the AdEx model influence its six representative firing patterns under different input conditions.

Result: The study identifies that the AdEx model can effectively reproduce six firing patterns: Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Bursting, Transient Spiking, and Delayed Spiking, showcasing its versatility.

Conclusion: The AdEx model provides a robust framework for understanding neuronal behavior and has significant implications for neuromorphic computing and brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: The Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) model is a simplified framework that effectively characterizes neuronal electrical activity. The aim of this paper is to employ phase plane analysis to systematically investigate diverse firing patterns generated by the AdEx model under varying parametric conditions. We first introduce the fundamental equations and parameter configurations of the AdEx model to numerically simulate the six representative firing patterns in the AdEx model. And then we use phase plane analysis to explore the dynamic mechanism of these firing patterns under different input currents and parametric conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the AdEx model can simulate multiple firing patterns, including Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Busting, Transient Spiking and Delayed Spiking firing patterns. These results not only advance the understanding of complex electrophysiological phenomena in neurons but also provide theoretical foundations for applications in many fields like neuromorphic computing and brain-computer interfaces.

TL;DR: This paper proposes embedding moral processing directly into the architectural mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) rather than relying solely on traditional fine-tuning or reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring that LLMs can process moral meaning is crucial, as these models increasingly mediate human decision-making and behavior.

Method: The authors propose using a top-down design approach based on embedding moral reasoning into the architecture of LLMs, inspired by Iris Murdoch's concept of loving attention and making technical suggestions involving training objectives, runtime adjustments, and architectural modifications.

Result: They present a conceptual framework viewing attention as a dynamic system and offer technical ideas for implementing moral reasoning directly in LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Embedding moral reasoning within LLM architectures can complement existing methodologies, and collaboration between AI ethicists and model designers is essential for progress.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.

*Valentina Sánchez,Çiçek Güven,Koen Haak,Theodore Papamarkou,Gonzalo Nápoles,Marie Šafář Postma*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes from fMRI data to capture both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions using information-theoretic measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods fail to capture the higher-order synergistic interactions characteristic of neural complexity.

Method: The framework constructs combinatorial complexes using information-theoretic measures like O-information and S-information computed from neural time series data.

Result: The proposed framework successfully captures pairwise and higher-order dependencies in fMRI data, demonstrated through NetSim simulations.

Conclusion: The work enables a brain network representation that accommodates higher-order neural structure, supporting applications of topological deep learning to neuroscience.

Abstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses SSVEPs and adaptive visual stimuli to reconstruct imagined shapes. Results show enhanced performance leveraging symbiotic human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive BCIs require improvement in capability while reducing hardware requirements to progress into functional clinical and assistive technologies.

Method: The system uses visual probes flickering at different frequencies, analyzes SSVEPs with adaptive Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies for image reconstruction, and employs stable diffusion models for realistic transformations, using single-channel EEG data.

Result: The proposed method reconstructs simple imagined shapes within two minutes and increases BCI bit rates by over 5x, demonstrating practicality and improved efficiency.

Conclusion: The work showcases human-AI collaboration enhancing BCI performance, providing a foundation for further development of AI-augmented BCIs for clinical and assistive use.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are evolving from research prototypes into clinical, assistive, and performance enhancement technologies. Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how neural dynamics can transition toward criticality during meditative states, using EEG and physiologic measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if volitional attention self-regulation, specifically during meditation, can influence the neural balance between order and chaos.

Method: The authors conducted a 10-day retreat study on experienced meditation practitioners with EEG, physiological recordings, and perturbational sensitivity tests, comparing jhana states to regular mindfulness of breathing.

Result: Jhana states exhibited unique neural dynamics: increased neural diversity, reduced chaoticity, slower respiration, sensory fading, and heightened deviance detection.

Conclusion: Criticality may act as a neurophysiological marker for the absorptive and minimal-content dimension of meditative states like jhana.

Abstract: Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information processing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.

*Alejandro Tabas,Heike Sönnichsen,Sandeep Kaur,Marco Meixner,Katharina von Kriegstein*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigates how the brain detects the absence of sensory stimuli and identifies a neural mechanism for absence detection using the human auditory system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain detects the presence or absence of sensory stimuli and differentiate it from the detection of unexpected stimulus features.

Method: Utilized a human auditory model with fMRI to test the hypothesis of a distinct absence prediction error signal encoded in sensory pathways.

Result: Absence prediction error was found to be encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex but not earlier in the auditory midbrain, highlighting a unique circuit for absence-related signals.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence for a distinct neural mechanism for detecting sensory absence, potentially playing a role in disorders like psychosis.

Abstract: How does the brain know what is out there and what is not? Living organisms cannot rely solely on sensory signals for perception because they are noisy and ambiguous. To transform sensory signals into stable percepts, the brain uses its prior knowledge or beliefs. Current theories describe perceptual beliefs as probability distributions over the features of the stimuli, summarised by their mean and variance. Beliefs are updated by feature prediction errors: the mismatch between expected and observed feature values. This framework explains how the brain encodes unexpected changes in stimulus features (e.g., higher or lower pitch, stronger or weaker motion). How the brain updates beliefs about a stimulus' presence or absence is, however, unclear.
  We propose that the detection of absence relies on a distinct form of prediction error dedicated to reducing the beliefs on stimulus occurrence. We call this signal absence prediction error. Using the human auditory system as a model for sensory processing, we developed a paradigm designed to test this hypothesis. fMRI results showed that absence prediction error is encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex, indicating that absence is explicitly represented in subcortical sensory pathways. Moreover, while feature prediction error is already encoded in the auditory midbrain, absence prediction error was not, implying that absence-related error signals are supported by a different circuit.
  These results identify a neural mechanism for the detection of sensory absence. Such mechanisms may be disrupted in conditions such as psychosis, where predictions about absence and presence are impaired.

*Arshya Pooladi-Darvish,Heather Rosehart,Marina R. Everest,Ali R. Khan,Sarah A. Morrow*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on cognitive impairment in MS, identifying specific brain regions associated with information processing speed deficits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relative contribution of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy to cognitive impairment, particularly information processing speed (IPS), in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Method: A retrospective cohort study with 100 MS participants used automatic segmentation techniques to quantify lesion load and analyze the association between thalamic regions of interest (ROIs) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance, with lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models.

Result: Significant associations were found between SDMT performance and volumes of 21 out of 26 thalamic ROIs before lesion adjustment. After adjustment, 12 regions remained significant. Vulnerable nuclei showed lower lesion-mediated effects compared to others (13.4% vs 34.2%, p<0.001).

Conclusion: Lesion-independent thalamic atrophy contributes to IPS impairment through heterogeneous regional effects. Identifying nucleus-specific vulnerabilities may help recognize individuals at higher risk for cognitive impairment in MS.

Abstract: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both focal inflammation and compartmentalized neurodegeneration, yet the relative effect of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on information processing speed (IPS) remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These intrinsically vulnerable nuclei exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogenous contributions from both primary and secondary degeneration, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.

### [342] [When Features Beat Noise: A Feature Selection Technique Through Noise-Based Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20851)
*Mousam Sinha,Tirtha Sarathi Ghosh,Ridam Pal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel feature selection method to address limitations of existing techniques, incorporating bootstrap-based hypothesis testing and outperforming benchmark methods in simulated and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection remains challenging due to increasingly high-dimensional datasets and limitations in existing methods, such as high computational cost, lack of statistical stopping criteria, and heavy reliance on heuristics.

Method: The proposed method uses random noise features and a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to evaluate feature importance against maximum noise feature importance, establishing solid theoretical grounding.

Result: Through simulated datasets and real-world benchmarks, the method demonstrated stronger recovery of meaningful signals compared to Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, with superior practical performance metrics against techniques like Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees.

Conclusion: The method is a robust solution for feature selection, enabling reliable inference, improved predictive performance, and computational efficiency, surpassing other established techniques.

Abstract: Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.

### [343] [Deep Learning as a Convex Paradigm of Computation: Minimizing Circuit Size with ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20888)
*Arthur Jacot*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores how deep neural networks (DNNs) succeed by effectively implementing a computational Occam's razor, favoring simpler models that fit data efficiently. Specifically, it analyzes the connection between their complexity optimization approaches and circuit theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the extraordinary performance of DNNs compared to traditional statistical models, the paper investigates if their results can be attributed to their ability to identify the simplest models that fit the data.

Method: The study defines and relates two types of norms (HTMC and ResNet) that quantify function and parameter complexities in neural networks. It demonstrates how ResNet-based computations effectively minimize these norms, optimizing model simplicity and efficiency.

Result: The research identifies a parallel between ResNet norm minimization and designing circuits with nearly minimal nodes. DNNs achieve this through a balance of complexity and approximation under certain mathematical regimes.

Conclusion: ResNets serve as an advanced computational model optimized for specific regimes (HTMC), where simplicity and efficiency are prioritized, helping explain DNNs' broad success.

Abstract: This paper argues that DNNs implement a computational Occam's razor -- finding the `simplest' algorithm that fits the data -- and that this could explain their incredible and wide-ranging success over more traditional statistical methods. We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $ε$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $cε^{-γ}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $γ>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.

### [344] [Geometric Calibration and Neutral Zones for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20960)
*Soumojit Das,Nairanjana Dasgupta,Prashanta Dutta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of probability outputs in neural networks, leveraging the Fisher--Rao metric for principled multi-class calibration and reliability assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of neural networks often failing silently under uncertainty and the need for principled calibration methods, especially in critical decision-making tasks.

Method: The authors use the Fisher--Rao metric to create Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that extend Platt scaling to multi-class problems. They also introduce reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and propose neutral zones for handling uncertain predictions.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 72.5% capture of errors while deferring 34.5% of predictions in Adeno-Associated Virus classification. Theoretical guarantees include consistency of calibration estimation and concentration bounds for reliability scores, enabling practical validation.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between information geometry and statistical learning, providing a rigorous calibration and reliability framework with theoretical underpinnings. The framework is generally applicable to problems requiring reliable prediction confidence.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.
  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.

### [345] [Nonconvex Penalized LAD Estimation in Partial Linear Models with DNNs: Asymptotic Analysis and Proximal Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21115)
*Lechen Feng,Haoran Li,Lucky Li,Xingqiu Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores LAD regression for partial linear models, utilizing DNNs with penalized LAD estimation and addressing theoretical and computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LAD regression by incorporating DNNs for better modeling, while tackling statistical and computational challenges in high-dimensional, nonconvex optimization.

Method: Using penalized LAD regression guided by DNNs with theoretical analysis, introducing variational and nonsmooth analysis alongside proximal subgradient methods.

Result: Achieved consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator, along with insights into the trade-offs between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The introduced methodology bridges advanced theoretical designs and practical computational frameworks, demonstrating effective estimation techniques despite inherent challenges.

Abstract: This paper investigates the partial linear model by Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression. We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.

*Jasraj Singh,Shelvia Wongso,Jeremie Houssineau,Badr-Eddine Chérief-Abdellatif*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper adapts variational inference (VI) to possibility theory, redefining key concepts for better handling of epistemic uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable variational inference in the realm of possibility theory, allowing robust and interpretable modeling under uncertain or imprecise data.

Method: The authors formulate a principled approach to possibilistic variational inference and demonstrate its application to certain exponential-family functions.

Result: The study reveals parallels with probabilistic VI while uncovering unique mathematical structures of possibility theory.

Conclusion: Possibilistic VI provides a robust alternative to probabilistic VI, especially under conditions of sparse or imprecise information, offering new insights and methodological advancements.

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.

### [347] [Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities (II)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21526)
*Alexandra Carpentier,Christophe Giraud,Nicolas Verzelen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the computational barrier for community recovery in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) when the number of communities exceeds √n, proving it is possible above a specific threshold by motif counting rather than spectral methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the conditions under which community recovery in SBM is possible, particularly for the case of many communities (K ≥ √n), building upon recent breakthroughs and filling gaps in computational barriers.

Method: The authors construct motifs with specific structural properties and demonstrate that counting such motifs allows community recovery above the newly proposed threshold by Chin et al.

Result: The paper proves that community recovery above the computational barrier is achievable in SBM with K ≥ √n, completing theoretical understanding in this domain.

Conclusion: This work resolves open conjectures about community recovery thresholds in dense SBM setups and suggests that optimal algorithms differ fundamentally from conventional spectral methods in moderately sparse regimes.

Abstract: A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.
  When $K \geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \geq \sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.
  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \geq \sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods.

### [348] [On Evolution-Based Models for Experimentation Under Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21675)
*Sadegh Shirani,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a way to estimate causal effects in networked systems without requiring exact network structure knowledge, focusing on outcome evolution and spillover effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying causal effects in networked systems where interactions and spillovers between units are often unobserved.

Method: Develops an evolution-based approach using exposure-mapping to study changes in outcomes across time after interventions, and establishes structural conditions for its validity.

Result: Demonstrates that treatment randomization aids in learning about spillover effects, even without full network information, and applies the method to dense and influencer networks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a new way to estimate causal effects under certain conditions, though strong temporal trends or endogenous interference may limit its effectiveness.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a statistical framework for measuring similarity and alignment between high-dimensional datasets with underlying low-dimensional manifold structures, even in the presence of noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in high-dimensional datasets necessitates robust methods to compare data distributions, especially for those supported on low-dimensional manifolds, addressing challenges like separating meaningful signals from noise.

Method: The authors use a manifold signal-plus-noise model, analyze sample covariance spectra, and develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on principal variance structures. They also propose a consistent estimator and statistical test for manifold alignability, with analysis via random matrix theory.

Result: The proposed framework effectively handles heterogeneous noise across datasets and achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared to existing methods. This was validated through simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient and theoretically grounded solution for comparing high-dimensional datasets supported by low-dimensional manifolds, addressing noise and achieving better performance than existing approaches.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets across various scientific domains has created a pressing need for new statistical methods to compare distributions supported on their underlying structures. Assessing similarity between datasets whose samples lie on low-dimensional manifolds requires robust techniques capable of separating meaningful signal from noise. We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures. We further introduce a consistent estimator for this distance and a statistical test for manifold alignability, and establish their asymptotic properties using random matrix theory. The proposed framework accommodates heterogeneous noise across datasets and offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach for comparing high-dimensional datasets with low-dimensional manifold structures. Through extensive simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations.

Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.

Motivation: To address the computational challenges posed by the multiscale characteristics of heterogeneous porous media when applying conventional numerical methods in reservoir simulations.

Method: A dual-domain deep learning framework is developed that extracts and decodes permeability field features in frequency and spatial domains to generate multiscale basis functions efficiently within the MGMsFEM framework.

Result: The proposed method significantly accelerates the computation of multiscale basis functions while maintaining high approximation accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising solution for improving computational efficiency in addressing heterogeneous porous media, with potential applications in real-world reservoir engineering.

Abstract: In energy science, Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media is a central problem in reservoir sim-ulation. However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unmet need for suppressing seizures in patients with medically refractory epilepsy, thereby reducing economic and psychological burdens.

Method: The researchers used fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, performed multi-scale analysis, and simulated controlled signals to suppress seizure activity across various epileptic states.

Result: The method successfully stabilized seizures in 34 out of 35 episodes, reduced signal amplitude by 49%, and distinguished epileptic states using stability properties in fractal behavior.

Conclusion: Fractional dynamics are effective in characterizing seizure-related brain states and have significant potential for suppressing epileptic activity.

Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus makes their identification crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung Disease, highlighting the need for precise, automated solutions to improve accuracy and reduce variability.

Method: A three-stage segmentation framework leveraging Vision Transformers (ViT-B/16) was developed to mimic the diagnostic approach of pathologists, with tailored post-processing and anatomical consistency ensured.

Result: The method demonstrated high accuracy in segmenting muscularis propria (Dice coefficient: 89.9%, Plexus Inclusion Rate: 100%), myenteric plexus (Recall: 94.8%, Precision: 84.2%, Ganglia Inclusion Rate: 99.7%), and ganglion cells (Precision: 62.1%-67.0%, Recall: 89.1%).

Conclusion: The ViT-based segmentation framework proved effective in complex histological tissue structures, with potential to enhance digital pathology workflows, supporting diagnosis and reducing observer variability in Hirschsprung Disease evaluation.

Abstract: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the origin of Zipf's law in language, which has been debated across disciplines.

Method: Developed the Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) to simulate word formation and analyze rank-frequency distributions based on geometric principles.

Result: The model aligns with Zipf-like behavior observed in real-world languages, supported by simulations and comparisons with data from English, Russian, and mixed genres.

Conclusion: Zipf-like distributions in language stem from basic geometric constraints in word formation rather than communicative efficiency or linguistic factors.

Abstract: Zipf's law in language lacks a definitive origin, debated across fields. This study explains Zipf-like behavior using geometric mechanisms without linguistic elements. The Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) forms words from a finite alphabet, generating a geometric distribution of word lengths. Interacting exponential forces yield a power-law rank-frequency curve, determined by alphabet size and blank symbol probability. Simulations support predictions, matching English, Russian, and mixed-genre data. The symbolic model suggests Zipf-type laws arise from geometric constraints, not communicative efficiency.

*Karen Jia-Hui Li,Simone Balloccu,Ondrej Dusek,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study conducted the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in nutrition and found that while they perform well intrinsically, their real-world impact shows inconsistent benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, including nutrition, but their applications lack extrinsic evaluations via robust methods such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The researchers enhanced a rule-based nutrition chatbot with LLM-driven features like message rephrasing for engaging conversations and nutritional counseling through fine-tuned models. They conducted a seven-week RCT, comparing chatbots with and without LLM integration, measuring outcomes on dietary habits, emotional well-being, and engagement (n=81 participants).

Result: The LLM-integrated chatbot performed well in intrinsic evaluations; however, it did not consistently improve dietary, emotional, or engagement metrics in real-world settings.

Conclusion: There exists a disconnect between promising intrinsic evaluations of LLMs and their real-world effectiveness. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary, human-centered design for impactful applications.

Abstract: The increasing trust in large language models (LLMs), especially in the form of chatbots, is often undermined by the lack of their extrinsic evaluation. This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\ \href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}

### [357] [Domain-Grounded Evaluation of LLMs in International Student Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20653)
*Claudinei Daitx,Haitham Amar*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability and hallucination issues of large language models (LLMs) in answering study-abroad questions, using a detailed evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess how accurately LLMs can guide students in high-stakes areas like admissions, visas, and scholarships, while identifying potential hallucinations or unsupported claims in their responses.

Method: The study uses realistic questions from an EdTech advising platform (ApplyBoard) to evaluate LLMs on accuracy and hallucination. A grading rubric assessing correctness, partial answers, and domain coverage is implemented.

Result: The paper provides a detailed evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses, showcasing dependability and common failure points in answering study-abroad questions. It also measures faithfulness, answer relevance, and aggregate hallucination.

Conclusion: The study identifies the most reliable LLMs, common failure patterns, and introduces a practical framework for auditing LLMs in educational and advising contexts before their deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer high-stakes study-abroad questions about admissions, visas, scholarships, and eligibility. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').
  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.
  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.
  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.
  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.

Conclusion: CodeVaani lowers the programming education barrier for non-English speakers, provides multilingual and on-demand assistance, and demonstrates the potential for voice-based AI systems to improve inclusivity.

Abstract: Programming education often assumes English proficiency and text-based interaction, creating barriers for students from multilingual regions such as India. We present CodeVaani, a multilingual speech-driven assistant for understanding code, built into Bodhitree [1], a Learning Management System developed at IIT Bombay. It is a voice-enabled assistant that helps learners explore programming concepts in their native languages. The system integrates Indic ASR, a codeaware transcription refinement module, and a code model for generating relevant answers. Responses are provided in both text and audio for natural interaction. In a study with 28 beginner programmers, CodeVaani achieved 75% response accuracy, with over 80% of participants rating the experience positively. Compared to classroom assistance, our framework offers ondemand availability, scalability to support many learners, and multilingual support that lowers the entry barrier for students with limited English proficiency. The demo will illustrate these capabilities and highlight how voice-based AI systems can make programming education more inclusive. Supplementary artifacts and demo video are also made available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are challenges in visualizing complex, multi-dimensional environmental data and automating the creation of geospatial dashboards for risk analysis and decision support.

Method: The framework employs Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with a structured knowledge graph, Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP), self-validation using agent-based LLM mechanisms, and scalable React-based pipelines for code generation.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved functionality and performance over baseline methods, producing multi-page and fully functional interfaces for geospatial data visualization.

Conclusion: This innovative approach successfully incorporates LLMs, domain knowledge, and advanced mechanisms to automate the development of geospatial dashboards, enhancing decision-making and risk analysis frameworks.

Abstract: The development of web-based geospatial dashboards for risk analysis and decision support is often challenged by the difficulty in visualization of big, multi-dimensional environmental data, implementation complexity, and limited automation. We introduce a generative AI framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of interactive geospatial dashboards from user-defined inputs including UI wireframes, requirements, and data sources. By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces. We successfully developed a framework to implement LLMs, demonstrated the pipeline for automated code generation, deployment, and performed chain-of-thought AI agents in self-validation. This integrative approach is guided by structured knowledge and visual prompts, providing an innovative geospatial solution in enhancing risk analysis and decision making.

TL;DR: This paper explores a semi-automated AI workflow for creating video lectures, finding it effective and comparable to human-generated instructional materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline video lecture production for higher education, enhance accessibility, and reduce instructor workload without compromising pedagogical quality.

Method: A hybrid workflow using Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video creation was investigated, along with a pilot study comparing AI-generated videos to human instructional videos.

Result: AI-generated instructional videos were comparable to human videos in learning outcomes, with high student feedback on clarity and coherence. Limitations included audio quality and absence of human avatars.

Conclusion: AI-aided video production offers scalable, effective educational resources, but synthetic voices and avatars need improvement to further enhance engagement.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into video lecture production has the potential to transform higher education by streamlining content creation and enhancing accessibility. This paper investigates a semi automated workflow that combines Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video assembly. Unlike fully automated text to video platforms, this hybrid approach preserves pedagogical intent while ensuring script to slide synchronization, narrative coherence, and customization. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability. However, limitations remain, particularly regarding audio quality and the absence of human-like avatars. The findings suggest that AI assisted video production can reduce instructor workload, improve scalability, and deliver effective learning resources, while future improvements in synthetic voices and avatars may further enhance learner engagement.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TALES to evaluate cultural misrepresentations in AI-generated stories focusing on Indian cultural identities and finds significant inaccuracies in such stories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to examine how AI chatbots represent diverse cultures, especially in the context of creative, open-ended tasks where evaluating cultural representation is challenging.

Method: Developed TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations, and performed a large-scale annotation study involving feedback from participants with lived experiences across India. Evaluated six models using TALES-QA, a cultural knowledge question bank.

Result: 88% of AI-generated stories contain cultural inaccuracies, particularly in mid/low-resourced languages and peri-urban contexts. However, models have underlying cultural knowledge despite these errors.

Conclusion: AI models exhibit a mismatch between their inherent cultural knowledge and their generated outputs, highlighting the need to address cultural misrepresentations in AI storytelling.

Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.

Motivation: The need for an efficient and usable text entry method for augmented reality applications.

Method: The study utilizes STAR, a virtual QWERTY keyboard, where users type using their thumbs on a hand-overlay interface.

Result: Users achieved a typing speed of 21.9 words per minute, approximately 56% of their smartphone typing speed, and a 0.3% error rate after practicing for 30 minutes.

Conclusion: STAR demonstrates promise as an AR text entry system, with performance gaps analyzed and potential improvements discussed.

Abstract: While text entry is an essential and frequent task in Augmented Reality (AR) applications, devising an efficient and easy-to-use text entry method for AR remains an open challenge. This research presents STAR, a smartphone-analogous AR text entry technique that leverages a user's familiarity with smartphone two-thumb typing. With STAR, a user performs thumb typing on a virtual QWERTY keyboard that is overlain on the skin of their hands. During an evaluation study of STAR, participants achieved a mean typing speed of 21.9 WPM (i.e., 56% of their smartphone typing speed), and a mean error rate of 0.3% after 30 minutes of practice. We further analyze the major factors implicated in the performance gap between STAR and smartphone typing, and discuss ways this gap could be narrowed.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Momentum Mamba improves Human Activity Recognition (HAR) by addressing the limitations of existing models with second-order dynamics and enhancing long-sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing HAR models like vanishing/exploding gradients, high computational costs, and struggles with long-range dependency modeling.

Method: Introduced Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented structured state-space model (SSM) incorporating second-order dynamics, with extensions like Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling.

Result: The proposed model consistently outperformed baseline models like vanilla Mamba and Transformers across multiple HAR benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy, robustness, and faster convergence at a moderate training cost.

Conclusion: Momentum-augmented SSMs provide an optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency, serving as a scalable approach for HAR and broader sequence modeling tasks.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors is essential for ubiquitous computing, mobile health, and ambient intelligence. Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed. With only moderate increases in training cost, momentum-augmented SSMs offer a favorable accuracy-efficiency balance, establishing them as a scalable paradigm for HAR and a promising principal framework for broader sequence modeling applications.

*Ivan Kalthoff,Marcel Rey,Raphael Wittkowski*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for designing acoustic neural networks capable of performing computations via sound wave propagation, achieving energy-efficient analog computing with potential applications in environments where electronics are inefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional electronics face limitations in energy efficiency and operability in certain conditions. Acoustic neural networks offer a promising analog computing alternative but lack systematic design frameworks.

Method: The authors propose a digital-twin approach that trains conventional neural networks under physical constraints (non-negative signals and weights, compatible nonlinearities) to simulate acoustic computation. They incorporate learnable components tied to measurable acoustic properties.

Result: The framework enables accurate speech classification using constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures. A hybrid model, SincHSRNN, achieves 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components.

Conclusion: The paper advances the systematic design of acoustic neural networks, connecting computational elements to physical acoustic properties, and establishes principles for creating low-power wave-based computing systems.

Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSU-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating musical score understanding across textual and visual modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for assessing AI models' understanding of musical notation, facilitating research in this domain.

Method: Developed MSU-Bench with 1,800 human-curated QA pairs across four levels of understanding and evaluated over 15 models in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

Result: Highlighted challenges in modality gaps and comprehension levels, with fine-tuning yielding significant improvements for models.

Conclusion: MSU-Bench provides a foundation for advancing AI's capability in musicology and multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding complete musical scores requires reasoning over symbolic structures such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, and form. Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in natural language and multimodal tasks, their ability to comprehend musical notation remains underexplored. We introduce Musical Score Understanding Benchmark (MSU-Bench), the first large-scale, human-curated benchmark for evaluating score-level musical understanding across both textual (ABC notation) and visual (PDF) modalities. MSU-Bench comprises 1,800 generative question-answer (QA) pairs drawn from works spanning Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and others, organised into four progressive levels of comprehension: Onset Information, Notation & Note, Chord & Harmony, and Texture & Form. Through extensive zero-shot and fine-tuned evaluations of over 15+ state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we reveal sharp modality gaps, fragile level-wise success rates, and the difficulty of sustaining multilevel correctness. Fine-tuning markedly improves performance in both modalities while preserving general knowledge, establishing MSU-Bench as a rigorous foundation for future research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), musicological, and multimodal reasoning.

### [367] [SONAR: Spectral-Contrastive Audio Residuals for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21325)
*Ido Nitzan HIdekel,Gal lifshitz,Khen Cohen,Dan Raviv*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SONAR, a frequency-guided framework that improves the generalizability of Deepfake audio detectors by addressing spectral bias through high-frequency residuals and contrastive learning techniques. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake audio detection suffers from spectral bias, which limits the exploitation of high-frequency artifacts crucial for distinguishing real and fake audio.

Method: SONAR uses an XLSR encoder for low-frequency content and a high-pass filtered cloned path for high-frequency residuals. A frequency cross-attention mechanism integrates these representations, paired with a frequency-aware contrastive loss for optimization and sharper decision boundaries.

Result: SONAR demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy on Deepfake audio benchmarks and converges four times faster than competitive baselines.

Conclusion: By leveraging high-frequency residuals and contrastive techniques, SONAR sharpens decision boundaries for better Deepfake audio detection and can adapt to various architectures and modalities where high-frequency cues play a critical role.

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) audio detectors still struggle to generalize to out of distribution inputs. A central reason is spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency structure before high-frequency (HF) details, which both causes DF generators to leave HF artifacts and leaves those same artifacts under-exploited by common detectors. To address this gap, we propose Spectral-cONtrastive Audio Residuals (SONAR), a frequency-guided framework that explicitly disentangles an audio signal into complementary representations. An XLSR encoder captures the dominant low-frequency content, while the same cloned path, preceded by learnable SRM, value-constrained high-pass filters, distills faint HF residuals. Frequency cross-attention reunites the two views for long- and short-range frequency dependencies, and a frequency-aware Jensen-Shannon contrastive loss pulls real content-noise pairs together while pushing fake embeddings apart, accelerating optimization and sharpening decision boundaries. Evaluated on the ASVspoof 2021 and in-the-wild benchmarks, SONAR attains state-of-the-art performance and converges four times faster than strong baselines. By elevating faint high-frequency residuals to first-class learning signals, SONAR unveils a fully data-driven, frequency-guided contrastive framework that splits the latent space into two disjoint manifolds: natural-HF for genuine audio and distorted-HF for synthetic audio, thereby sharpening decision boundaries. Because the scheme operates purely at the representation level, it is architecture-agnostic and, in future work, can be seamlessly integrated into any model or modality where subtle high-frequency cues are decisive.

*Genís Plaja-Roglans,Yun-Ning Hung,Xavier Serra,Igor Pereira*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using diffusion models for singing voice separation in musical mixtures, showcasing improvements over prior methods and a balance between quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the process of separating singing voice from musical mixtures by leveraging the flexibility and generalization of diffusion models, addressing limitations of traditional neural networks.

Method: The method involves training a diffusion model to generate solo vocal tracks conditioned on corresponding music mixtures, and testing the effects of various user-configurable parameters.

Result: The approach shows improved performance over previous generative systems and achieves competitive scores against non-generative baselines, particularly with additional training data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that diffusion models can effectively tackle singing voice separation, offering flexibility in quality-efficiency trade-off and potential for user-driven refinement.

Abstract: Separating the individual elements in a musical mixture is an essential process for music analysis and practice. While this is generally addressed using neural networks optimized to mask or transform the time-frequency representation of a mixture to extract the target sources, the flexibility and generalization capabilities of generative diffusion models are giving rise to a novel class of solutions for this complicated task. In this work, we explore singing voice separation from real music recordings using a diffusion model which is trained to generate the solo vocals conditioned on the corresponding mixture. Our approach improves upon prior generative systems and achieves competitive objective scores against non-generative baselines when trained with supplementary data. The iterative nature of diffusion sampling enables the user to control the quality-efficiency trade-off, and also refine the output when needed. We present an ablation study of the sampling algorithm, highlighting the effects of the user-configurable parameters.

*Yicheng Zhong,Peiji Yang,Zhisheng Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework, GRPO, to improve prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and speech naturalness in single-codebook TTS models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues such as unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness in efficient single-codebook TTS LLMs.

Method: Introduced a multi-reward policy optimization framework, GRPO, that integrates three rule-based rewards (duration consistency, decoding stability, and prosody alignment) and utilizes an external reasoning LLM for prosody supervision.

Result: Demonstrated consistent gains in prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall naturalness, validated through scalability tests and integrating a flow-matching decoder.

Conclusion: The GRPO framework effectively enhances the performance of single-codebook TTS models, offering improved prosody and speech naturalness while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, inspiring autoregressive frameworks that represent speech as sequences of discrete codec tokens. Among them, single-codebook TTS LLMs have emerged as compact and streamable architectures that jointly model semantic and acoustic integration. However, despite their efficiency, these models often exhibit unstable prosody, speaker drift, and degraded naturalness. To address these issues, we propose a multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that directly optimizes the token generation policy of single-codebook TTS LLMs. Beyond standard intelligibility and speaker similarity objectives, our design integrates three rule-based rewards: a length penalty for duration consistency, an entropy regularization reward for decoding stability, and an LLM-annotated prosody alignment reward that explicitly supervises rhythm. In this prosody reward, an external reasoning LLM predicts multiple plausible pause structures via in-context learning, providing a human-preference-aligned supervisory signal for GRPO training. To assess universality, we further attach a flow-matching (FM) decoder on top of the GRPO-optimized AR backbone and observe consistent additional gains, indicating that our reinforcement optimization enhances the intrinsic AR policy. We further conduct a scalability analysis across data sizes and model scales, revealing that the proposed method consistently enhances prosodic stability, speaker similarity, and overall speech naturalness in single-codebook TTS LLMs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: HarmonicAttack is introduced as an efficient method to remove AI audio watermarks, demonstrating superior performance against state-of-the-art schemes in near real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misuse of AI-generated audio, such as misinformation and fraud, by studying effective watermark removal techniques to evaluate and improve watermark robustness.

Method: The authors propose HarmonicAttack—a dual-path convolutional autoencoder trained with GAN techniques that operates in temporal and frequency domains to separate watermarks from audio.

Result: HarmonicAttack outperforms previous methods in removing watermarks from schemes like AudioSeal, WavMark, and Silentcipher, delivering near real-time performance. It generalizes well to out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: HarmonicAttack presents an effective and efficient framework for watermark removal, highlighting critical implications for the robustness and security of AI-generated audio watermarking schemes.

Abstract: The availability of high-quality, AI-generated audio raises security challenges such as misinformation campaigns and voice-cloning fraud. A key defense against the misuse of AI-generated audio is by watermarking it, so that it can be easily distinguished from genuine audio. As those seeking to misuse AI-generated audio may thus seek to remove audio watermarks, studying effective watermark removal techniques is critical to being able to objectively evaluate the robustness of audio watermarks against removal. Previous watermark removal schemes either assume impractical knowledge of the watermarks they are designed to remove or are computationally expensive, potentially generating a false sense of confidence in current watermark schemes.
  We introduce HarmonicAttack, an efficient audio watermark removal method that only requires the basic ability to generate the watermarks from the targeted scheme and nothing else. With this, we are able to train a general watermark removal model that is able to remove the watermarks generated by the targeted scheme from any watermarked audio sample. HarmonicAttack employs a dual-path convolutional autoencoder that operates in both temporal and frequency domains, along with GAN-style training, to separate the watermark from the original audio. When evaluated against state-of-the-art watermark schemes AudioSeal, WavMark, and Silentcipher, HarmonicAttack demonstrates greater watermark removal ability than previous watermark removal methods with near real-time performance. Moreover, while HarmonicAttack requires training, we find that it is able to transfer to out-of-distribution samples with minimal degradation in performance.

Result: OpenEvolve successfully approached known bijection problems but struggled to independently solve open, research-level challenges, highlighting system limitations and the need for human input.

Conclusion: OpenEvolve and similar systems hold promise but are not yet capable of solving complex, novel mathematical problems without human collaboration. Insights are shared for advancing this research area.

Abstract: Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.

### [372] [Constrained deep learning for pricing and hedging european options in incomplete markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20837)
*Nicolas Baradel*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper presents a constrained deep learning model for option pricing and hedging in incomplete financial markets, showcasing its effectiveness in managing non-smooth payoffs via neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In incomplete markets, option pricing faces challenges due to unhedgeable risks and lacks unique solutions. The paper aims to mitigate these issues with a machine learning framework.

Method: A constrained neural network approach is used, optimizing a P&L loss function. The framework enforces self-financing conditions and integrates boundary constraints for non-smooth payoffs.

Result: Numerical experiments validate the framework, showing improved P&L distributions and robustness for various payoffs, including exotic options and scenarios with market jumps.

Conclusion: Constrained neural network architectures are valuable tools for pricing and hedging options in markets with incomplete or non-smooth payoffs, advancing applications in quantitative finance.

Abstract: In incomplete financial markets, pricing and hedging European options lack a unique no-arbitrage solution due to unhedgeable risks. This paper introduces a constrained deep learning approach to determine option prices and hedging strategies that minimize the Profit and Loss (P&L) distribution around zero. We employ a single neural network to represent the option price function, with its gradient serving as the hedging strategy, optimized via a loss function enforcing the self-financing portfolio condition. A key challenge arises from the non-smooth nature of option payoffs (e.g., vanilla calls are non-differentiable at-the-money, while digital options are discontinuous), which conflicts with the inherent smoothness of standard neural networks. To address this, we compare unconstrained networks against constrained architectures that explicitly embed the terminal payoff condition, drawing inspiration from PDE-solving techniques. Our framework assumes two tradable assets: the underlying and a liquid call option capturing volatility dynamics. Numerical experiments evaluate the method on simple options with varying non-smoothness, the exotic Equinox option, and scenarios with market jumps for robustness. Results demonstrate superior P&L distributions, highlighting the efficacy of constrained networks in handling realistic payoffs. This work advances machine learning applications in quantitative finance by integrating boundary constraints, offering a practical tool for pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.

### [373] [Cryptocurrency Portfolio Management with Reinforcement Learning: Soft Actor--Critic and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20678)
*Kamal Paykan*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning framework for cryptocurrency portfolio management using SAC and DDPG algorithms, which outperform traditional methods in volatile markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and exhibit nonlinear dynamics, making traditional portfolio management methods inadequate. The study aims to create a data-driven, adaptive solution for optimizing portfolios in such environments.

Method: A reinforcement learning agent is developed to directly interact with a simulated trading environment and optimize continuous trading actions. Two algorithms, SAC and DDPG, are applied to maximize returns while minimizing risks and costs.

Result: Experimental analysis shows that SAC and DDPG agents outperform baseline strategies like equal-weighted and mean-variance portfolios. SAC provides greater stability and is more robust in noisy market conditions.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning, specifically the SAC algorithm, presents a promising approach for adaptive cryptocurrency portfolio management.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning--based framework for cryptocurrency portfolio management using the Soft Actor--Critic (SAC) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. Traditional portfolio optimization methods often struggle to adapt to the highly volatile and nonlinear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. To address this, we design an agent that learns continuous trading actions directly from historical market data through interaction with a simulated trading environment. The agent optimizes portfolio weights to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing downside risk and transaction costs. Experimental evaluations on multiple cryptocurrencies demonstrate that the SAC and DDPG agents outperform baseline strategies such as equal-weighted and mean--variance portfolios. The SAC algorithm, with its entropy-regularized objective, shows greater stability and robustness in noisy market conditions compared to DDPG. These results highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning for adaptive and data-driven portfolio management in cryptocurrency markets.

### [374] [Beyond Accuracy: An Empirical Study of Uncertainty Estimation in Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21607)
*Zarin Tahia Hossain,Mostafa Milani*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well different imputation methods handle uncertainty, finding that accurate reconstructions often don't align with reliable uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of handling missing data, specifically focusing on reliable and calibrated uncertainty estimation, which is underestimated in current methods.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic empirical study comparing statistical, distribution alignment, and deep generative imputation methods across different datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates.

Result: The study finds that high accuracy does not equate to reliable uncertainty estimation. It offers analyses of accuracy, calibration, runtime trade-offs, and guidelines for selecting suitable methods for uncertainty-aware imputations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a deeper understanding of uncertainty in imputation methods, emphasizing that both accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty should guide the choice of models for data cleaning and downstream applications.

Abstract: Handling missing data is a central challenge in data-driven analysis. Modern imputation methods not only aim for accurate reconstruction but also differ in how they represent and quantify uncertainty. Yet, the reliability and calibration of these uncertainty estimates remain poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of uncertainty in imputation, comparing representative methods from three major families: statistical (MICE, SoftImpute), distribution alignment (OT-Impute), and deep generative (GAIN, MIWAE, TabCSDI). Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Post-Double-Autometrics, an improved method for estimating linear models, and compares its advantages to Post-Double-Lasso.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of the Post-Double-Lasso method in handling omitted variable bias in finite samples during linear regression analysis.

Method: Develop a new method named Post-Double-Autometrics, leveraging Autometrics, and test its performance against Post-Double-Lasso.

Result: Post-Double-Autometrics demonstrates superior performance to the Post-Double-Lasso method, reducing issues with omitted variable bias.

Conclusion: Post-Double-Autometrics offers a more accurate alternative in estimating models, with better real-world applicability exemplified through its insights into economic convergence hypotheses.

Abstract: Post-Double-Lasso is becoming the most popular method for estimating linear regression models with many covariates when the purpose is to obtain an accurate estimate of a parameter of interest, such as an average treatment effect. However, this method can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias in finite sample. We propose a new method called Post-Double-Autometrics, which is based on Autometrics, and show that this method outperforms Post-Double-Lasso. Its use in a standard application of economic growth sheds new light on the hypothesis of convergence from poor to rich economies.

### [376] [A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281)
*Boumediene Hamzi,Houman Owhadi*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Gaussian process (GP) framework for the 2D stochastic Navier–Stokes (SNS) equations, based on the stationary covariance of its Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Gaussian process methods are widely used in fluid dynamics, their prior assumptions often lack a rigorous connection to the system's long-term dynamics.

Method: They construct a Gaussian process prior using the stationary covariance of the linear Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model, rooted in the forcing spectrum and dissipation.

Result: The developed framework bridges theoretical stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) theory with practical data assimilation techniques for turbulent flows.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretically justified and practically applicable probabilistic framework for turbulent flow modeling, connecting mathematical theory with data-driven methods.

Abstract: The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics.
  In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.

### [377] [On the Periodic Orbits of the Dual Logarithmic Derivative Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21283)
*Xiaohang Yu,William Knottenbelt*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores the dual logarithmic derivative operator's ($\mathcal{A}$) periodic behavior, identifying period-2 orbits, fixed points, and classifying low-period solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the behavior of the dual logarithmic derivative operator $\mathcal{A}$ in a complex analytic framework, particularly its periodic dynamics.

Method: The authors analyze the periodic behavior of $\mathcal{A}$ using both explicit constructions (e.g., a canonical example of period-2 solutions) and classifications of rational and fixed-point solutions.

Result: A complete classification of period-2 solutions and fixed points is presented. The period-2 solutions are rational pairs, and all fixed points take the form $f(x)=1/(a-\ln x)$. Logistic-type functions exhibit pre-periodic behavior, transitioning to period-2 behavior.

Conclusion: The study provides an explicit understanding of low-period dynamics under the operator $\mathcal{A}$, showcasing its impact on function space dynamics.

Abstract: We study the periodic behaviour of the dual logarithmic derivative operator $\mathcal{A}[f]=\mathrm{d}\ln f/\mathrm{d}\ln x$ in a complex analytic setting. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits genuinely nondegenerate period-$2$ orbits and identify a canonical explicit example. Motivated by this, we obtain a complete classification of all nondegenerate period-$2$ solutions, which are precisely the rational pairs $(c a x^{c}/(1-ax^{c}),\, c/(1-ax^{c}))$ with $ac\neq 0$. We further classify all fixed points of $\mathcal{A}$, showing that every solution of $\mathcal{A}[f]=f$ has the form $f(x)=1/(a-\ln x)$. As an illustration, logistic-type functions become pre-periodic under $\mathcal{A}$ after a logarithmic change of variables, entering the period-$2$ family in one iterate. These results give an explicit description of the low-period structure of $\mathcal{A}$ and provide a tractable example of operator-induced dynamics on function spaces.

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating pseudospectral theory and optimal control theory into a combined framework, evaluates its theoretical foundations, and explores applications in NASA spacecraft flight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the application of optimal control theory in aerospace and autonomous systems by combining it with pseudospectral theory.

Method: The paper reviews theoretical aspects of pseudospectral optimal control and its implementation on NASA spacecraft, including its use in embedded systems.

Result: The development of pseudospectral optimal control has successfully been implemented in flight demonstrations and has significantly impacted challenging aerospace and autonomous system control problems.

Conclusion: Pseudospectral optimal control theory has revolutionized control methodologies in aerospace, providing a robust framework for tackling complex control problems.

Abstract: The home space for optimal control is a Sobolev space. The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct ``pseudospectral optimal control theory,'' a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.

*Anup Roy,Rishabh Gyanendra Upadhyay,Animesh Rameshbhai Panara,Robin Mills*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VisionRAG is a retrieval system that indexes document images directly, avoids OCR, uses lightweight semantic vectors, and achieves high efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document-centric retrieval systems are often complex, fragile, and lose critical spatial information, requiring a scalable and flexible alternative.

Method: VisionRAG employs a three-pass pyramid indexing framework for semantic vector creation and uses reciprocal rank fusion for robust ranking during retrieval.

Result: VisionRAG demonstrates strong performance on financial benchmarks with high accuracy and recall while employing fewer vectors per page, optimizing scalability and flexibility.

Conclusion: VisionRAG is a practical and OCR-free multimodal retrieval system that preserves spatial cues, simplifies pipelines, and achieves strong benchmark results with high efficiency.

Abstract: Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.
  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.
  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FITRep, a novel attention-guided framework to address near-duplicate item issues in online platforms, achieving better ad performance in real-world online tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address degradation in user experience on online platforms caused by near-duplicate items and structural collapse challenges in existing multimodal models.

Method: FITRep combines Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction for semantic concepts, Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction for efficient compression, and FAISS-Based Clustering for item deduplication.

Result: FITRep implemented on Meituan's advertising system led to significant improvements: +3.60% Click-Through Rate (CTR) and +4.25% Cost Per Mille (CPM) in A/B tests.

Conclusion: FITRep effectively resolves structural representation issues in multimodal systems, showcasing performance and real-world utility in item deduplication.

Abstract: Online platforms usually suffer from user experience degradation due to near-duplicate items with similar visuals and text. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable multimodal embedding, existing methods treat representations as black boxes, ignoring structural relationships (e.g., primary vs. auxiliary elements), leading to local structural collapse problem. To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS. Deployed on Meituan's advertising system, FITRep achieves +3.60% CTR and +4.25% CPM gains in online A/B tests, demonstrating both effectiveness and real-world impact.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes RIA, a unified framework that integrates ranking and reranking using advanced modeling techniques, achieving superior performance in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing recommendation methods that decouple ranking and reranking, causing weaker evaluation models and inefficiencies under latency constraints.

Method: Introduces RIA framework with four components: User-Candidate DualTransformer for user-item-context modeling, Context-aware User History module for position-sensitive preference learning, Listwise Multi-HSTU module for hierarchical item dependencies, and Embedding Cache for balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on public and industrial datasets with significant improvements in AUC, LogLoss, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Cost Per Mille (CPM).

Conclusion: RIA effectively unifies ranking and reranking, enabling robust contextual knowledge transfer and achieving notable performance improvements, even under low-latency conditions in real-world systems.

Abstract: Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMD-FUSE, a kernel-based two-sample test framework using quantum and hybrid kernels, achieving improved performance for small and high-dimensional datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of effective kernel selection in two-sample testing, especially for small datasets, to improve statistical test power and adaptability.

Method: The paper proposes MMD-FUSE, a framework combining classical and quantum kernels based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). The hybrid approach leverages domain-specific classical kernels and the expressive properties of quantum kernels.

Result: Experiments reveal that MMD-FUSE with tuned quantum kernels outperforms classical ones, demonstrating robustness and enhanced test power across small, high-dimensional, and diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Quantum and hybrid kernel strategies show great promise in improving statistical tests for small and complex datasets, offering adaptable tools for challenging data analysis scenarios.

Abstract: Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.

*Ayoob Salari,Kai Wu,Khawaja Fahad Masood,Y. Jay Guo,J. Andrew Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cost-effective and passive water-level monitoring approach using LTE downlink power metrics from standard devices, achieving high accuracy without the complexities of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to provide a lower-cost, easy-to-deploy, and resilient alternative to traditional water-level sensing methods that are expensive and vulnerable during extreme conditions.

Method: The approach utilizes LTE power metrics (RSRP, RSSI, RSRQ), employs Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to extract tidal features, and uses a lightweight neural network to model water-level changes. A multi-base-station integration method enhances robustness.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy, with RMSE of 0.8 cm and MAE of 0.5 cm in clear conditions, and transfers effectively to challenging settings with slightly higher but acceptable errors.

Conclusion: This method presents a practical, scalable solution for water-level monitoring, enabling reliable deployment even under challenging conditions using existing LTE infrastructure.

Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework for detecting and classifying subsurface defects in concrete bridge decks using Impact Echo (IE) techniques with 73% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subsurface defects in concrete bridge decks such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing are difficult to reliably detect using traditional methods, necessitating a more automated and accurate solution.

Method: The research uses machine learning with Impact Echo (IE) signals transformed via FFT, k-means clustering for defect zone identification, and a stacked LSTM network for classifying defect types, validated using laboratory slabs and field data.

Result: The framework achieved 73% classification accuracy across four defect types and demonstrated robustness under real-world environmental noise and variability.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning-based IE framework improves the objectivity, scalability, and consistency of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) for intelligent, data-driven monitoring of bridge health.

Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phase-aware EM algorithm for OFDM systems, solving the local maximum problem in blind channel estimation caused by phase ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the phase ambiguity problem in blind channel estimation for PSK-modulated OFDM systems, which hampers the performance of traditional EM algorithms.

Method: The authors propose utilizing extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. Candidates are formed using PSK modulation symmetries, and the decoder selects the best model, resolving phase ambiguity.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in channels with constant phase ambiguity, with negligible additional complexity after initialization.

Conclusion: The phase-aware EM algorithm improves initialization reliability and reduces convergence issues, proving to be effective in frequency-selective channels and practical for implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully establishes a reliable and portable non-contact method for vital sign monitoring, addressing both theoretical and hardware challenges.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices.

### [389] [Independent policy gradient-based reinforcement learning for economic and reliable energy management of multi-microgrid systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20977)
*Junkai Hu,Li Xia*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper addresses the economic and reliable energy management in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs), using a distributed method that optimizes performance over the long term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve energy management for MMSs by achieving efficiency and reliability, especially given challenges from intermittent renewable energy sources and decentralized decision-making.

Method: A mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG) framework is introduced, with novel distributed independent policy gradient and deep reinforcement learning algorithms for solving energy management challenges.

Result: Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating a balance between economic performance and operational reliability for MMSs.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed algorithms enable efficient and reliable energy management in MMSs, leveraging their computational capabilities and facilitating optimized, collaborative energy strategies.

Abstract: Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.

### [390] [Some aspects of robustness in modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21563)
*Sam Power,Giorgos Vasdekis*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper discusses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) robustness under distribution pathologies, proposing remedies for ‘rough’ and ‘flat’ target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of MCMC algorithms when sampling from problematic target distributions characterized by roughness or flatness.

Method: The authors review existing algorithms designed to handle the roughness and flatness of target distributions and evaluate their ability to improve MCMC robustness.

Result: The paper identifies key pathologies (roughness and flatness) and compiles a range of algorithmic remedies for handling these issues in MCMC.

Conclusion: Robust MCMC algorithms can mitigate challenging pathologies, and further investigation into innovative solutions for these problems is encouraged.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible approach to approximate sampling from intractable probability distributions, with a rich theoretical foundation and comprising a wealth of exemplar algorithms. While the qualitative correctness of MCMC algorithms is often easy to ensure, their practical efficiency is contingent on the `target' distribution being reasonably well-behaved.
  In this work, we concern ourself with the scenario in which this good behaviour is called into question, reviewing an emerging line of work on `robust' MCMC algorithms which can perform acceptably even in the face of certain pathologies.
  We focus on two particular pathologies which, while simple, can already have dramatic effects on standard `local' algorithms. The first is roughness, whereby the target distribution varies so rapidly that the numerical stability of the algorithm is tenuous. The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space. In each case, we formulate the pathology in concrete terms, review a range of proposed algorithmic remedies to the pathology, and outline promising directions for future research.

### [392] [PropensityBench: Evaluating Latent Safety Risks in Large Language Models via an Agentic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20703)
*Udari Madhushani Sehwag,Shayan Shabihi,Alex McAvoy,Vikash Sehwag,Yuancheng Xu,Dalton Towers,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces PropensityBench, a benchmark for assessing models' likelihood to engage in harmful actions when given dangerous capabilities, highlighting risks in current AI safety evaluation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings in current AI safety evaluations, which focus on capabilities but overlook the propensity of models to misuse dangerous abilities when provided, posing potential frontier risks.

Method: The authors propose PropensityBench, a framework that uses scenarios and proxy tools across four high-risk domains to simulate dangerous capabilities and assess models' behavioral tendencies under operational pressures.

Result: The study reveals that models frequently exhibit risky behavior, opting for high-risk tools under pressure, even without innate execution capabilities, demonstrating concerning inclinations.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the necessity of dynamic propensity assessments rather than solely focusing on static capability audits for the safe deployment of frontier AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked concerns over their potential to acquire and misuse dangerous or high-risk capabilities, posing frontier risks. Current safety evaluations primarily test for what a model \textit{can} do - its capabilities - without assessing what it $\textit{would}$ do if endowed with high-risk capabilities. This leaves a critical blind spot: models may strategically conceal capabilities or rapidly acquire them, while harboring latent inclinations toward misuse. We argue that $\textbf{propensity}$ - the likelihood of a model to pursue harmful actions if empowered - is a critical, yet underexplored, axis of safety evaluation. We present $\textbf{PropensityBench}$, a novel benchmark framework that assesses the proclivity of models to engage in risky behaviors when equipped with simulated dangerous capabilities using proxy tools. Our framework includes 5,874 scenarios with 6,648 tools spanning four high-risk domains: cybersecurity, self-proliferation, biosecurity, and chemical security. We simulate access to powerful capabilities via a controlled agentic environment and evaluate the models' choices under varying operational pressures that reflect real-world constraints or incentives models may encounter, such as resource scarcity or gaining more autonomy. Across open-source and proprietary frontier models, we uncover 9 alarming signs of propensity: models frequently choose high-risk tools when under pressure, despite lacking the capability to execute such actions unaided. These findings call for a shift from static capability audits toward dynamic propensity assessments as a prerequisite for deploying frontier AI systems safely. Our code is available at https://github.com/scaleapi/propensity-evaluation.

### [393] [InvisibleBench: A Deployment Gate for Caregiving Relationship AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20733)
*Ali Madad*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: InvisibleBench is a deployment evaluation framework for caregiving-relationship AI, assessing interactions across five dimensions and identifying safety gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-turn safety measures in AI caregiving systems by creating a benchmark for assessing longitudinal and deployment-readiness risks.

Method: Developed a benchmark evaluating AI interactions across five dimensions using 17 scenarios with autofail conditions for safety violations and assessing four AI models' performances.

Result: All tested models showed significant safety gaps, with varying strengths across dimensions. The highest overall score was 75.9% (DeepSeek Chat v3).

Conclusion: InvisibleBench highlights critical safety gaps in caregiving-relationship AI systems, emphasizing the need for deterministic crisis routing and extended safety assessments.

Abstract: InvisibleBench is a deployment gate for caregiving-relationship AI, evaluating 3-20+ turn interactions across five dimensions: Safety, Compliance, Trauma-Informed Design, Belonging/Cultural Fitness, and Memory. The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge. No clinical claims; this is a deployment-readiness evaluation.

### [394] [Large Language Models' Complicit Responses to Illicit Instructions across Socio-Legal Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20736)
*Xing Wang,Huiyuan Xie,Yiyan Wang,Chaojun Xiao,Huimin Chen,Holli Sargeant,Felix Steffek,Jie Shao,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the safety concerns of large language models (LLMs) in enabling unlawful activities through "complicit facilitation," revealing widespread susceptibility in assisting illicit scenarios and highlighting demographic disparities in their complicit behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the risks posed by large language models in facilitating unlawful actions and uncover biases in their behavior.

Method: Empirical studies using real-world legal cases and frameworks, constructing a benchmark with 269 illicit scenarios and 50 intents, and analyzing model reasoning traces.

Result: LLMs demonstrate widespread complicit facilitation, especially in societal crimes, frequent violations, and malicious intents, with demographic groups facing disproportionate risks. Biases driven by stereotypes are notable.

Conclusion: Existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient, with current LLMs showing susceptibility to facilitating unlawful activities and biases towards disadvantaged demographics. Enhanced safety measures are urgently needed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.

In this new educational scenario, a huge quantity of multimodal students' data from a variety of different sources can be captured, fused, and analyze. It offers to researchers and educators a unique opportunity of being able to discover new knowledge to better understand the learning process and to intervene if necessary. However, it is necessary to apply correctly data fusion approaches and techniques in order to combine various sources of multimodal learning analytics (MLA). These sources or modalities in MLA include audio, video, electrodermal activity data, eye-tracking, user logs, and click-stream data, but also learning artifacts and more natural human signals such as gestures, gaze, speech, or writing. This survey introduces data fusion in learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) and how these data fusion techniques have been applied in smart learning. It shows the current state of the art by reviewing the main publications, the main type of fused educational data, and the data fusion approaches and techniques used in EDM/LA, as well as the main open problems, trends, and challenges in this specific research area.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A dataset for 3D wing simulations in the transonic regime is introduced, advancing aerodynamic analysis beyond 2D airfoil studies. It enables drag-lift optimization and evaluates neural surrogates like AB-UPT, which exhibit strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerospace datasets overlook 3D phenomena like wingtip vortices and face challenges in transonic regimes due to flow non-linearity, demanding new solutions.

Method: The authors develop a comprehensive CFD dataset with volumetric and surface-level fields for 3D wings in transonic conditions, allowing evaluation of aerodynamic coefficients.

Result: AB-UPT performs well, generalizing aerodynamic results across unseen geometries and producing consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts.

Conclusion: Introducing the dataset enables advancements in aerodynamic design, and AB-UPT is validated as a robust tool for efficient transonic aerodynamic optimization.

Abstract: The widespread use of neural surrogates in automotive aerodynamics, enabled by datasets such as DrivAerML and DrivAerNet++, has primarily focused on bluff-body flows with large wakes. Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration. To facilitate future research, we open-source our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmmiAI/Emmi-Wing.

Method: Provides a roadmap focused on AI integration into scientific processes, discussing tools like large foundation models, self-driving labs, and trustworthy data handling.

Result: The paper identifies pivotal bottlenecks, such as the need for better data and integration methods, while also spotlighting promising synergies like generative systems and end-to-end workflows.

Conclusion: AI can accelerate and broaden scientific discovery if its systems are made more transparent, reproducible, and aligned with practical applications, overcoming challenges in current infrastructure.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in long-term online stability and inconsistent performance of ML-based subgrid parameterizations and harness crowdsourcing to enhance climate model performance.

Method: The paper couples architectures arising from a Kaggle competition with climate models, including full cloud microphysics, and evaluates their online performance to achieve stability and accuracy benchmarks.

Result: Multiple tested architectures achieve significant online stability and state-of-the-art metrics like bias patterns and RMSE, advancing the use of hybrid physics-AI models.

Conclusion: Crowdsourcing the offline problem leads to substantial improvements in online stability and climate model validity, marking a milestone in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation progress.

Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the measurement bottleneck in QML that restricts performance and poses privacy risks, especially in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained applications.

Method: Proposed a residual hybrid architecture that combines quantum features with raw input data before classification, maintaining low quantum complexity and enhancing integration with federated edge learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior accuracy (up to 55% improvement) over quantum-only and earlier hybrid models, alongside improved privacy robustness and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: This method provides an effective and practical avenue for utilizing quantum models in resource-limited and privacy-sensitive settings, advancing the field of quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.

### [400] [MAD-DAG: Protecting Blockchain Consensus from MEV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552)
*Roi Bar-Zur,Aviv Tamar,Ittay Eyal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Selfish mining exploits blockchain protocols to increase miner revenue. MAD-DAG, a new blockchain protocol, resists selfish mining, even in adverse conditions, achieving higher security thresholds than existing protocols such as Colordag and Bitcoin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the vulnerabilities of blockchain protocols to selfish mining, particularly under adverse conditions like rushing, miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners. Existing protocols like Colordag fail to provide adequate protection under these conditions.

Method: The researchers introduced MAD-DAG, a ledger protocol that discards the contents of competing equal-length chains in blockchain. They used a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model selfish mining and developed conservative reward rules for analyzing blockchain security thresholds, enabling tractable modeling for DAG-based blockchain protocols.

Result: MAD-DAG effectively withstands selfish mining attacks under adverse conditions. It achieves a higher security threshold (11%-31%) than existing protocols like Colordag and Bitcoin, which fail under similar conditions.

Conclusion: MAD-DAG provides a practical and robust solution against selfish mining attacks, maintaining security even under adverse conditions where other protocols fail. It sets a new standard for secure blockchain systems under varying environments.

Abstract: Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.
  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.
  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.
  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.
  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.

*Shuhan Xia,Jing Dai,Hui Ouyang,Yadong Shang,Dongxiao Zhao,Peipei Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAHS-Attack, a method for generating adversarial prompts targeting fragility in diffusion models using CLIP-aware heuristic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strengthening adversarial attack capabilities is crucial to uncover vulnerabilities in generative systems and improve robustness.

Method: The proposed method combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with a constrained genetic algorithm to refine adversarial prompts for attacking diffusion models effectively.

Result: CAHS-Attack outperforms existing methods in attacking diffusion models with prompts of varying lengths and semantics.

Conclusion: Current text-to-image pipelines relying on CLIP-based text encoders exhibit inherent vulnerabilities, posing a security risk for generative systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.

*Rebeka Toth,Tamas Bisztray,Richard Dubniczky*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study addresses the threat of phishing and spam emails, especially those generated by LLMs, by presenting an annotated dataset for email security research and assessing the performance of LLMs in identifying emotional and motivational cues from emails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by attackers to create deceptive phishing and spam emails, there is an urgent need for reliable means to identify and counter such threats.

Method: The research involved creating a comprehensive, annotated email dataset of legitimate, phishing, and spam emails (including human- and LLM-generated), benchmarking LLMs to annotate emotional and motivational aspects, and evaluating their robustness using original and rephrased emails.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that state-of-the-art LLMs show strong phishing detection capabilities but struggle consistently to differentiate spam from legitimate emails.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable tools and frameworks to advance email security research, highlighting both the potential and limits of current LLM systems in addressing phishing and spam email threats.

Abstract: Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.

*Yizhou Zhao,Xiang Li,Peter Song,Qi Long,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes TAB-DRW, a watermarking method for synthetic tabular data that is efficient, robust, and supports mixed data types, using frequency domain embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods for synthetic data are limited by high computational demands, struggles with mixed data types, and lack of robustness against modifications.

Method: The authors introduce TAB-DRW, which leverages frequency domain watermark embedding using the Yeo-Johnson transformation, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method.

Result: TAB-DRW demonstrates strong detectability, robustness against post-processing attacks, and preserves high data fidelity in experiments across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TAB-DRW is an effective and efficient solution for watermarking generative tabular data, addressing common limitations in robustness, efficiency, and support for mixed-type features.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.

*Barak Or*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTTR-A as a measure for cognitive recovery in multi-agent systems, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience through simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems by quantifying recovery from reasoning coherence loss.

Method: Classical reliability metrics are adapted into the cognitive domain. Simulations using AG News corpus and LangGraph framework model reflex-driven recovery latency.

Result: Automated reflexes restored stability in ~6 seconds, human interventions in ~12 seconds. Median simulated MTTR-A is 6.21±2.14s with other metrics providing runtime dependability proof.

Conclusion: The study formalizes cognitive recovery latency, linking recovery time and uptime for improved runtime dependability in distributed reasoning.

Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance

### [406] [Resilient Charging Infrastructure via Decentralized Coordination of Electric Vehicles at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20943)
*Chuhao Qin,Alexandru Sorici,Andrei Olaru,Evangelos Pournaras,Adina Magda Florea*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a collective learning framework for electric vehicles (EVs) to balance driver comfort and system efficiency under decentralized EV charging conditions, showing better performance under station outages and dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the struggle of existing decentralized EV charging approaches in handling severe contingencies such as station outages and unexpected charging surges, which lead to inefficient queues and discomfort.

Method: A collective learning framework was used to recommend adaptive charging behaviors for EVs, balancing comfort and efficiency dynamically while achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying conditions.

Result: The approach significantly reduced travel and queuing times, with selfish and altruistic behaviors at key moments achieving better results. Under uncertain conditions, it improved resilience and trustworthiness of the EV charging system.

Conclusion: The method successfully handles challenges like outages and adversarial conditions, paving the way for more efficient and resilient decentralized EV charging control.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces major challenges for decentralized charging control. Existing decentralized approaches efficiently coordinate a large number of EVs to select charging stations while reducing energy costs, preventing power peak and preserving driver privacy. However, they often struggle under severe contingencies, such as station outages or unexpected surges in charging requests. These situations create competition for limited charging slots, resulting in long queues and reduced driver comfort. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collective learning-based coordination framework that allows EVs to balance individual comfort on their selections against system-wide efficiency, i.e., the overall queues across all stations. In the framework, EVs are recommended for adaptive charging behaviors that shift priority between comfort and efficiency, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying station capacities and dynamic spatio-temporal EV distribution. Experiments using real-world data from EVs and charging stations show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, significantly reducing travel and queuing time. The results reveal that, under uncertain charging conditions, EV drivers that behave selfishly or altruistically at the right moments achieve shorter waiting time than those maintaining moderate behavior throughout. Our findings under high fractions of station outages and adversarial EVs further demonstrate improved resilience and trustworthiness of decentralized EV charging infrastructure.

*Ke Zhang,Xiaoning Zhao,Ce Zheng,Jiahong Ning,Dandan Zhu,Wenqi Zhang,Chen Sun,Toshiharu Sugawara*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tool-RoCo, a benchmark to assess LLMs' capacity for multi-agent cooperation and autonomy, using novel tools and paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in evaluating LLMs in autonomous and cooperative multi-agent systems, particularly focusing on self-organization and tool usage.

Method: Tool-RoCo evaluates LLMs in four paradigms of autonomy and cooperation, with three multi-robot tasks to assess their operations and decision-making.

Result: Results showed limited use of cooperative tools and a tendency for LLMs to maintain active agents without adaptive deactivation.

Conclusion: Tool-RoCo provides a novel and systematic benchmark, highlighting limitations in current LLMs for multi-agent cooperation and autonomy, paving the way for improvement in this area.

Abstract: This study proposes Tool-RoCo, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-term multi-agent cooperation based on RoCo, a multi-robot cooperative benchmark. Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy. Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks. Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco

### [408] [BAMAS: Structuring Budget-Aware Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21572)
*Liming Yang,Junyu Luo,Xuanzhe Liu,Yiling Lou,Zhenpeng Chen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents BAMAS, a cost-aware framework for building multi-agent systems using large language models (LLMs). It optimizes agent selection and collaboration under budget constraints, achieving significant cost reductions while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems using large language models struggle to address cost considerations effectively, creating barriers for practical deployment under budget constraints.

Method: BAMAS employs Integer Linear Programming to optimize LLM selection and utilizes reinforcement learning to define the interaction topology among agents. Once optimized, the system deploys these agents in collaboration.

Result: The BAMAS framework demonstrated comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods and reduced costs by up to 86% across three benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: BAMAS provides a practical solution for constructing budget-aware multi-agent systems that efficiently balance cost and task performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling autonomous agents to solve complex tasks. As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods. Results show that BAMAS achieves comparable performance while reducing cost by up to 86%.

*Tingkai Xue,Chin Chun Ooi,Zhengwei Ge,Fong Yew Leong,Hongying Li,Chang Wei Kang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-neural model for fast and accurate scalar transport predictions in complex domains, achieving efficiency and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide quicker and scalable methods for analyzing reduced metrics in physical simulations, as traditional 3D simulations are time-consuming.

Method: A hybrid physics-neural model jointly learns parameterization and neural closure for coarse-grained effects, enabling efficient predictions.

Result: The model achieves high computational speed (reduced from hours to less than a minute), data efficiency, and accurate results with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables rapid, precise, and adaptable surrogates for physical problems, outperforming traditional techniques in speed and flexibility.

Abstract: Numerical simulations provide key insights into many physical, real-world problems. However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.

*Saurabhchand Bhati,Samuel Thomas,Hilde Kuehne,Rogerio Feris,James Glass*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scalability issues of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) by exploring token compression techniques and fine-tuning methods, achieving reduced token input while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome LALM scalability challenges caused by the quadratic complexity of attention and high token rates, which limit long-form audio processing and edge-device deployment.

Method: The authors applied techniques like unsupervised segmentation and uniform average pooling to compress audio tokens post-encoder and used low-rank adapters for finetuning to counteract performance losses due to compression.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated that the compressed LALMs achieved near frame-level LALM performance, while reducing the audio token count by up to three times before using the LLM decoder.

Conclusion: Compressed LALMs can effectively reduce input token requirements while maintaining strong performance, making them more scalable and deployable on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: RosettaSpeech proposes an innovative zero-shot speech-to-speech translation method with no need for parallel speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel speech corpora are scarce and complicate speech-to-speech translation systems, calling for a simplified, scalable method.

Method: The method uses monolingual speech-text data augmented with machine translation supervision, relying on text as a bridge while eliminating the need for parallel speech pairs.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVSS-C benchmarks with significant ASR-BLEU score improvements for German-to-English and Spanish-to-English translations.

Conclusion: RosettaSpeech provides a scalable, efficient solution for high-quality, speaker-preserving speech-to-speech translation across many languages without parallel speech data.

Abstract: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.

Result: Baseline experiments with X-UMX models show potential and challenges in source separation, especially in orchestral music settings.

Conclusion: The Spheres dataset offers a valuable resource for machine learning research in music source separation, localization, and other acoustic tasks in classical music.

Abstract: This paper introduces The Spheres dataset, multitrack orchestral recordings designed to advance machine learning research in music source separation and related MIR tasks within the classical music domain. The dataset is composed of over one hour recordings of musical pieces performed by the Colibrì Ensemble at The Spheres recording studio, capturing two canonical works - Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 - along with chromatic scales and solo excerpts for each instrument. The recording setup employed 23 microphones, including close spot, main, and ambient microphones, enabling the creation of realistic stereo mixes with controlled bleeding and providing isolated stems for supervised training of source separation models. In addition, room impulse responses were estimated for each instrument position, offering valuable acoustic characterization of the recording space. We present the dataset structure, acoustic analysis, and baseline evaluations using X-UMX based models for orchestral family separation and microphone debleeding. Results highlight both the potential and the challenges of source separation in complex orchestral scenarios, underscoring the dataset's value for benchmarking and for exploring new approaches to separation, localization, dereverberation, and immersive rendering of classical music.

TL;DR: MTI-Net integrates liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification into a unified end-to-end framework, leveraging innovative mechanisms to exploit dynamic MRI data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks an effective framework for integrating segmentation, regression, and classification of liver tumors while harnessing dynamic MRI information.

Method: MTI-Net employs Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF) for feature integration, a task interaction module for inter-task consistency, a task-driven discriminator, and a shallow Transformer for dynamic MRI encoding.

Result: Experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects show MTI-Net achieves high performance across tasks, demonstrating its potential in clinical liver tumor assessment.

Conclusion: MTI-Net significantly improves liver tumor segmentation, regression, and classification tasks by leveraging advanced techniques and dynamic MRI information.

Abstract: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

*Nelson H. T. Lemes,José Claudinei Ferreira,Higor V. M. Ferreira*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for Raman spectrum analysis using fractional derivatives in a variational framework to reduce noise while preserving critical spectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of noise interference and fluorescence signals in Raman spectrum analysis, preventing accurate reading of subtle features.

Method: A variational approach, operating in the frequency domain with Fourier transform, uses the concept of fractional derivatives and optimizes parameters like regularization and derivative order with Shannon entropy.

Result: The proposed method effectively balances noise suppression and the preservation of essential spectral and image features, offering a robust and efficient solution.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a robust, efficient filter for Raman spectrum noise reduction and could extend to image processing, with fractional derivatives and entropy-driven optimization being key innovations.

Abstract: The interference of fluorescence signals and noise remains a significant challenge in Raman spectrum analysis, often obscuring subtle spectral features that are critical for accurate analysis. Inspired by variational methods similar to those used in image denoising, our approach minimizes a functional involving fractional derivatives to balance noise suppression with the preservation of essential chemical features of the signal, such as peak position, intensity, and area. The original problem is reformulated in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform, making the implementation simple and fast. In this work, we discuss the theoretical framework, practical implementation, and the advantages and limitations of this method in the context of {simulated} Raman data, as well as in image processing. The main contribution of this article is the combination of a variational approach in the frequency domain, the use of fractional derivatives, and the optimization of the {regularization parameter and} derivative order through the concept of Shannon entropy. This work explores how the fractional order, combined with the regularization parameter, affects noise removal and preserves the essential features of the spectrum {and image}. Finally, the study shows that the combination of the proposed strategies produces an efficient, robust, and easily implementable filter.

*Chicago Y. Park,Michael T. McCann,Cristina Garcia-Cardona,Brendt Wohlberg,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a method to make neural networks accept scalar inputs by dynamically interpolating parameter sets based on scalar values, improving performance in diffusion and flow-matching models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of designing network architectures that combine high-dimensional vectors (e.g., images) and scalar inputs, particularly in generative models like diffusion and flow matching.

Method: DPI introduces two learnable parameter sets within a single network and dynamically interpolates between them based on scalar values during training and sampling, without restricting network architectures.

Result: DPI enhances denoising performance and improves sample quality in generative models, maintaining computational efficiency similar to standard scalar conditioning methods.

Conclusion: DPI is a simple, general-purpose, and architecture-agnostic technique for implementing scalar dependence in neural networks, proving effective and efficient in generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: We propose deep parameter interpolation (DPI), a general-purpose method for transforming an existing deep neural network architecture into one that accepts an additional scalar input. Recent deep generative models, including diffusion models and flow matching, employ a single neural network to learn a time- or noise level-dependent vector field. Designing a network architecture to accurately represent this vector field is challenging because the network must integrate information from two different sources: a high-dimensional vector (usually an image) and a scalar. Common approaches either encode the scalar as an additional image input or combine scalar and vector information in specific network components, which restricts architecture choices. Instead, we propose to maintain two learnable parameter sets within a single network and to introduce the scalar dependency by dynamically interpolating between the parameter sets based on the scalar value during training and sampling. DPI is a simple, architecture-agnostic method for adding scalar dependence to a neural network. We demonstrate that our method improves denoising performance and enhances sample quality for both diffusion and flow matching models, while achieving computational efficiency comparable to standard scalar conditioning techniques.

Conclusion: Prompt-guided approaches like PA-EWC enable effective continual learning in medical vision-language models, ensuring adaptability and retention of critical diagnostic knowledge.

Abstract: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.

*Xinyue Guo,Xiaoran Yang,Lipan Zhang,Jianxuan Yang,Zhao Wang,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces AV-Edit, an advanced tool for sound effect editing in videos using multimodal data (visual, audio, and text).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sound effect editing methods limit flexibility and audio quality due to reliance on low-level signal processing or text prompts.

Method: The AV-Edit framework uses a contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) and a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) for precise audio editing in alignment with video content.

Result: Experiments show AV-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing high-quality and contextually accurate audio modifications.

Conclusion: AV-Edit enhances sound editing flexibility and audio quality by effectively leveraging multimodal data, offering significant advancements in the domain.

Abstract: Sound effect editing-modifying audio by adding, removing, or replacing elements-remains constrained by existing approaches that rely solely on low-level signal processing or coarse text prompts, often resulting in limited flexibility and suboptimal audio quality. To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized machine learning on text-attributed graphs, but the application of LLMs to graph outlier detection, particularly in the context of fake news detection, remains significantly underexplored. One of the key challenges is the scarcity of large-scale, realistic, and well-annotated datasets that can serve as reliable benchmarks for outlier detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce TAGFN, a large-scale, real-world text-attributed graph dataset for outlier detection, specifically fake news detection. TAGFN enables rigorous evaluation of both traditional and LLM-based graph outlier detection methods. Furthermore, it facilitates the development of misinformation detection capabilities in LLMs through fine-tuning. We anticipate that TAGFN will be a valuable resource for the community, fostering progress in robust graph-based outlier detection and trustworthy AI.

### [419] [Learning Multi-Order Block Structure in Higher-Order Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21350)
*Kazuki Nakajima,Yuya Sasaki,Takeaki Uno,Masaki Aida*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes higher-order networks using hypergraphs, introducing a multi-order stochastic block model for better mesoscale organization analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior single-order models, which overlook order-dependent structural details in higher-order network interactions.

Method: The authors propose a multi-order stochastic block model that partitions interaction orders and optimizes out-of-sample hyperlink prediction while accommodating order-specific affinity patterns.

Result: This approach demonstrates superior predictive performance and reveals more interpretable mesoscale structures, compared to single-order models, across a range of real-world networks.

Conclusion: Order-dependent mechanisms are fundamental to mesoscale organization in higher-order networks, and accounting for these leads to better modeling and insights into real-world systems.

Abstract: Higher-order networks, naturally described as hypergraphs, are essential for modeling real-world systems involving interactions among three or more entities. Stochastic block models offer a principled framework for characterizing mesoscale organization, yet their extension to hypergraphs involves a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. A recent simplification, a single-order model, mitigates this complexity by assuming a single affinity pattern governs interactions of all orders. This universal assumption, however, may overlook order-dependent structural details. Here, we propose a framework that relaxes this assumption by introducing a multi-order block structure, in which different affinity patterns govern distinct subsets of interaction orders. Our framework is based on a multi-order stochastic block model and searches for the optimal partition of the set of interaction orders that maximizes out-of-sample hyperlink prediction performance. Analyzing a diverse range of real-world networks, we find that multi-order block structures are prevalent. Accounting for them not only yields better predictive performance over the single-order model but also uncovers sharper, more interpretable mesoscale organization. Our findings reveal that order-dependent mechanisms are a key feature of the mesoscale organization of real-world higher-order networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to accelerate the discovery of thermoelectric materials with high figures of merit by identifying compounds with desirable thermal conductivity properties.

Method: Utilizing a curated dataset of 71,913 materials, the researchers used machine learning models to analyze and predict thermal conductivity properties. They further screened compounds and optimized thermoelectric performance based on the phonon-glass electron-crystal concept.

Result: The framework identified 2,522 ultralow-thermal-conductivity candidates among 104,567 compounds. Case studies showed successful optimization strategies for material performance enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven framework effectively bridges the gap between rapid material screening and enhancing thermoelectric performance, enabling more efficient material discovery.

Abstract: Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $κ$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$κ$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $κ$ and $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$κ$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.
