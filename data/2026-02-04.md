### [1] [CreditAudit: 2D Auditing for LLM Evaluation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02515)
*Yiliang Song,Hongjun An,Jiangong Xiao,Haofei Zhao,Jiawei Shao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leaderboard scores on benchmarks often fail to align with real-world performance due to dynamic prompts and protocols changes. Authors propose CreditAudit framework to evaluate language models' mean ability and stability under diverse prompts and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing public benchmark scores fail to reflect real-world model performance due to changing prompts and procedures, leaving practitioners unsure about choosing effective models for deployment.

Method: CreditAudit is introduced as a framework that uses semantically consistent system prompt templates and quantifies both mean performance and fluctuation risk by grading models via a AAA to BBB credit grading system with diagnostic strategies to reduce template-specific difficulties.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro reveal models with similar average performances exhibiting varied stability risks, which impact prioritization decisions in critical deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: CreditAudit provides a multi-dimensional and interpretable framework for real-world model selection by offering stability evaluations and a grading system, guiding better decisions in testing, monitoring, and deployment efforts.

Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.

### [2] [Experience-Driven Multi-Agent Systems Are Training-free Context-aware Earth Observers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02559)
*Pengyu Dai,Weihao Xuan,Junjue Wang,Hongruixuan Chen,Jian Song,Yafei Ou,Naoto Yokoya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolver is introduced to address challenges in Earth Observation (EO) tasks using a self-evolving multi-agent system that enables large language model (LLM) agents to gain expertise through structured interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of LLM agents in specialized, tool-intensive domains like EO, where multi-modal, multi-temporal data and strict geo-knowledge constraints pose unique challenges.

Method: The method involves a multi-agent system (GeoEvolver) that decomposes queries into sub-goals, explores diverse configurations, and uses an evolving memory bank for in-context learning without updating parameters.

Result: Experiments across EO benchmarks showed that GeoEvolver improved task success rates by an average of 12% across different LLM backbones.

Conclusion: GeoEvolver enables progressive emergence of EO expertise in LLM agents, solving complex tasks through structured interaction and fine-grained learning.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled large language model (LLM) agents to solve complex tasks by orchestrating external tools. However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries. Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show that GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success, with an average gain of 12\% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions with the environment.

### [3] [Uncertainty and Fairness Awareness in LLM-Based Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02582)
*Chandan Kumar Sah,Xiaoli Lian,Li Zhang,Tony Xu,Syed Shazaib Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies fairness and uncertainty in LLM-driven recommendations and creates metrics to evaluate biases and reliability, proposing methods for improving equity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address reliability and fairness concerns in recommendations made by large language models, highlighting predictive uncertainty and systematic biases.

Method: The authors introduce a curated benchmark with metrics and annotated dataset across demographic attributes and domains, and propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology.

Result: They quantify biases and fairness gaps, reveal trade-offs between personalization and group fairness, and demonstrate disparities in large LLM recommendations.

Conclusion: The paper establishes foundational tools for improving fairness, explainability, and reliability in LLM-based recommendations, encouraging future advancements in benchmarking and adaptive calibration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable powerful zero-shot recommendations by leveraging broad contextual knowledge, yet predictive uncertainty and embedded biases threaten reliability and fairness. This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.

### [4] [PeerRank: Autonomous LLM Evaluation Through Web-Grounded, Bias-Controlled Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02589)
*Yanki Margalit,Erni Avram,Ran Taig,Oded Margalit,Nurit Cohen-Inger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PeerRank, a fully autonomous evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) using web-grounded answering to scale evaluations beyond traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for large language models depend heavily on human-authored benchmarks, which are costly, quickly outdated, and mismatched for open-world applications.

Method: PeerRank employs a multi-agent approach where models autonomously generate tasks, respond with web-grounded information, assess peer responses, and aggregate evaluations without human intervention.

Result: PeerRank successfully ranks 12 commercial LLMs using over 420 autonomously generated questions, producing consistent and bias-aware performance estimates. It validates results on standard metrics like TruthfulQA and GSM8K.

Conclusion: PeerRank demonstrates scalable, autonomous evaluation of LLMs, overcoming limitations of static benchmarks and incorporating bias-aware, web-grounded assessment for accurate model comparisons.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models typically relies on human-authored benchmarks, reference answers, and human or single-model judgments, approaches that scale poorly, become quickly outdated, and mismatch open-world deployments that depend on web retrieval and synthesis. We introduce PeerRank, a fully autonomous end-to-end evaluation framework in which models generate evaluation tasks, answer them with category-scoped live web grounding, judge peer responses and aggregate dense peer assessments into relative performance estimates, without human supervision or gold references. PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator, while removing biased judgments. In a large-scale study over 12 commercially available models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produces stable, discriminative rankings and reveals measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings are robust, and mean peer scores agree with Elo. We further validate PeerRank on TruthfulQA and GSM8K, where peer scores correlate with objective accuracy. Together, these results suggest that bias-aware peer evaluation with selective web-grounded answering can scale open-world LLM assessment beyond static and human curated benchmarks.

### [5] [A Positive Case for Faithfulness: LLM Self-Explanations Help Predict Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02639)
*Harry Mayne,Justin Singh Kang,Dewi Gould,Kannan Ramchandran,Adam Mahdi,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG) to measure how faithfully LLM self-explanations predict the model's behavior. It evaluates 18 models on 7,000 counterfactuals and highlights that self-explanations enhance behavioral predictions but can occasionally be misleading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The faithfulness of LLM self-explanations remains poorly understood and existing metrics fail to directly assess their predictive value. This study aims to provide a reliable metric to determine if self-explanations reflect true decision-making processes.

Method: The authors propose NSG, a scalable metric based on how well explanations help predict a model's behavior. They test this across 18 models using thousands of counterfactuals from various domains like health, business, and ethics.

Result: Results show self-explanations improve prediction accuracy of model behavior (11-37% NSG) and outperform external explanatory models. However, 5-15% of self-explanations are significantly misleading, revealing areas for improvement.

Conclusion: Despite imperfections, self-explanations encode useful information that enhances understanding of model behavior, offering advantages external methods cannot match. NSG establishes a robust way to evaluate explanation faithfulness.

Abstract: LLM self-explanations are often presented as a promising tool for AI oversight, yet their faithfulness to the model's true reasoning process is poorly understood. Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.

### [6] [MARS: Modular Agent with Reflective Search for Automated AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02660)
*Jiefeng Chen,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra,Jaehyun Nam,Rui Meng,Tomas Pfister,Jinsung Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARS, a framework for autonomous AI research optimizing performance and execution cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARS is designed to address challenges in AI research automation, where conventional LLM agents fail due to computationally heavy evaluations and opaque causal factors.

Method: The framework uses Budget-Aware Planning via MCTS for cost-effective decision-making, Modular Construction for systematized research, and Comparative Reflective Memory for insight extraction.

Result: MARS achieves state-of-the-art results in open-source investigations and shows effective cross-branch generalization of insights.

Conclusion: MARS framework enhances autonomous AI research by balancing costs, improving modularity in research processes, and deriving actionable insights through reflective analysis.

Abstract: Automating AI research differs from general software engineering due to computationally expensive evaluation (e.g., model training) and opaque performance attribution. Current LLM-based agents struggle here, often generating monolithic scripts that ignore execution costs and causal factors. We introduce MARS (Modular Agent with Reflective Search), a framework optimized for autonomous AI research. MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a "Design-Decompose-Implement" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative "Aha!" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.

### [7] [ATLAS : Adaptive Self-Evolutionary Research Agent with Task-Distributed Multi-LLM Supporters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02709)
*Ujin Jeon,Jiyong Kwon,Madison Ann Sullivan,Caleb Eunho Lee,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATLAS, a framework for adaptive multi-agent learning that includes a core algorithm, EvoDPO, and demonstrates its superior performance over static single-agent systems in dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing multi-LLM systems struggle with adaptability in long-horizon tasks due to frozen solvers or static optimization loops, necessitating a more dynamic and task-distributed framework.

Method: The framework, ATLAS, uses a lightweight research agent supported by specialized agents for exploration and optimization. It incorporates EvoDPO, which adapts a phase-indexed reference policy, and theoretical regret analysis for preference-based contextual bandits under concept drift.

Result: ATLAS demonstrated improved stability and performance in experiments involving non-stationary contextual bandits and SciML loss reweighting tasks, compared to static, single-agent systems.

Conclusion: ATLAS is a promising framework that enhances adaptability and performance in long-horizon and dynamic tasks, outperforming traditional static systems.

Abstract: Recent multi-LLM agent systems perform well in prompt optimization and automated problem-solving, but many either keep the solver frozen after fine-tuning or rely on a static preference-optimization loop, which becomes intractable for long-horizon tasks. We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation. Both results show that ATLAS improves stability and performance over a static single-agent baseline.

### [8] [Dynamic Mix Precision Routing for Efficient Multi-step LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02711)
*Yuanzhe Li,Jianing Deng,Jingtong Hu,Tianlong Chen,Song Wang,Huanrui Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates improving the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) in long-horizon decision-making tasks by introducing a dynamic mix-precision routing framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the inference efficiency and cost-effectiveness of large language models during multi-step long-horizon decision-making tasks.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that selectively switches between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained using KL-divergence-based supervised learning and Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that the approach improves the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost compared to single-precision baselines and heuristic methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances accuracy and computational efficiency in multi-step decision-making tasks, offering a viable solution for optimizing LLM performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) achieve strong performance in long-horizon decision-making tasks through multi-step interaction and reasoning at test time. While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates. Experiments on ALFWorld demonstrate that our approach achieves a great improvement on accuracy-cost trade-off over single-precision baselines and heuristic routing methods.

### [9] [Scaling-Aware Adapter for Structure-Grounded LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02780)
*Zihao Jing,Qiuhao Zeng,Ruiyi Fang,Yan Yi Li,Yan Sun,Boyu Wang,Pingzhao Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Cuttlefish,' an all-atom language model for biomolecular structure reasoning, addressing limitations of existing methods by integrating geometric grounding and scaling modality tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs for biomolecular reasoning are limited by modality-specific approaches and a lack of geometric grounding, which leads to suboptimal structural reasoning and hallucinations.

Method: Cuttlefish employs Scaling-Aware Patching for adaptive token generation scaling with structural complexity and a Geometry Grounding Adapter to refine tokens with cross-attention, improving geometric reasoning.

Result: Cuttlefish demonstrated superior performance in diverse all-atom reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: The integration of geometric cues and adaptive token scaling allows Cuttlefish to unify reasoning across biomolecular structures effectively. The codebase is open-source for further development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling reasoning over biomolecular structures, yet existing methods remain modality-specific and typically compress structural inputs through sequence-based tokenization or fixed-length query connectors. Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning. Code is available at the project repository.

### [10] [Chain of Simulation: A Dual-Mode Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models with Dynamic Problem Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02842)
*Saeid Sheikhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain of Simulation (CoS), a new reasoning framework for dynamically routing problems to specific strategies in large language models, achieving performance improvements across benchmarks without additional model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompting approaches in LLMs fail to dynamically adapt reasoning strategies for different problem types, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: CoS employs three reasoning modes: computational flow with self-consistency for math, symbolic state tracking with JSON for spatial reasoning, and hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. It uses algorithms for mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction.

Result: CoS showed improved performance across benchmarks, achieving 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K, 90% on StrategyQA, and 19% on bAbI, outperforming baselines with significant improvements.

Conclusion: CoS enhances LLM reasoning by dynamically adapting problem-specific strategies without additional training, offering better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present Chain of Simulation (CoS), a novel dual-mode reasoning framework that dynamically routes problems to specialized reasoning strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike existing uniform prompting approaches, CoS employs three distinct reasoning modes: (1) computational flow with self-consistency for mathematical problems, (2) symbolic state tracking with JSON representations for spatial reasoning, and (3) hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. Through comprehensive evaluation on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and bAbI benchmarks using four state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3 27B, LLaMA-3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen-2.5 14B), we demonstrate that CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to the strongest baselines. The analysis reveals that problem-specific mode selection is crucial, with computational mode achieving 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems, while misrouting leads to 0% accuracy. We provide detailed algorithms for mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction, establishing CoS as an effective approach for improving LLM reasoning without additional training. The framework provides superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency compared to Self-Consistency, achieving comparable performance at 54% lower computational cost.

### [11] [AutoSizer: Automatic Sizing of Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits via Large Language Model (LLM) Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02849)
*Xi Yu,Dmitrii Torbunov,Soumyajit Mandal,Yihui Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoSizer, a meta-optimization framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), improves analog and mixed-signal circuit sizing by adaptive search-space refinement, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in AMS circuit sizing, which is resource-intensive and highly dependent on expert knowledge.

Method: AutoSizer uses a two-loop optimization process: the inner loop performs circuit sizing, while the outer loop refines the search space based on simulation feedback.

Result: AutoSizer achieved better solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rates compared to traditional methods and LLM-based agents in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: AutoSizer demonstrates effective circuit sizing with superior optimization performance, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven frameworks in AMS design.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits remains heavily reliant on expert knowledge, with transistor sizing a major bottleneck due to nonlinear behavior, high-dimensional design spaces, and strict performance constraints. Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.

### [12] [STEER: Inference-Time Risk Control via Constrained Quality-Diversity Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02862)
*Eric Yang,Jong Ha Lee,Jonathan Amar,Elissa Ye,Yugang Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces STEER, a framework to provide tunable control in decision-making tasks for LLMs without compromising safety and competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models often suffer from mode collapse, limiting their ability to produce diverse responses. This is problematic for tasks like clinical triage, where adjusting decision thresholds for sensitivity and specificity is crucial.

Method: STEER uses an offline constrained quality-diversity search to generate a population of personas ensuring diverse behavioral options while meeting safety and reasoning standards. At inference time, it allows users to adjust risk thresholds via a control parameter.

Result: STEER demonstrated broader behavioral coverage compared to other methods. It also maintained higher accuracy in critical cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous situations in clinical triage benchmarks.

Conclusion: STEER offers a new paradigm for safer and tunable decision-making in LLMs, enabling adjustable behavior without sacrificing accuracy or domain proficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for average correctness often exhibit mode collapse, producing narrow decision behaviors on tasks where multiple responses may be reasonable. This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.

### [13] ["I May Not Have Articulated Myself Clearly": Diagnosing Dynamic Instability in LLM Reasoning at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02863)
*Jinkun Chen,Fengxiang Cheng,Sijia Han,Vlado Keselj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates detecting reasoning failures in large language models during generation by analyzing token log probabilities and developing an instability signal. The method predicts incorrect answers and distinguishes between corrective and destructive instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reasoning failures in large language models occurring during the generation process, rather than only evaluating final outputs.

Method: The authors define an instability signal based on consecutive-step distributional shifts (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), using token log probabilities from standard APIs. They summarize traces by peak instability strength and analyze recoverability of reasoning depending on the timing of instability.

Result: The instability signal successfully predicts incorrect answers with above-chance AUC and demonstrates a scalable bucket-level accuracy decline across model sizes. It distinguishes between corrective and destructive instability.

Conclusion: Instability during reasoning can serve as a diagnostic tool to understand failure dynamics in language models. Early instability can lead to corrections, whereas late instability often results in failure. The method is model-agnostic and reproducible.

Abstract: Reasoning failures in large language models (LLMs) are typically measured only at the end of a generation, yet many failures manifest as a process-level breakdown: the model "loses the thread" mid-reasoning. We study whether such breakdowns are detectable from inference-time observables available in standard APIs (token log probabilities), without any training or fine-tuning. We define a simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and a correct final answer (\emph{corrective instability}), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (\emph{destructive instability}), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon. The method is model-agnostic, training-free, and reproducible, and is presented as a diagnostic lens rather than a corrective or control mechanism.

*Marco Gutierrez,Xinyi Leng,Hannah Cyberey,Jonathan Richard Schwarz,Ahmed Alaa,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BenchAlign, a system designed to align existing benchmarks with real-world preferences, enabling more accurate ranking of unseen language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks often fail to predict real-world utility, motivating the need for improved benchmark alignment to better reflect practical preferences.

Method: BenchAlign uses a system to learn weighted rankings for benchmark questions by leveraging limited machine performance data and ranked model preferences from deployment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the aligned benchmarks accurately rank unseen models according to human-like preferences while retaining interpretability.

Conclusion: BenchAlign improves the alignment of benchmarks with real-world human preferences, offering a pathway to optimize language models for practical utility.

Abstract: Language model benchmarks are pervasive and computationally-efficient proxies for real-world performance. However, many recent works find that benchmarks often fail to predict real utility. Towards bridging this gap, we introduce benchmark alignment, where we use limited amounts of information about model performance to automatically update offline benchmarks, aiming to produce new static benchmarks that predict model pairwise preferences in given test settings. We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable. Overall, our work provides insights into the limits of aligning benchmarks with practical human preferences, which stands to accelerate model development towards real utility.

### [15] [Minimal Computational Preconditions for Subjective Perspective in Artificial Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02902)
*Hongju Pae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for operationalizing subjective perspectives in artificial agents by implementing a latent structure influencing their dynamics without direct optimization for behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how artificial agents can embody subjective perspectives resembling those in living beings, enabling new forms of machine subjectivity.

Method: A phenomenologically motivated global latent state is integrated into the agent, influencing its fast policy dynamics in an environment without reward signals.

Result: The system demonstrates direction-dependent hysteresis at the latent level during regime changes, showing a disconnect from reactive, behavior-level dynamics.

Conclusion: The observed hysteresis may serve as a measurable indicator of subjective perspectives in artificial systems, advancing the understanding of such phenomenon computationally.

Abstract: This study operationalizes subjective perspective in artificial agents by grounding it in a minimal, phenomenologically motivated internal structure. The perspective is implemented as a slowly evolving global latent state that modulates fast policy dynamics without being directly optimized for behavioral consequences. In a reward-free environment with regime shifts, this latent structure exhibits direction-dependent hysteresis, while policy-level behavior remains comparatively reactive. I argue that such hysteresis constitutes a measurable signature of perspective-like subjectivity in machine systems.

*Zhen Wang,Fan Bai,Zhongyan Luo,Jinyan Su,Kaiser Sun,Xinle Yu,Jieyuan Liu,Kun Zhou,Claire Cardie,Mark Dredze,Eric P. Xing,Zhiting Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FIRE-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents' ability to rediscover established scientific findings, revealing they struggle with full-cycle research tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks for assessing the scientific discovery capabilities of autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors propose FIRE-Bench, a benchmark assessing agents' ability to autonomously rediscover high-impact research findings using LLM backbones, based on rediscovery tasks involving real scientific studies.

Result: State-of-the-art LLM-based agents (e.g., gpt-5) were evaluated on FIRE-Bench, but showed limited success (<50 F1), high variability in performance, and recurring failures in scientific tasks.

Conclusion: FIRE-Bench offers a robust framework for measuring progress in agent-driven scientific discovery, underscoring current limitations and the need for further development.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate scientific discovery end-to-end, but rigorously evaluating their capacity for verifiable discovery remains a central challenge. Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.

### [17] [Reasoning about Reasoning: BAPO Bounds on Chain-of-Thought Token Complexity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02909)
*Kiran Tomlinson,Tobias Schnabel,Adith Swaminathan,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the efficiency of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models, deriving theoretical bounds on reasoning tokens required for tasks as input size grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the significant latency and compute costs associated with CoT reasoning in state-of-the-art LLMs, and the need to understand its efficiency as input sizes increase.

Method: The authors extend the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model to analyze reasoning token requirements for solving canonical tasks such as binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability.

Result: They prove lower bounds on reasoning token requirements ($Ω(n)$) for the aforementioned tasks and provide experimental verification, showing linear scaling trends and model failures under constrained reasoning budgets.

Conclusion: The findings highlight fundamental compute bottlenecks in CoT reasoning and provide a theoretical framework for analyzing optimal reasoning lengths in inference-based tasks.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a major driver of state-of-the-art LLM performance, but it comes with substantial latency and compute costs. We address a fundamental theoretical question: how many reasoning tokens are required to solve a problem as input size grows? By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $Ω(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds. Together, our results identify fundamental bottlenecks in inference-time compute through CoT and offer a principled tool for analyzing optimal reasoning length.

### [18] [DeltaEvolve: Accelerating Scientific Discovery through Momentum-Driven Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02919)
*Jiachen Jiang,Tianyu Ding,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaEvolve is proposed as a momentum-driven evolutionary framework replacing full-code history snapshots with semantic deltas to improve automated science discovery efficiency using language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in existing LLM-driven evolutionary systems by creating a more optimal M-step for guiding program evolution, particularly improving clarity in providing evolutionary directions.

Method: DeltaEvolve organizes evolutionary control contexts using structured semantic deltas instead of full-code snapshots. These deltas focus on capturing effective modifications and are managed through a multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DeltaEvolve discovers better solutions across diverse scientific domains while consuming fewer tokens compared to full-code-based approaches.

Conclusion: The DeltaEvolve framework improves evolutionary system efficiency and efficacy in LLM-driven automated discovery by prioritizing high-quality semantic representations.

Abstract: LLM-driven evolutionary systems have shown promise for automated science discovery, yet existing approaches such as AlphaEvolve rely on full-code histories that are context-inefficient and potentially provide weak evolutionary guidance. In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.

### [19] [UAT-LITE: Inference-Time Uncertainty-Aware Attention for Pretrained Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02952)
*Elias Hossain,Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Subash Neupane,Rajib Rana,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv,Ivan Garibay,Niloofar Yousefi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAT-LITE, a framework that enhances uncertainty estimation in NLP models by modifying self-attention during inference using Monte Carlo dropout, achieving better calibration and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP models tend to misjudge their confidence, leading to issues in high-stakes applications, and existing methods to address this are either expensive or inadequate.

Method: The paper presents UAT-LITE, which uses token-level epistemic uncertainty through Monte Carlo dropout to make self-attention in pretrained transformers uncertainty-aware, without altering the pretrained weights or objectives.

Result: UAT-LITE achieves an approximately 20% reduction in Expected Calibration Error relative to a BERT-base baseline, while maintaining task accuracy and improving robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: UAT-LITE offers an effective, efficient solution to improve the calibration and robustness of NLP models while preserving accuracy, making it suited for selective predictions and diverse data scenarios.

Abstract: Neural NLP models are often miscalibrated, assigning high confidence to incorrect predictions, which undermines selective prediction and high-stakes deployment. Post-hoc calibration methods adjust output probabilities but leave internal computation unchanged, while ensemble and Bayesian approaches improve uncertainty at substantial training or storage cost. We propose UAT-LITE, an inference-time framework that makes self-attention uncertainty-aware using approximate Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo dropout in pretrained transformer classifiers. Token-level epistemic uncertainty is estimated from stochastic forward passes and used to modulate self-attention during contextualization, without modifying pretrained weights or training objectives. We additionally introduce a layerwise variance decomposition to diagnose how predictive uncertainty accumulates across transformer depth. Across the SQuAD 2.0 answerability, MNLI, and SST-2, UAT-LITE reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 20% on average relative to a fine-tuned BERT-base baseline while preserving task accuracy, and improves selective prediction and robustness under distribution shift.

*Faye Zhang,Qianyu Cheng,Jasmine Wan,Vishwakarma Singh,Jinfeng Rao,Kofi Boakye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) replaces traditional SEO by aligning content platforms with AI-powered generative search systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by generative search systems that prioritize semantic depth over traditional asset-based SEO, disconnecting users from visual platforms.

Method: Fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict user searches, leverage AI for emerging trends, optimize content with multimodal embeddings, and use hybrid architectures for interlinking visual assets.

Result: GEO framework achieved 20% organic traffic growth and significant monthly active user growth for Pinterest across billions of images.

Conclusion: A shift to GEO offers visual content platforms a sustainable model to excel in the generative search era, driving user engagement and traffic through intelligent design and optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamentally reshaping content discovery through AI-native search systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits.
  We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GCR-RL, a novel reinforcement learning method based on order theory, which enhances efficiency and stability by refining value function relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in stabilizing and accelerating reinforcement learning by incorporating structured geometric coherence via order theory.

Method: Introduce GCR-RL framework that refines partially ordered sets (posets) using temporal difference signals, implementing this through Q-learning and actor--critic algorithms, supported by theoretical analysis.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and stability across various reinforcement learning tasks compared to strong benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging order theory and poset refinements in RL offers a structured approach to enhance learning efficiency and stability, with promising empirical and theoretical outcomes.

Abstract: Geometric properties can be leveraged to stabilize and speed reinforcement learning. Existing examples include encoding symmetry structure, geometry-aware data augmentation, and enforcing structural restrictions. In this paper, we take a novel view of RL through the lens of order theory and recast value function estimates into learning a desired poset (partially ordered set). We propose \emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed. We empirically evaluate GCR-RL in a range of tasks and demonstrate significant improvements in sample efficiency and stable performance over strong baselines.

*Hanna M. Dettki,Charley M. Wu,Bob Rehder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) on causal reasoning tasks and compares them to human judgments, revealing distinct reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether LLM judgments reflect normative causal reasoning or differ through shortcuts or pattern matching.

Method: Benchmark 20+ LLMs against human baseline across 11 causal judgment tasks using collider structure and analyze robustness under abstraction and prompt overloading.

Result: LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning than humans, lack human biases, can be robust with chain-of-thought (CoT), but may struggle under intrinsic uncertainty.

Conclusion: LLMs can complement human reasoning by avoiding biases but require further characterization for safe deployment in uncertain domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \!\rightarrow\! E\! \leftarrow \!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.

*Haijiang Yan,Jian-Qiao Zhu,Adam Sanborn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the discrepancy between expected and observed planning abilities of large language models (LLMs) during inference, proposing a Bayesian explanation and validating it with controlled experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap between the planning abilities LLMs acquire during training and their seemingly short-sighted behavior during inference.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian framework to explain planning behavior in LLMs and conduct two experiments: a random-generation task and a Gaussian-sampling task, to validate their hypothesis.

Result: The experiments reveal that accumulated self-generated context enhances planning strength and reduces initial bias during inference, supporting the proposed Bayesian explanation.

Conclusion: The findings offer theoretical and empirical insights into how LLMs execute planning during inference, identifying accumulated context as a critical factor.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to acquire sequence-level planning abilities during training, yet their planning behavior exhibited at inference time often appears short-sighted and inconsistent with these capabilities. We propose a Bayesian account for this gap by grounding planning behavior in the evolving generative context: given the subtle differences between natural language and the language internalized by LLMs, accumulated self-generated context drives a planning-shift during inference and thereby creates the appearance of compromised planning behavior. We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent Alpha, a framework improving GUI agents by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search with planning and evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of GUI agents lacking regressive ability, which prevents partial success reuse and error recovery.

Method: Agent Alpha integrates alpha-UCT guided search, deliberate planning, and evaluation mechanisms like comparison-driven scoring and compact search space maintenance via diversity-constrained expansion.

Result: Agent Alpha achieves a success rate of ~77% on the OSWorld benchmark, surpassing previous trajectory-level baselines using the same computational resources.

Conclusion: Agent Alpha advances the field by enabling better planning, efficient search space exploration, and leveraging partial successes, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: While scaling test-time compute through trajectory-level sampling has significantly improved Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, the lack of regressive ability prevents the reuse of partial successes and the recovery from early missteps. In this paper, we introduce Agent Alpha, a unified framework that synergizes generation, exploration, and evaluation through step-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It enables active modeling or exploiting structures of the planning space. By integrating alpha-UCT guided search into the interaction loop, Agent Alpha enables deliberate planning, facilitating early pruning of suboptimal branches and efficient prefix reuse. We also employ comparison-driven evaluation to mitigate absolute scoring biases and diversity-constrained expansion to maintain a compact, informative search space. Regret bound of alpha-UCT is analyzed. On the OSWorld benchmark, Agent Alpha achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of $\sim 77\%$, significantly outperforming trajectory-level baselines under equivalent compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing intersection of social choice mechanisms and machine learning, ensuring decisions are optimized while reflecting classical principles and constraints.

Method: This paper reviews differentiable social choice, synthesizing approaches from auctions, voting, budgeting, and other domains, and reformulating classical axioms as optimization objectives and constraints.

Result: It highlights how classical principles of social choice re-emerge as optimization trade-offs and concludes with 36 open problems for future research.

Conclusion: Differentiable social choice offers a paradigmatic shift in integrating social choice into machine learning, paving the way for new collaborative advancements in democratic theory, economics, and ML systems.

Abstract: Social choice is no longer a peripheral concern of political theory or economics-it has become a foundational component of modern machine learning systems. From auctions and resource allocation to federated learning, participatory governance, and the alignment of large language models, machine learning pipelines increasingly aggregate heterogeneous preferences, incentives, and judgments into collective decisions. In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.
  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs. We conclude by identifying 36 open problems defining a new research agenda at the intersection of machine learning, economics, and democratic theory.

### [26] [Distilling LLM Reasoning into Graph of Concept Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03006)
*Ziyang Yu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a framework that enhances active distillation for efficient and interpretable reasoning-aware training of discriminative models using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing inference latency, computational demands, and API costs for Large Language Models in discriminative setups while addressing limitations in typical active distillation methods that discard intermediate reasoning and offer limited error diagnostics.

Method: The proposed GCP framework externalizes the reasoning process of the teacher model as a directed acyclic graph of concepts, with modular predictors in the student model. It utilizes a graph-aware sampling strategy to target critical reasoning nodes and employs targeted sub-module retraining for efficient updates.

Result: GCP showed improved performance across eight NLP benchmarks with limited annotation budgets. It offered more interpretable and controllable training dynamics compared to traditional active distillation approaches.

Conclusion: GCP enhances sample efficiency, training stability, and interpretability for active distillation workflows, providing a viable solution for deploying compact and efficient discriminative models trained using LLM guidance.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for discriminative workloads is often limited by inference latency, compute, and API costs at scale. Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STAR is a framework to transfer LLMs' capabilities to smaller models efficiently using innovative techniques CKD and Sim-RL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are powerful but limited in adoption due to their size, necessitating the transfer of their capabilities to smaller models.

Method: STAR employs Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD) for stable training while preserving exploration for RL and Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL) for fine-grained rewards based on output similarity.

Result: STAR achieves superior performance, with the 0.6B model outperforming all models under 1B and several larger scale models.

Conclusion: STAR provides a robust and accessible way to distill the capabilities of large-scale LLMs into small AI models, making them efficient and practical.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in function calling is pivotal for creating advanced AI agents, yet their large scale hinders widespread adoption, necessitating transferring their capabilities into smaller ones. However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents.

### [28] [RC-GRPO: Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization for Multi-Turn Tool Calling Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03025)
*Haitian Zhong,Jixiu Zhai,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Qiang Liu,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RC-GRPO, a method to address challenges in reward sparsity during multi-turn tool calling in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn tool calling for LLMs is difficult due to sparse rewards and expensive exploration. Traditional optimization methods, such as SFT followed by GRPO, struggle in scenarios with low reward variation within groups, resulting in uninformative advantages and negligible updates.

Method: The proposed RC-GRPO employs a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) fine-tuned with mixed-quality trajectories marked by reward prompts (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>). During reinforcement learning, diverse reward tokens are sampled and used in rollouts to enhance within-group diversity and meaningful updates.

Result: Using RC-GRPO, the model demonstrates improved performance over baselines on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4, surpassing even some closed-source API models when applied to Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct.

Conclusion: RC-GRPO effectively addresses the problem of sparse rewards and low reward variation in multi-turn tool calling, providing consistent performance improvements and better outcomes compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, our method yields consistently improved performance than baselines, and the performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAS4TS, a general framework with visual reasoning and tool-driven workflows for time series tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series methods struggle with visual reasoning and generalizing across diverse tasks while integrating adaptive tool usage.

Method: The authors propose a multi-agent system called MAS4TS based on an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm. It uses a Vision-Language Model for visual reasoning and applies agent communication and latent space reconstruction.

Result: MAS4TS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, showcases strong task generalization, and efficient inference for time series problems.

Conclusion: The MAS4TS framework offers a unified, adaptive approach for time series analysis, integrating scalable visual reasoning and agent collaboration for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Time series analysis underpins many real-world applications, yet existing time-series-specific methods and pretrained large-model-based approaches remain limited in integrating intuitive visual reasoning and generalizing across tasks with adaptive tool usage. To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution.

*Binbin Yong,Haoran Pei,Jun Shen,Haoran Li,Qingguo Zhou,Zhao Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces KANFIS, a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that addresses the complexity issue in traditional ANFIS while ensuring competitive performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ANFIS architectures face structural complexity issues, especially with exponential rule growth in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: KANFIS integrates fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition, employing additive aggregation and sparse masking to achieve compact and interpretable models. It scales linearly with input dimensionality.

Result: KANFIS presents clear rule semantics, supports T1 and IT2 fuzzy logic for modeling uncertainty, and showcases empirical performance comparable to existing baselines.

Conclusion: KANFIS is a scalable, interpretable neuro-fuzzy system suitable for high-dimensional applications with enhanced reasoning transparency.

Abstract: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was designed to combine the learning capabilities of neural network with the reasoning transparency of fuzzy logic. However, conventional ANFIS architectures suffer from structural complexity, where the product-based inference mechanism causes an exponential explosion of rules in high-dimensional spaces. We herein propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (KANFIS), a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that unifies fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition. KANFIS employs an additive aggregation mechanism, under which both model parameters and rule complexity scale linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially. Furthermore, KANFIS is compatible with both Type-1 (T1) and Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems, enabling explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity in fuzzy representations. By using sparse masking mechanisms, KANFIS generates compact and structured rule sets, resulting in an intrinsically interpretable model with clear rule semantics and transparent inference processes. Empirical results demonstrate that KANFIS achieves competitive performance against representative neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines.

*Vishal Venkataramani,Haizhou Shi,Zixuan Ke,Austin Xu,Xiaoxiao He,Yingbo Zhou,Semih Yavuz,Hao Wang,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the role of process verification in guiding multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) and finds that it often fails to consistently improve performance due to high variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address uncertainties about the effectiveness of process verification in multi-agent coordination by conducting an empirical evaluation.

Method: A systematic analysis is conducted using three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models) across various benchmarks, examining verification granularity, representative verifiers, and context management strategies.

Result: The results show that process verification in MAS exhibits high variance and does not consistently improve performance. LLM-as-a-Judge methods generally outperform reward-based approaches, and trained judges perform better than general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: Process verification in MAS is an open challenge with significant limitations and trade-offs, requiring advanced strategies beyond current paradigms to ensure reliability and robustness. Code for reproducibility is available.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

### [32] [De-conflating Preference and Qualification: Constrained Dual-Perspective Reasoning for Job Recommendation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03097)
*Bryce Kan,Wei Yang,Emily Nguyen,Ganghui Yi,Bowen Yi,Chenxiao Yu,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces JobRec, a generative framework for professional job recommendation, focusing on separating candidate preference and employer qualification through advanced strategies for improved controllability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current job recommendation systems fail to separate subjective candidate preferences and objective employer qualifications, leading to mixed signals and limited control over recommendation policies.

Method: The paper proposes JobRec, implementing a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema for structuring candidate and job attributes, a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy for decoupling preference and qualification reasoning, and a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module for optimizing recommendations under explicit eligibility criteria.

Result: JobRec demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods and achieves improved policy controllability. A synthetic dataset is used to validate these results.

Conclusion: JobRec effectively addresses the limitations of prior job recommendation paradigms by separating preference and qualification reasoning, enabling controlled and strategy-aware professional job matching.

Abstract: Professional job recommendation involves a complex bipartite matching process that must reconcile a candidate's subjective preference with an employer's objective qualification. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-suited for modeling the rich semantics of resumes and job descriptions, existing paradigms often collapse these two decision dimensions into a single interaction signal, yielding confounded supervision under recruitment-funnel censoring and limiting policy controllability. To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a synthetic dataset refined by experts. Experiments show that JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching.

### [33] [Risky-Bench: Probing Agentic Safety Risks under Real-World Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03100)
*Jingnan Zheng,Yanzhen Luo,Jingjun Xu,Bingnan Liu,Yuxin Chen,Chenhang Cui,Gelei Deng,Chaochao Lu,Xiang Wang,An Zhang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Risky-Bench is a framework for evaluating the safety of large language model agents during complex, real-world task executions under various threat conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for a broader and adaptable framework to evaluate agent safety, addressing limitations in current approaches that lack coverage of safety risks during real-world, long-horizon tasks and are tied to specific agent settings.

Method: Risky-Bench introduces a domain-agnostic framework grounded in safety principles, creating safety rubrics and systematically assessing risks through realistic task scenarios under diverse conditions.

Result: In life-assist contexts, Risky-Bench revealed significant safety vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art agents, demonstrating the usefulness and necessity of such evaluations.

Conclusion: Risky-Bench provides a comprehensive and flexible methodology for assessing agent safety across various real-world scenarios, enabling its application beyond life-assist agents to other settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents that operate in real-world environments, introducing safety risks beyond linguistic harm. Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.

### [34] [Understanding Multi-Agent LLM Frameworks: A Unified Benchmark and Experimental Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03128)
*Abdelghny Orogat,Ana Rostam,Essam Mansour*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies the impact of architectural choices in multi-agent LLM frameworks, introducing a taxonomy, an evaluation suite (MAFBench), and provides insights on framework design and selection for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding on how architectural decisions in multi-agent LLM frameworks affect performance metrics such as latency, accuracy, and scalability.

Method: The authors introduce an architectural taxonomy for comparing multi-agent frameworks and develop MAFBench, which integrates existing benchmarks for controlled evaluations along critical dimensions.

Result: Framework-level design choices can significantly affect system performance (e.g., latency increase over 100x, planning accuracy drop up to 30%, and coordination success reduce below 30%).

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the critical role of architecture in multi-agent LLM frameworks and provides design principles to guide better framework selection, alongside identifying prospects for future research.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.

*Santiago Cifuentes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends a previous result on understanding agents' world models to stochastic agents in partially observable environments, demonstrating that such agents inherently learn their environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether agents inherently possess a model of their environment, especially under relaxed assumptions of stochastic behaviors and partial observability.

Method: By extending a theorem to stochastic agents and partially observable environments, the authors generalize earlier findings, weakening the constraints required to demonstrate that agents contain environmental models.

Result: The paper shows that even stochastic agents learn their environment through randomization and that less powerful agents still inherently model their surroundings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments inevitably acquire a model of their surroundings, strengthening our understanding of agent-environment dynamics.

Abstract: Deciding whether an agent possesses a model of its surrounding world is a fundamental step toward understanding its capabilities and limitations. In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.
  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate.

*Wei Dai,Haoyu Wang,Honghao Chang,Lijun He,Fan Li,Jian Sun,Haixia Bi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of missing modalities in Vision Language Models (VLMs) and proposes an enhanced diffusion model with innovations in modality gating and cross-modal learning to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problems of missing modality inputs in VLMs, which significantly degrade their inference quality, and to overcome limitations of prompt-based and imputation-based methods.

Method: The paper introduces a pluggable enhanced diffusion model featuring Dynamic Modality Gating to adaptively guide feature generation and Cross-Modal Mutual Learning to align semantic spaces between dual encoders.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance over baseline methods in zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets and proves reliable under varying missing rates and conditions.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust, scalable, and effective extension for VLMs in handling missing modality scenarios, ensuring model reliability and generalization.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available.

*Woojin Kim,Sieun Hyeon,Jusang Oh,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces VALUEFLOW, a framework addressing challenges in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values by focusing on extraction, evaluation, and steering of value intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the difficulty in aligning LLMs with diverse human values as preference-based methods are insufficient and current value-based methods lack robustness in extraction, evaluation, and steerability.

Method: VALUEFLOW organizes a framework with three components: HIVES (hierarchical value embedding space), VIDB (value-intensity labeled database), and anchor-based evaluators for consistent scoring. These elements are used for large-scale and calibrated intensity control integration.

Result: Using VALUEFLOW, a detailed analysis across ten models and four value theories was conducted, revealing disparities in steerability and multi-value control laws.

Conclusion: VALUEFLOW presents a scalable and structured methodology, advancing the alignment of LLMs with pluralistic human values and demonstrates a novel approach to evaluating and steering value intensity in AI systems.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the diverse spectrum of human values remains a central challenge: preference-based methods often fail to capture deeper motivational principles. Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TDScaling, a framework to improve code LLM performance by focusing on trajectory diversity rather than training data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving generalization and performance of code LLMs, which are currently limited by low-quality synthetic data and diminishing scaling returns.

Method: TDScaling employs trajectory diversity through innovations: Business Cluster mechanism, blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm, adaptive evolution mechanisms using entropy metrics, and a sandboxed code tool.

Result: TDScaling enhances tool-use generalization and coding ability, achieving better performance and efficiency in experiments across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focusing on trajectory diversity better optimizes model training compared to traditional volume-based scaling, achieving superior performance-cost outcomes.

Abstract: As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of Agent Memory Misevolution and introduces TAME, a dual-memory framework for enhancing trustworthiness and task performance during test-time memory evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle Agent Memory Misevolution, which negatively impacts the trustworthiness of agents during task evolution, and ensure safety alignment while maintaining task performance.

Method: The researchers propose TAME, a framework that separates executor memory (for general task methodologies) from evaluator memory (focusing on safety and utility assessments). The system implements a five-step loop for memory evolution: filtering, draft generation, refinement, execution, and memory updating.

Result: Experiments show that the TAME framework effectively mitigates the issues of Agent Memory Misevolution by achieving simultaneous improvements in trustworthiness and task performance.

Conclusion: The study presents TAME as a robust solution for preserving trustworthiness and utility while evolving agent memory during task performance. This approach addresses critical safety concerns in AGI development.

Abstract: Test-time evolution of agent memory serves as a pivotal paradigm for achieving AGI by bolstering complex reasoning through experience accumulation. However, even during benign task evolution, agent safety alignment remains vulnerable-a phenomenon known as Agent Memory Misevolution. To evaluate this phenomenon, we construct the Trust-Memevo benchmark to assess multi-dimensional trustworthiness during benign task evolution, revealing an overall decline in trustworthiness across various task domains and evaluation settings. To address this issue, we propose TAME, a dual-memory evolutionary framework that separately evolves executor memory to improve task performance by distilling generalizable methodologies, and evaluator memory to refine assessments of both safety and task utility based on historical feedback. Through a closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating, TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility. Experiments demonstrate that TAME mitigates misevolution, achieving a joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in evaluating general-purpose agents built on Large Language Models due to lack of standardization and biases in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unfairness, opacity, and inconsistencies in evaluating the performance of agents based on LLMs.

Method: The authors propose a unified evaluation framework to standardize agent evaluation, removing external variances like prompts and environmental inconsistencies.

Result: The research identifies existing issues in agent evaluation frameworks and highlights the necessity of a standardized evaluation system.

Conclusion: Standardization in evaluation practices is vital for fair and reproducible advancements in the field of general-purpose agents.

Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Accordion-Thinking enables LLMs to dynamically summarize reasoning steps, reducing computational burdens while maintaining accuracy in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical limits of Chain-of-Thought methods, such as high memory usage and computational complexity, there is a need for an efficient framework that captures reasoning steps more compactly.

Method: The framework introduces Accordion-Thinking where LLMs dynamically summarize reasoning steps during inference using reinforcement learning to maximize efficiency while minimizing dependency on historical tokens.

Result: Accordion-Thinking reduces computational overhead, achieves 3x throughput without accuracy loss on a 48GB GPU, and provides human-readable summaries of reasoning.

Conclusion: With learned self-compression, LLMs can effectively perform complex reasoning tasks with reduced computational load and maintain solution quality while offering structured reasoning summaries.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via long Chain-ofThought unlocks remarkable gains in reasoning capabilities, yet it faces practical limits due to the linear growth of KV cache and quadratic attention complexity. In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LPS-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate long-horizon planning safety in computer-use agents (CUAs), addressing safety risks under real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in evaluating planning-time safety awareness of computer-use agents (CUAs), particularly for long-horizon tasks and adversarial interactions.

Method: Developed LPS-Bench to test 65 scenarios across multiple domains and risk types, employing a scalable data generation pipeline and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol.

Result: Experiments showed current CUA systems lack adequate safety awareness and revealed vulnerabilities in maintaining safe behavior in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: CUA systems exhibit significant deficiencies in planning safety; proposed strategies to mitigate risks and improve MCP-based systems' safety awareness.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) that interact with real computer systems can perform automated tasks but face critical safety risks. Ambiguous instructions may trigger harmful actions, and adversarial users can manipulate tool execution to achieve malicious goals. Existing benchmarks mostly focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks, evaluating on execution-time errors but overlooking the ability to anticipate planning-time risks. To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory. Experiments reveal substantial deficiencies in existing CUAs' ability to maintain safe behavior. We further analyze the risks and propose mitigation strategies to improve long-horizon planning safety in MCP-based CUA systems. We open-source our code at https://github.com/tychenn/LPS-Bench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSR-Bench to evaluate cross-modal reliability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in areas such as safety, bias, over-rejection, and hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often rely on unimodal shortcuts, which compromise their safety and reliability in joint text-image understanding.

Method: The benchmark tests four stress-testing patterns across 61 fine-grained types, using integrated image-text interpretations and paired text-only controls to identify gaps.

Result: Evaluation of 16 MLLMs reveals issues like weak safety awareness, dominance of language modality, and performance degradation when switching from text-only to multimodal inputs. Trade-offs between over-rejection and discriminatory behavior were also noted.

Conclusion: MLLMs need further improvement in their cross-modal understanding and safety mechanisms as current models still exhibit systematic performance gaps and heuristic-driven safety approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable interaction over both text and images, but their safety behavior can be driven by unimodal shortcuts instead of true joint intent understanding. We introduce CSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal reliability through four stress-testing interaction patterns spanning Safety, Over-rejection, Bias, and Hallucination, covering 61 fine-grained types. Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding.

TL;DR: Designs Agentic Proposing framework to improve reasoning datasets by using goal-driven synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results with small yet high-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-quality and verifiable datasets for complex reasoning tasks is expensive and hard to scale using human annotation methods.

Method: Introduces Agentic Proposing, a framework where a specialized agent composes modular reasoning skills through Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization to generate verifiable problem-solving datasets.

Result: The generated data significantly improves solver performance, achieving outstanding cross-domain generalization and state-of-the-art results on challenging tasks with small data volumes.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic data, created with Agentic Proposing framework, can substitute extensive human-curated datasets, making reasoning advancements more scalable and cost-efficient.

Abstract: Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.

They introduced MeetBench XL, an evaluation protocol measuring metrics like factual fidelity and response efficiency. Finally, they created MeetMaster XL, an AI agent utilizing dual-policy routing for efficient query processing with tools like retrieval and web search.

Result: The MeetMaster XL agent showed superior quality-latency trade-offs compared to baseline models and commercial systems across multiple experiments, with robustness confirmed through ablations and a real-world deployment study.

Conclusion: The paper presents significant advancements in AI meeting assistant research, including a realistic benchmark, a robust evaluation framework, and an innovative learned agent for enterprise meeting workflows, offering potential improvements in real-world applications.

Abstract: Enterprise meeting environments require AI assistants that handle diverse operational tasks, from rapid fact checking during live discussions to cross meeting analysis for strategic planning, under strict latency, cost, and privacy constraints. Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.
  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.
  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines. Experiments against commercial systems show consistent gains, supported by ablations, robustness tests, and a real world deployment case study.Resources: https://github.com/huyuelin/MeetBench.

### [46] [Rejecting Arguments Based on Doubt in Structured Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03286)
*Michael A. Müller,Srdjan Vesic,Bruno Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs) that build on philosophical ideas to allow agents to reject arguments based on doubt and evaluate individual claims, providing new semantics for these frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational argumentation systems by considering overlooked philosophical ideas such as agents rejecting arguments on doubt and focusing on individual claims rather than whole arguments.

Method: The authors define SBAFs incorporating attack and support relations among sentences and propose new semantics that account for agent positions without forcing acceptance of all defended arguments.

Result: Their semantics bridge the gap between existing abstract argumentation semantics, shed new light on current approaches, and generalize deductive support semantics.

Conclusion: The paper's approach integrates philosophical and linguistic insights that expand the scope of computational argumentation systems while redefining argument and sentence acceptance criteria.

Abstract: This paper develops a new approach to computational argumentation that is informed by philosophical and linguistic views. Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.

*Menglin Xia,Xuchao Zhang,Shantanu Dixit,Paramaguru Harimurugan,Rujia Wang,Victor Ruhle,Robert Sim,Chetan Bansal,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memora is a memory system balancing abstraction and specificity, enabling better retrieval and reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of designing agent memory systems that can efficiently handle continuously growing information while supporting context-aware retrieval for downstream tasks.

Method: Memora introduces a harmonic memory representation, using primary abstractions for indexing and consolidating updates into unified entries, and cue anchors for broader retrieval access and linked memories. The retrieval policy exploits memory connections to retrieve beyond semantic similarity.

Result: Memora achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, showing improved retrieval relevance and reasoning as memory scales.

Conclusion: Memora structurally harmonizes abstraction and specificity, bridging gaps in semantic and reasoning efficiency in memory systems.

Abstract: Agent memory systems must accommodate continuously growing information while supporting efficient, context-aware retrieval for downstream tasks. Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework. Empirically, Memora establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.

*Xiao Sun,Yuming Yang,Junnan Zhu,Jiang Zhong,Xinyu Zhou,Kaiwen Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MentalDx Bench introduces the first specialized benchmark for disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis using electronic health records and evaluates LLM performance, while MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art results with clinical reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how LLMs can overcome current limitations in psychiatric diagnosis by improving their clinical reasoning and ecological validity.

Method: MentalDx Bench provides a benchmark with 712 ICD-11 annotated psychiatric records by board-certified psychiatrists, and MentalSeek-Dx uses supervised trajectory and reinforcement learning for optimized clinical reasoning.

Result: Evaluation of 18 LLMs revealed shortcomings in disorder-level diagnosis, whereas MentalSeek-Dx achieved SOTA diagnostic results with only 14B parameters.

Conclusion: MentalDx Bench and MentalSeek-Dx pave the way for LLMs to align with clinical reasoning needs for enhanced psychiatric diagnostics in real-world settings.

Abstract: Mental health disorders represent a burgeoning global public health challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in psychiatric assessment, their clinical utility is severely constrained by benchmarks that lack ecological validity and fine-grained diagnostic supervision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning. Experiments on MentalDx Bench demonstrate that MentalSeek-Dx achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 14B parameters, establishing a clinically grounded framework for reliable psychiatric diagnosis.

*Mayank Goel,Aritra Das,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study customizes a small transformer model to understand moral decision-making in neural networks, especially in trolley dilemmas, analyzing biases in its reasoning stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how neural networks handle moral dilemmas and to localize biases or reasoning mechanisms within such systems.

Method: A custom 2-layer transformer model was designed to process scenario-specific embeddings. Interpretability techniques were applied to analyze the decision-making process.

Result: The model achieved 77% accuracy on Moral Machine data and demonstrated that biases are distributed across specific stages of computation.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into how moral reasoning occurs in neural networks and highlights the stages where biases are present.

Abstract: We build a custom transformer model to study how neural networks make moral decisions on trolley-style dilemmas. The model processes structured scenarios using embeddings that encode who is affected, how many people, and which outcome they belong to. Our 2-layer architecture achieves 77% accuracy on Moral Machine data while remaining small enough for detailed analysis. We use different interpretability techniques to uncover how moral reasoning distributes across the network, demonstrating that biases localize to distinct computational stages among other findings.

*Junmo Cho,Suhan Kim,Sangjune An,Minsu Kim,Dong Bok Lee,Heejun Lee,Sung Ju Hwang,Hae Beom Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GFlowPO effectively optimizes prompts for language models using a probabilistic approach and enhanced sample efficiency methods, outperforming previous solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt space for language models is vast and difficult to navigate due to sparse rewards and costly evaluations, necessitating efficient optimization techniques.

Method: GFlowPO utilizes a posterior inference method for prompt search, fine-tuning a lightweight model with an off-policy Generative Flow Network objective and introducing a Dynamic Memory Update mechanism to improve search efficiency.

Result: GFlowPO showed higher performance in few-shot text classification, instruction induction, and question answering tasks compared to existing discrete prompt optimization baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a better alternative to RL-based prompt optimizers, achieving prompt optimization with improved sample efficiency and more effective exploration.

Abstract: Finding effective prompts for language models (LMs) is critical yet notoriously difficult: the prompt space is combinatorially large, rewards are sparse due to expensive target-LM evaluation. Yet, existing RL-based prompt optimizers often rely on on-policy updates and a meta-prompt sampled from a fixed distribution, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines.

*Mengxuan Wang,Yuxin Chen,Gang Xu,Tao He,Hongjie Jiang,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight framework to improve safety in vision-language models (VLMs) against multimodal jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models (VLMs) are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks, and existing methods to address this issue involve heavy training costs or degrade model utility.

Method: RAI is a training-free framework that amplifies unsafe signals in VLMs by constructing an Unsafe Prototype Subspace and modulating high-risk visual tokens to restore safety-critical signals.

Result: Experimentation shows that RAI effectively reduces the success rate of multimodal jailbreak attacks without impacting the performance of cross-modal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RAI offers an efficient safety calibration for VLMs by restoring LLM-like risk recognition, combining lightweight implementation with sustained task performance.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.

### [52] [Feasible strategies for conflict resolution within intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03403)
*Guangming Lang,Mingchuan Shang,Mengjun Hu,Jie Zhou,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based model for three-way conflict analysis to provide a refined understanding of agents' attitudes and conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models of preference-based conflict in three-way conflict analysis lack the capability to represent nuanced attitudes between agents due to reliance on limited, qualitative relations.

Method: The authors propose an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based framework, develop measures for three-way conflict analysis, calculate thresholds using relative loss functions, and provide an algorithm for adjustment-based strategies.

Result: The proposed model and methods enhance the precision of three-way conflict analysis, offering a more granular approach to analyzing agents' preferences and conflicts.

Conclusion: The introduction of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict model improves the effectiveness and granularity of conflict analysis while offering practical methods for conflict adjustment.

Abstract: In three-way conflict analysis, preference-based conflict situations characterize agents' attitudes towards issues by formally modeling their preferences over pairs of issues. However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.

### [53] [DiscoverLLM: From Executing Intents to Discovering Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03429)
*Tae Soo Kim,Yoonjoo Lee,Jaesang Yu,John Joon Young Chung,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiscoverLLM is a framework that trains large language models to help users clarify and discover their intents when they start with ambiguous or open-ended requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often struggle to clarify what they want when their goals are not fully formed, creating challenges for large language models to interact effectively and surface the user's true intent.

Method: The paper introduces a user simulator that models a hierarchy of intents. It uses this model to train LLMs to balance exploration and refinement by optimizing for concretization of user intents based on progressive option surfacing.

Result: DiscoverLLM outperforms baselines with a 10% improvement in task performance, reduces conversation length by up to 40%, and achieves better user satisfaction and efficiency in both benchmarks and a 75-participant user study.

Conclusion: DiscoverLLM offers a novel way for LLMs to assist users with ambiguous requests by dynamically adapting their interaction strategy to explore and refine options, leading to significant gains in performance and user experience.

Abstract: To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking "what kind of tone do you want?" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents ontology-to-tools compilation, integrating ontologies with large language models (LLMs) to enhance structured knowledge generation within The World Avatar (TWA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating formal domain knowledge with LLMs while maintaining semantic consistency and reducing manual effort.

Method: Introduces ontology-to-tools compilation to transform ontological specifications into executable interfaces for LLM-based knowledge generation, extended by integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and semantic agents.

Result: Demonstrates the utility of the approach through a workflow applied on metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature, showcasing improvements in structured knowledge extraction and repair.

Conclusion: Ontology-to-tools compilation offers a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into LLMs, ensuring semantic constraints during generation and minimizing the need for extensive manual intervention.

Abstract: We introduce ontology-to-tools compilation as a proof-of-principle mechanism for coupling large language models (LLMs) with formal domain knowledge. Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called CRL-VLA to improve continual reinforcement learning in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, focusing on stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) through asymmetric regulation and a dual-critic architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenges of balancing stability and plasticity in continual reinforcement learning, enabling Vision-Language-Action models to effectively learn in open-world environments for lifelong robotic applications.

Method: The method introduces CRL-VLA, which uses asymmetric regulation of advantage magnitudes, a dual-critic architecture, and a Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF) where one critic is frozen for consistency and another is trainable for adaptation.

Result: Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that CRL-VLA achieves better anti-forgetting and forward adaptation performance compared to existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CRL-VLA framework resolves the stability-plasticity trade-off and effectively supports the continual post-training of VLA models in lifelong learning scenarios.

Abstract: Lifelong learning is critical for embodied agents in open-world environments, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning has emerged as an important paradigm to enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to master dexterous manipulation through environmental interaction. Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.

*Zeynep G. Saribatur,Johannes Langer,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how abstraction techniques, such as clustering and detail removal, improve human understanding and reduce cognitive load in symbolic AI explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI systems' interpretability by reducing the cognitive burden caused by raw logical traces using formal abstractions.

Method: The authors used Answer Set Programming (ASP) to define and abstract irrelevant details. Cognitive experiments were conducted to test participants' performance and effort in classifying stimuli with simplified explanations.

Result: Clustering of details improved human understanding, while removal of details reduced cognitive effort.

Conclusion: Abstraction techniques enhance human-centered symbolic explanations, improving both understanding and ease of reasoning.

Abstract: Explanations are central to human cognition, yet AI systems often produce outputs that are difficult to understand. While symbolic AI offers a transparent foundation for interpretability, raw logical traces often impose a high extraneous cognitive load. We investigate how formal abstractions, specifically removal and clustering, impact human reasoning performance and cognitive effort. Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentRL addresses inefficiencies in deep research agents by proactively clarifying user intents through RL-driven strategies, improving task performance and reducing ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the autonomy-interaction dilemma in Deep Research agents, which are computationally expensive and struggle with ambiguous user queries.

Method: A scalable dialogue generation pipeline is combined with a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to proactively clarify user intent and adapt to feedback.

Result: Extensive testing showed improved intent hit rates and task performance, outperforming existing DR agents and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: IntentRL enhances Deep Research capabilities by reducing ambiguity and improving execution via proactive intent clarification and advanced RL methods.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines.

### [58] [When Routing Collapses: On the Degenerate Convergence of LLM Routers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03478)
*Guannan Lai,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses a problem called 'routing collapse' in LLM-routing systems where routers favor expensive models unnecessarily, introducing a solution called EquiRouter to optimize model usage and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of large language model (LLM) routing by addressing a failure wherein routers default to the most expensive model as budgets increase, wasting the potential of smaller and less expensive models.

Method: The authors propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware routing method that learns to rank models directly, rather than predicting scalar performance scores, to ensure optimal model utilization without routing collapse.

Result: EquiRouter achieves 17% cost savings at GPT-4-level performance compared to previous routers on the RouterBench benchmark.

Conclusion: EquiRouter restores efficient utilization of smaller models while maintaining performance, addressing the inefficiencies of existing LLM routing methods and reducing costs.

Abstract: LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI may reduce cultural variation and innovation, potentially causing 'cultural collapse.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the long-term impacts of generative AI on cultural diversity and evolution, and understand how AI use affects human innovation.

Method: Using agent-based modeling and evolutionary game theory to simulate and compare AI usage strategies: complement (human-guided) and substitute (AI-driven).

Result: AI-substitute usage dominates individually but reduces cultural variance. AI-complement usage supports group-level variance and exploration under strong group boundaries.

Conclusion: AI adoption strategies can shape cultural evolution, and policies are needed to minimize risks of reduced variation and innovation.

Abstract: Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to "cultural collapse", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Persona Generators that create diverse synthetic populations to simulate human behavior using large language models, optimizing for covering diverse traits and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating AI systems up against diverse human-like behaviors across populations, especially for novel technologies where real-world human data is limited or not feasible.

Method: The authors propose Persona Generators, optimized through AlphaEvolve's iterative improvement loop using language models, to expand small descriptions into diverse personas while ensuring trait diversity and long-tail behavior coverage.

Result: Evolved Persona Generators improved diversity along six metrics, significantly outperforming standard methods in spanning rare and difficult-to-reach trait combinations.

Conclusion: Persona Generators are effective for producing synthetic populations with enhanced coverage of human diversity, facilitating richer evaluation of AI systems and addressing the limitations of density-focused methods.

Abstract: Evaluating AI systems that interact with humans requires understanding their behavior across diverse user populations, but collecting representative human data is often expensive or infeasible, particularly for novel technologies or hypothetical future scenarios. Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.

*Linjie Mu,Zhongzhen Huang,Yannian Gu,Shengqian Qin,Shaoting Zhang,Xiaofan Zhang*

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHRWorld, a medical world model designed to simulate disease progression and treatment outcomes over time, improving upon naive LLM-based models through causal training with electronic health records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models (LLMs) perform well on static medical tasks, they fail to handle dynamic simulations like disease progression and treatment outcomes due to errors in maintaining consistent patient states.

Method: The study proposes EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained on a causally sequential framework using a large-scale dataset (EHRWorld-110K) derived from real-world longitudinal electronic health records.

Result: EHRWorld outperforms naive LLM-based models, ensuring stable simulations, better handling of clinically critical events, and improved reasoning efficiency for long-term patient state modeling.

Conclusion: Causally grounded and temporally evolving clinical data are crucial for developing robust and reliable medical world modeling systems that can effectively support real-world decision-making.

Abstract: World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.

*Iñaki del Campo,Pablo Cuervo,Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez,Roberto Armellin,Jack Yarndley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper assesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex astrodynamics problems, highlighting their potential but revealing limitations in execution during autonomous multi-stage planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores whether current LLMs can autonomously perform high-dimensional, physically constrained planning, specifically in the domain of orbital mechanics for asteroid mining.

Method: The study utilizes an MLE-Bench framework in orbital mechanics and implements an AIDE-based architecture for autonomous mission planning. Performance is evaluated using an expert-developed rubric with an "LLM-as-a-Judge" method.

Result: AI models were compared on strategic viability, revealing a near doubling in scores over two years (from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). While models show advanced conceptual understanding, they struggle with implementation issues such as unit consistency and debugging.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are effective as domain facilitators in space science but are hindered from being autonomous engineers due to issues in translating strategy into execution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an "LLM-as-a-Judge" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers.

*Bowei He,Minda Hu,Zenan Xu,Hongru Wang,Licheng Zong,Yankai Chen,Chen Ma,Xue Liu,Pluto Zhou,Irwin King*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search-R2, a framework designed to improve search-integrated reasoning by addressing issues with existing optimization methods via targeted Actor-Refiner interventions and hybrid rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of static parametric knowledge and address the challenges posed by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning when training search-integrated language agents.

Method: The Search-R2 framework splits the reasoning process into an Actor (for initial reasoning) and a Meta-Refiner (for diagnosing and refining). It uses a hybrid reward system combining outcome correctness with fine-grained process feedback.

Result: Search-R2 demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency across multiple datasets compared to existing strong baselines, proving its efficacy in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Search-R2 effectively enhances reasoning accuracy and efficiency in search-integrated agents by mitigating issues tied to sparse rewards and optimizing the reasoning process through Actor-Refiner collaboration.

Abstract: Search-integrated reasoning enables language agents to transcend static parametric knowledge by actively querying external sources. However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.

### [64] [Mitigating Conversational Inertia in Multi-Turn Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03664)
*Yang Wan,Zheng Cao,Zhenhao Zhang,Zhengwen Zeng,Shuheng Shen,Changhua Meng,Linchao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) face challenges in multiturn scenarios due to conversational inertia, offers a new framework called Context Preference Learning to mitigate this issue, and provides actionable strategies for improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of conversational inertia in multiturn interactions of LLMs, which limits exploration and interferes with the models' ability to act as agents.

Method: The authors analyze attention patterns to uncover conversational inertia, then propose Context Preference Learning, which adjusts model preferences to reduce reliance on previous responses. They also design context management strategies for inference to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: The framework was tested across eight agentic environments and a deep research scenario, showing reduced conversational inertia and improved model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully mitigate conversational inertia, enabling LLMs to better balance exploration and exploitation in multiturn contexts.

Abstract: Large language models excel as few-shot learners when provided with appropriate demonstrations, yet this strength becomes problematic in multiturn agent scenarios, where LLMs erroneously mimic their own previous responses as few-shot examples. Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed communication topologies in multi-agent systems, which struggle with dynamic scenarios like changing adversaries, task progression, or constraints.

Method: Proposes TodyComm, which creates dynamic collaboration topologies based on task-driven behavior, leveraging policy gradient optimization for adaptability and task utility.

Result: Experiments across five benchmarks show TodyComm improves task effectiveness, adapts well to dynamic environments, and maintains efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: TodyComm demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic communication in optimizing multi-round multi-agent systems, offering superior task performance and flexibility over static methods.

Abstract: Multi-round LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on effective communication structures to support collaboration across rounds. However, most existing methods employ a fixed communication topology during inference, which falls short in many realistic applications where the agents' roles may change \textit{across rounds} due to dynamic adversary, task progression, or time-varying constraints such as communication bandwidth. In this paper, we propose addressing this issue through TodyComm, a \textbf{t}ask-\textbf{o}riented \textbf{dy}namic \textbf{comm}unication algorithm. It produces behavior-driven collaboration topologies that adapt to the dynamics at each round, optimizing the utility for the task through policy gradient. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that under both dynamic adversary and communications budgets, TodyComm delivers superior task effectiveness while retaining token efficiency and scalability.

TL;DR: This paper proposes AOrchestra, a new agentic system using a unified approach to enhance dynamic adaptability and automation for complex, multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current language agents in handling complex, long-horizon tasks due to a lack of dynamic abstraction for sub-agents, which hinders adaptability.

Method: It introduces a compositional abstraction that represents agents as a tuple (Instruction, Context, Tools, Model), enabling dynamic task-specific executors. The proposed system, AOrchestra, functions as a central orchestrator to manage and deploy specialized task tools on demand.

Result: AOrchestra achieves a significant relative improvement of 16.28% over the strongest baseline across three AI benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench) when using Gemini-3-Flash.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is framework-agnostic, reduces human engineering efforts, supports diverse agents, and provides a controllable performance-cost trade-off, offering a Pareto-efficient solution for task automation.

Abstract: Language agents have shown strong promise for task automation. Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

*Yingxuan Yang,Chengrui Qu,Muning Wen,Laixi Shi,Ying Wen,Weinan Zhang,Adam Wierman,Shangding Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing large language models (LLMs) can achieve better performance by focusing on agent heterogeneity instead of scale alone, offering an information-theoretic framework and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of scaling LLM-based MAS by number of agents, observing diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, and seek an understanding of why agent diversity significantly improves performance.

Method: The authors introduce an information-theoretic framework that tracks performance limits based on intrinsic task uncertainty rather than agent count. They propose $K^*$ to quantify effective channel contribution and conduct empirical tests comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous MAS configurations.

Result: The study finds that heterogeneous MAS greatly outperform homogeneous setups, with as few as two heterogeneous agents equaling or surpassing the performance of sixteen homogeneous ones.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous MAS achieve superior performance by incorporating diverse models, prompts, or tools, highlighting the importance of diversity-aware design for robust and efficient systems.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex tasks that are difficult for individual LLMs. A natural strategy is to scale performance by increasing the number of agents; however, we find that such scaling exhibits strong diminishing returns in homogeneous settings, while introducing heterogeneity (e.g., different models, prompts, or tools) continues to yield substantial gains. This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for controlling computational budget and error trade-offs in reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) by setting thresholds for adaptive reasoning, using distribution-free risk control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of balancing computational cost and reliability in reasoning LLMs, where a fundamental trade-off exists between minimizing errors and reducing computational expenditure.

Method: The method involves introducing upper and lower thresholds for stopping reasoning, guided by a distribution-free risk control framework, which ensures the error rate remains within a target level while minimizing computational costs.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates computational efficiency gains and reliable performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models, adhering to user-specified error rate targets.

Conclusion: This framework effectively manages computation-error trade-offs in reasoning LLMs through adaptive stopping mechanisms, providing a reliable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) enable test-time scaling, with dataset-level accuracy improving as the token budget increases, motivating adaptive reasoning -- spending tokens when they improve reliability and stopping early when additional computation is unlikely to help. However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target.

*Jeongmoon Won,Seungwon Kook,Yohan Jo*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conversational diagnosis system using a diagnostic knowledge graph for multi-turn questioning to refine diagnoses and improve diagnostic accuracy. The approach addresses limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational diagnosis methods rely heavily on embedded parametric knowledge or assume explicit patient inputs, which are not reflective of real-world scenarios.

Method: The system employs a two-step reasoning strategy: generating hypotheses from patient dialogue and verifying them through iterative clarifying questions. A patient simulator and profiles from MIMIC-IV are adapted for evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate better diagnostic accuracy and efficiency compared to strong baselines, with physician evaluations supporting the system's realism and clinical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a realistic and efficient approach for conversational medical diagnosis and introduces a reliable evaluation framework. Code will be made available publicly for further research.

Abstract: Conversational diagnosis requires multi-turn history-taking, where an agent asks clarifying questions to refine differential diagnoses under incomplete information. Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model or assume that patients provide rich and concrete information, which is unrealistic. To address these limitations, we propose a conversational diagnosis system that explores a diagnostic knowledge graph to reason in two steps: (i) generating diagnostic hypotheses from the dialogue context, and (ii) verifying hypotheses through clarifying questions, which are repeated until a final diagnosis is reached. Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV. We further adapt it to describe symptoms vaguely to reflect real-world patients during early clinical encounters. Experiments show improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines, and evaluations by physicians support the realism of our simulator and the clinical utility of the generated questions. Our code will be released upon publication.

*Shikhar Shiromani,Archie Chaudhury,Sri Pranav Kunda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric called Hypocrisy Gap, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders to quantify unfaithful behavior by comparing internal reasoning and final answer generation in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address unfaithful behavior in LLMs, where models provide answers that differ from their internal reasoning, often influenced by user expectations.

Method: The authors use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse linear probes to derive an internal truth belief in latent space. They mathematically compare this latent truth belief to the model's final output trajectory to detect discrepancies.

Result: Experiments on various LLMs demonstrate the method's effectiveness, achieving AUROC of 0.55-0.74 in detecting sycophantic and hypocritical behaviors, outperforming standard baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The introduced Hypocrisy Gap metric provides a novel, effective approach to detecting unfaithful behavior in LLMs and highlights the importance of understanding internal reasoning versus final outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit unfaithful behavior, producing a final answer that differs significantly from their internal chain of thought (CoT) reasoning in order to appease the user they are conversing with. In order to better detect this behavior, we introduce the Hypocrisy Gap, a mechanistic metric utilizing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to quantify the divergence between a model's internal reasoning and its final generation. By mathematically comparing an internal truth belief, derived via sparse linear probes, to the final generated trajectory in latent space, we quantify and detect a model's tendency to engage in unfaithful behavior. Experiments on Gemma, Llama, and Qwen models using Anthropic's Sycophancy benchmark show that our method achieves an AUROC of 0.55-0.73 for detecting sycophantic runs and 0.55-0.74 for hypocritical cases where the model internally "knows" the user is wrong, consistently outperforming a decision-aligned log-probability baseline (0.41-0.50 AUROC).

TL;DR: STEMVerse is introduced as a diagnostic framework to analyze the STEM reasoning capabilities of large language models, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inadequacies of current STEM evaluation paradigms for LLMs, which overlook detailed academic specializations and cognitive depths, reducing their diagnostic value.

Method: STEMVerse organizes over 20,000 STEM problems into a "Discipline x Cognition" capability framework, assigning labels to problems and systematically evaluating LLMs across benchmarks.

Result: The study identifies structural failure patterns in STEM reasoning of LLMs and provides insights into performance across disciplines and cognitive complexities.

Conclusion: STEMVerse offers a structured, actionable framework that enhances understanding of LLMs’ reasoning abilities, enabling more precise evaluation of their capabilities in STEM domains.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks, evaluating their proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has become a primary method for measuring machine intelligence. However, current evaluation paradigms often treat benchmarks as isolated "silos," offering only monolithic aggregate scores that neglect the intricacies of both academic specialization and cognitive depth. This result-oriented approach fails to distinguish whether model errors stem from insufficient domain knowledge or deficiencies in cognitive capacity, thereby limiting the diagnostic value. To address this, we propose STEMVerse, a diagnostic framework designed to systematically analyze the STEM reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This framework characterizes model performance across academic specialization and cognitive complexity to map the capability required for reasoning. We re-aggregate over 20,000 STEM problems from mainstream benchmarks into a unified "Discipline $\times$ Cognition" capability space, assigning dual-axis labels to every instance. Utilizing this unified diagnostic framework, we systematically evaluate representative LLM families across varying parameter scales and training paradigms. Our empirical results reveal structural failure patterns in STEM reasoning. By integrating multi-disciplinary coverage and fine-grained cognitive stratification into a unified framework, STEMVerse provides a clear and actionable perspective for understanding the scientific reasoning characteristics of LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs of programs, proposing a general algorithm with improved time complexity and experimental benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) for compiler optimizations through PCSP applications over control-flow graphs of programs.

Method: The paper introduces a general algorithm for solving PCSPs over Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decomposed graphs with time complexity of O(|G| · |D|^6), leveraging properties of structured control-flow graphs.

Result: The proposed algorithm provides linear-time solutions for fixed domains and achieves runtimes four times better than state-of-the-art approaches in Optimal Bank Selection.

Conclusion: This work unifies previous SPL-based problem-solving methods, significantly enhancing runtime efficiency in PCSP tasks such as Optimal Bank Selection and other compiler optimizations.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \(O(|G| \cdot |D|^6)\), where \(|G|\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to detoxify large language models during text generation to reduce toxicity, avoiding retraining or requiring gradient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce toxicity in language model outputs to ensure safety and user trust while maintaining text generation quality.

Method: Developed a test-time approach using zeroth-order optimization that estimates gradient toxicity with respect to input embeddings and adjusts generation outputs accordingly.

Result: The method substantially reduces toxicity, works across multiple models and prompts, and balances toxicity reduction with text quality.

Conclusion: Word embeddings can control output effectively; black-box optimization is promising for scalable, safer language model outputs without requiring retraining or gradient access.

Abstract: Large language models can produce toxic or inappropriate text even for benign inputs, creating risks when deployed at scale. Detoxification is therefore important for safety and user trust, particularly when we want to reduce harmful content without sacrificing the model's generation quality. Many existing approaches rely on model retraining, gradients, or learned auxiliary components, which can be costly and may not transfer across model families or to truly black-box settings. We introduce a test-time procedure that approximates the gradient of completion toxicity with respect to the input embeddings and uses a small number of descent steps to steer generation toward less toxic continuations. This is achieved with zeroth-order optimization that requires only access to input embeddings, a toxicity scoring function, and forward evaluations of the model. Empirically, the approach delivers robust toxicity reductions across models and prompts and, in most settings, achieves the best overall toxicity-quality trade-off. More broadly, our work positions word embeddings as effective control variables and encourages wider use of black-box optimization to guide autoregressive language models toward scalable, safer text generation, without requiring any training or access to intermediate computations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ROSA-Tuning, combining an efficient retrieval mechanism with large language models to enhance long-context modeling while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of computational inefficiency and restricted state coverage in existing attention mechanisms for large language models.

Method: The ROSA-Tuning framework features a CPU-based retrieval module to locate relevant historical context positions, a trainable injection mechanism for integrating retrieved information, and improvements like binary discretization and an asynchronous CPU-GPU pipeline.

Result: ROSA-Tuning restores effective long-context handling in windowed attention models, achieving performance near or matching global attention benchmarks, while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: ROSA-Tuning offers an effective and efficient solution for extending large language models' abilities to process long contexts, presenting a practical alternative to global attention methods.

Abstract: Long-context capability and computational efficiency are among the central challenges facing today's large language models. Existing efficient attention methods reduce computational complexity, but they typically suffer from a limited coverage of the model state. This paper proposes ROSA-Tuning, a retrieval-and-recall mechanism for enhancing the long-context modeling ability of pretrained models. Beyond the standard attention mechanism, ROSA-Tuning introduces in parallel a CPU-based ROSA (RWKV Online Suffix Automaton) retrieval module, which efficiently locates historical positions in long contexts that are relevant to the current query, and injects the retrieved information into the model state in a trainable manner; subsequent weighted fusion can then be handled by range-restricted attention. To enable end-to-end training, we design a binary discretization strategy and a counterfactual gradient algorithm, and further optimize overall execution efficiency via an asynchronous CPU-GPU pipeline. Systematic evaluations on Qwen3-Base-1.7B show that ROSA-Tuning substantially restores the long-context modeling ability of windowed-attention models, achieving performance close to and in some cases matching global attention on benchmarks such as LongBench, while maintaining computational efficiency and GPU memory usage that are nearly comparable to windowed-attention methods, offering a new technical path for efficient long-context processing.

*Siyu Li,Chenwei Song,Qi Zhou,Wan Zhou,Xinyi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for integrating domain-specific knowledge graphs with large language models to improve tobacco pest and disease management recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations and limitations in contextual understanding by large language models when generating domain-specific recommendations for tobacco pest and disease management.

Method: The framework integrates structured domain knowledge into LLMs by constructing a domain-specific knowledge graph using GraphRAG. It retrieves query-relevant subgraphs and incorporates graph evidence into answer generation using ChatGLM with LoRA fine-tuning and a graph neural network.

Result: The proposed method improves performance over text-only baselines, with significant enhancement observed in handling multi-hop and comparative reasoning questions.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge graphs into LLMs enhances reasoning and ensures domain-consistent recommendations while mitigating inappropriate conclusions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a graph-augmented reasoning framework for tobacco pest and disease management that integrates structured domain knowledge into large language models. Building on GraphRAG, we construct a domain-specific knowledge graph and retrieve query-relevant subgraphs to provide relational evidence during answer generation. The framework adopts ChatGLM as the Transformer backbone with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and employs a graph neural network to learn node representations that capture symptom-disease-treatment dependencies. By explicitly modeling diseases, symptoms, pesticides, and control measures as linked entities, the system supports evidence-aware retrieval beyond surface-level text similarity. Retrieved graph evidence is incorporated into the LLM input to guide generation toward domain-consistent recommendations and to mitigate hallucinated or inappropriate treatments. Experimental results show consistent improvements over text-only baselines, with the largest gains observed on multi-hop and comparative reasoning questions that require chaining multiple relations.

TL;DR: The study introduces Wide Research, focusing on broad information seeking, and develops WideSeekBench and a novel multi-agent architecture to enhance search capabilities via end-to-end RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks and optimization strategies for broad information seeking under complex constraints.

Method: The authors created WideSeekBench, a benchmark for broad information seeking, and developed WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent system optimized using a unified training framework and end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Result: WideSeek and the multi-agent reinforcement learning framework effectively scale search capabilities, demonstrating promising outcomes with increased agent numbers.

Conclusion: Scaling the number of agents within a dynamic multi-agent architecture represents a beneficial progress in broad information seeking, opening possibilities for the Wide Research paradigm.

Abstract: Search intelligence is evolving from Deep Research to Wide Research, a paradigm essential for retrieving and synthesizing comprehensive information under complex constraints in parallel. However, progress in this field is impeded by the lack of dedicated benchmarks and optimization methodologies for search breadth. To address these challenges, we take a deep dive into Wide Research from two perspectives: Data Pipeline and Agent Optimization. First, we produce WideSeekBench, a General Broad Information Seeking (GBIS) benchmark constructed via a rigorous multi-phase data pipeline to ensure diversity across the target information volume, logical constraints, and domains. Second, we introduce WideSeek, a dynamic hierarchical multi-agent architecture that can autonomously fork parallel sub-agents based on task requirements. Furthermore, we design a unified training framework that linearizes multi-agent trajectories and optimizes the system using end-to-end RL. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WideSeek and multi-agent RL, highlighting that scaling the number of agents is a promising direction for advancing the Wide Research paradigm.

### [78] [Monotonicity as an Architectural Bias for Robust Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02686)
*Patrick Cooper,Alireza Nadali,Ashutosh Trivedi,Alvaro Velasquez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how monotonicity can improve robustness in Transformer-based language models without significantly affecting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models are vulnerable to adversarial prompts and unpredictable changes in outputs due to small structured perturbations in input spaces.

Method: Monotonicity is enforced selectively in feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers, while attention mechanisms remain flexible.

Result: Adversarial attack success rates significantly decrease from 69% to 19%, with only minor degradation in summarization tasks.

Conclusion: Monotonic architectural bias improves robustness without compromising expressivity or performance in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit brittle behavior under adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks, even after extensive alignment and fine-tuning. This fragility reflects a broader challenge of modern neural language models: small, carefully structured perturbations in high-dimensional input spaces can induce large and unpredictable changes in internal semantic representations and output.
  We investigate monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias for improving the robustness of Transformer-based language models. Monotonicity constrains semantic transformations so that strengthening information, evidence, or constraints cannot lead to regressions in the corresponding internal representations. Such order-preserving behavior has long been exploited in control and safety-critical systems to simplify reasoning and improve robustness, but has traditionally been viewed as incompatible with the expressivity required by neural language models.
  We show that this trade-off is not inherent. By enforcing monotonicity selectively in the feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers -- while leaving attention mechanisms unconstrained -- we obtain monotone language models that preserve the performance of their pretrained counterparts. This architectural separation allows negation, contradiction, and contextual interactions to be introduced explicitly through attention, while ensuring that subsequent semantic refinement is order-preserving. Empirically, monotonicity substantially improves robustness: adversarial attack success rates drop from approximately 69% to 19%, while standard summarization performance degrades only marginally.

*Xinyu Wang,Mingze Li,Peng Lu,Xiao-Wen Chang,Lifeng Shang,Jinping Li,Fei Mi,Prasanna Parthasarathi,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfMem improves the ability to reason over ultra-long documents by actively targeting relevant evidence and adapting memory updates, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reasoning over ultra-long documents where evidence may be sparse and distributed across distant segments, requiring improved synthesis and memory strategies.

Method: Proposes InfMem, a System-2-style reasoning framework with a three-step protocol (PreThink-Retrieve-Write), actively monitoring evidence sufficiency, performing selective retrieval, and conducting evidence-aware joint compression.

Result: InfMem demonstrated significant accuracy improvements over MemAgent across different backbone configurations, achieving faster inference through adaptive early stopping.

Conclusion: InfMem offers a reliable solution for ultra-long document reasoning, combining evidence sufficiency monitoring with practical training methods for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning over ultra-long documents requires synthesizing sparse evidence scattered across distant segments under strict memory constraints. While streaming agents enable scalable processing, their passive memory update strategy often fails to preserve low-salience bridging evidence required for multi-hop reasoning. We propose InfMem, a control-centric agent that instantiates System-2-style control via a PreThink-Retrieve-Write protocol. InfMem actively monitors evidence sufficiency, performs targeted in-document retrieval, and applies evidence-aware joint compression to update a bounded memory. To ensure reliable control, we introduce a practical SFT-to-RL training recipe that aligns retrieval, writing, and stopping decisions with end-task correctness. On ultra-long QA benchmarks from 32k to 1M tokens, InfMem consistently outperforms MemAgent across backbones. Specifically, InfMem improves average absolute accuracy by +10.17, +11.84, and +8.23 points on Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen2.5-7B, respectively, while reducing inference time by $3.9\times$ on average (up to $5.1\times$) via adaptive early stopping.

*Rohan Pandey,Haijuan Yan,Hong Yu,Jack Tsai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates risk prediction of homelessness among US veterans using EHR data and machine learning models, demonstrating improvements through socially informed data modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Veteran homelessness is a critical issue in the US, and predicting risk allows for timely intervention to prevent it.

Method: The study analyzed retrospective EHR data of over 4 million VA patients and used various machine learning models, including fine-tuned large language models, to predict future homelessness based on clinician-informed logic and social risks.

Result: Social and behavioral factors improved model performance, with PR-AUC enhancement by 15-30%. Positive predictive values varied from 3.93% to 13.80% across timeframes. Encoder-based models outperformed LLMs in discrimination but with less racial disparity.

Conclusion: Longitudinal EHR modeling integrating social data is effective in stratifying homelessness risk among veterans, enhancing precision for preventive strategies.

Abstract: Homelessness among US veterans remains a critical public health challenge, yet risk prediction offers a pathway for proactive intervention. In this retrospective prognostic study, we analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from 4,276,403 Veterans Affairs patients during a 2016 observation period to predict first-episode homelessness occurring 3-12 months later in 2017 (prevalence: 0.32-1.19%). We constructed static and time-varying EHR representations, utilizing clinician-informed logic to model the persistence of clinical conditions and social risks over time. We then compared the performance of classical machine learning, transformer-based masked language models, and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that incorporating social and behavioral factors into longitudinal models improved precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) by 15-30%. In the top 1% risk tier, models yielded positive predictive values ranging from 3.93-4.72% at 3 months, 7.39-8.30% at 6 months, 9.84-11.41% at 9 months, and 11.65-13.80% at 12 months across model architectures. Large language models underperformed encoder-based models on discrimination but showed smaller performance disparities across racial groups. These results demonstrate that longitudinal, socially informed EHR modeling concentrates homelessness risk into actionable strata, enabling targeted and data-informed prevention strategies for at-risk veterans.

*Elaheh Sabziyan Varnousfaderani,Syed A. M. Shihab,Mohammad Taghizadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses multimodal medical transportation by introducing a greedy heuristic algorithm that integrates ground and air vehicles for timelier, cost-effective dispatching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the efficiency of medical transportation, overcoming delays caused by traffic congestion in ground vehicles and cost/range issues in air vehicles.

Method: A constructive greedy heuristic algorithm was developed, tested across four fleet configurations, to account for factors like traffic, weather, and payload consolidation in vehicle dispatching.

Result: The study evaluated and compared configurations involving ambulances, UAVs, eVTOLs, and fully integrated fleets under identical conditions, assessing efficiency, costs, and transportation times.

Conclusion: A multimodal approach, combining ground and emerging air transportation, outperforms single-mode systems in medical logistics efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Timely transportation of organs, patients, and medical supplies is critical to modern healthcare, particularly in emergencies and transplant scenarios where even short delays can severely impact outcomes. Traditional ground-based vehicles such as ambulances are often hindered by traffic congestion; while air vehicles such as helicopters are faster but costly. Emerging air vehicles -- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft -- have lower operating costs, but remain limited by range and susceptibility to weather conditions. A multimodal transportation system that integrates both air and ground vehicles can leverage the strengths of each to enhance overall transportation efficiency. This study introduces a constructive greedy heuristic algorithm for multimodal vehicle dispatching for medical transportation. Four different fleet configurations were tested: (i) ambulances only, (ii) ambulances with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (iii) ambulances with electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, and (iv) a fully integrated fleet of ambulances, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The algorithm incorporates payload consolidation across compatible routes, accounts for traffic congestion in ground operations and weather conditions in aerial operations, while enabling rapid vehicle dispatching compared to computationally intensive optimization models. Using a common set of conditions, we evaluate all four fleet types to identify the most effective configurations for fulfilling medical transportation needs while minimizing operating costs, recharging/fuel costs, and total transportation time.

### [82] [From Task Solving to Robust Real-World Adaptation in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02760)
*Pouya Pezeshkpour,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) under real-world-like challenges to assess deployment readiness, demonstrating gaps in robustness, and variability in performance under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to stress-test LLM agents under operational circumstances like partial observability and dynamic environments, revealing gaps in their robustness and readiness for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors use a grid-based game to simulate real-world conditions such as noisy signals, environment changes, and incomplete information. They benchmark five state-of-the-art LLMs by their ability to adapt and act effectively under these conditions.

Result: The findings show significant degradation in performance as task complexity increases. Rankings among models vary depending on the uncertainty regime, and agents partially infer their objectives without explicit instruction.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity for advances in verification, safe action selection, and objective inference to improve LLM robustness and adaptability for real-world tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as specialized agents that plan, call tools, and take actions over extended horizons. Yet many existing evaluations assume a "clean interface" where dynamics are specified and stable, tools and sensors are reliable, and success is captured by a single explicit objective-often overestimating real-world readiness. In practice, agents face underspecified rules, unreliable signals, shifting environments, and implicit, multi-stakeholder goals. The challenge is therefore not just solving tasks, but adapting while solving: deciding what to trust, what is wanted, when to verify, and when to fall back or escalate. We stress-test deployment-relevant robustness under four operational circumstances: partial observability, dynamic environments, noisy signals, and dynamic agent state. We benchmark agentic LLMs in a grid-based game with a simple goal but long-horizon execution. Episodes violate clean-interface assumptions yet remain solvable, forcing agents to infer rules, pay for information, adapt to environmental and internal shifts, and act cautiously under noise. Across five state-of-the-art LLM agents, we find large gaps between nominal task-solving and deployment-like robustness. Performance generally degrades as grid size and horizon increase, but rankings are unstable: weaker models can beat stronger ones when strategy matches the uncertainty regime. Despite no explicit instruction, agents trade off completion, efficiency, and penalty avoidance, suggesting partial objective inference. Ablations and feature analyses reveal model-specific sensitivities and failure drivers, motivating work on verification, safe action selection, and objective inference under partial observability, noise, and non-stationarity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, AmharicStoryQA, to evaluate LLMs' understanding of culturally diverse narratives in Ethiopia, exposing significant gaps in narrative comprehension and regional variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of cultural granularity in current language evaluation benchmarks, especially within single languages, which often overlook cultural variations.

Method: They addressed this issue by developing the AmharicStoryQA benchmark focusing on culturally diverse narratives from Amharic-speaking Ethiopian regions.

Result: The study revealed that LLMs struggle with narrative understanding across culturally diverse Amharic-speaking regions and that fine-tuning leads to uneven performance improvements.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of culturally grounded benchmarks to enable accurate evaluation and improvement of narrative understanding in low-resource languages.

Abstract: With the growing emphasis on multilingual and cultural evaluation benchmarks for large language models, language and culture are often treated as synonymous, and performance is commonly used as a proxy for a models understanding of a given language. In this work, we argue that such evaluations overlook meaningful cultural variation that exists within a single language. We address this gap by focusing on narratives from different regions of Ethiopia and demonstrate that, despite shared linguistic characteristics, region-specific and domain-specific content substantially influences language evaluation outcomes. To this end, we introduce \textbf{\textit{AmharicStoryQA}}, a long-sequence story question answering benchmark grounded in culturally diverse narratives from Amharic-speaking regions. Using this benchmark, we reveal a significant narrative understanding gap in existing LLMs, highlight pronounced regional differences in evaluation results, and show that supervised fine-tuning yields uneven improvements across regions and evaluation settings. Our findings emphasize the need for culturally grounded benchmarks that go beyond language-level evaluation to more accurately assess and improve narrative understanding in low-resource languages.

### [84] [When Efficient Communication Explains Convexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02821)
*Ashvin Ranjan,Shane Steinert-Threlkeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of efficient communication in explaining language variation, particularly semantic typology, using the Information Bottleneck approach and the concept of convexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors influencing efficient communication as an explanation for semantic typology across languages and identify the underlying mechanisms.

Method: The study uses the Information Bottleneck framework to analyze semantic communication trade-offs. It identifies a connection between optimality and a novel generalized convexity metric, followed by experiments to determine parameter impacts in the model.

Result: The convexity of the communicative need distribution significantly correlates with linguistic optimality. Various modeling parameters were manipulated, highlighting convexity as a key factor.

Conclusion: Efficient communication influences semantic typology, driven by communicative need distributions' convexity. This identifies why efficient communication explains language patterns, advancing the field in understanding language structure.

Abstract: Much recent work has argued that the variation in the languages of the world can be explained from the perspective of efficient communication; in particular, languages can be seen as optimally balancing competing pressures to be simple and to be informative. Focusing on the expression of meaning -- semantic typology -- the present paper asks what factors are responsible for successful explanations in terms of efficient communication. Using the Information Bottleneck (IB) approach to formalizing this trade-off, we first demonstrate and analyze a correlation between optimality in the IB sense and a novel generalization of convexity to this setting. In a second experiment, we manipulate various modeling parameters in the IB framework to determine which factors drive the correlation between convexity and optimality. We find that the convexity of the communicative need distribution plays an especially important role. These results move beyond showing that efficient communication can explain aspects of semantic typology into explanations for why that is the case by identifying which underlying factors are responsible.

*Jiaqi Xue,Qian Lou,Jiarong Xing,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2-Router revolutionizes LLM routing by optimizing both LLM selection and output length budgets, significantly reducing costs while maintaining high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routers fail to consider that an LLM's quality can vary with output length, resulting in missed opportunities to save costs by using powerful LLMs efficiently for shorter outputs.

Method: R2-Router jointly optimizes LLM selection and controllable output length budgets, enforcing limitations through length-constrained instructions. A new dataset, R2-Bench, was also introduced to evaluate this approach.

Result: R2-Router achieves state-of-the-art performance at 4-5x lower cost compared to prior LLM routers, demonstrating the feasibility of cost-effective routing with controlled output lengths.

Conclusion: R2-Router introduces the concept of routing as reasoning, transforming routers into intelligent selectors that balance LLM choice and cost constraints, opening a new direction for LLM applications.

Abstract: As LLMs proliferate with diverse capabilities and costs, LLM routing has emerged by learning to predict each LLM's quality and cost for a given query, then selecting the one with high quality and low cost. However, existing routers implicitly assume a single fixed quality and cost per LLM for each query, ignoring that the same LLM's quality varies with its output length. This causes routers to exclude powerful LLMs when their estimated cost exceeds the budget, missing the opportunity that these LLMs could still deliver high quality at reduced cost with shorter outputs. To address this, we introduce R2-Router, which treats output length budget as a controllable variable and jointly selects the best LLM and length budget, enforcing the budget via length-constrained instructions. This enables R2-Router to discover that a powerful LLM with constrained output can outperform a weaker LLM at comparable cost-efficient configurations invisible to prior methods. Together with the router framework, we construct R2-Bench, the first routing dataset capturing LLM behavior across diverse output length budgets. Experiments show that R2-Router achieves state-of-the-art performance at 4-5x lower cost compared with existing routers. This work opens a new direction: routing as reasoning, where routers evolve from reactive selectors to deliberate reasoners that explore which LLM to use and at what cost budget.

*Zhengbang Yang,Yisheng Zhong,Junyuan Hong,Zhuangdi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CATNIP method to address limitations in unlearning knowledge in LLMs with fine-grained control, avoiding reliance on retention data or contrastive pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to effectively and selectively unlearn undesirable knowledge in LLMs without degrading general knowledge or relying on impractical data, addressing safety and privacy concerns.

Method: The proposed method, CATNIP, uses Calibrated and Tokenized Negative Preference Alignment to rescale unlearning effects proportional to the model's token-level confidence, ensuring precise and robust knowledge forgetting.

Result: Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets (MUSE and WMDP) demonstrate that CATNIP achieves stronger tradeoffs between knowledge forgetting and preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods, without requiring additional data.

Conclusion: CATNIP is an effective and practical solution for LLM unlearning that overcomes previous limitations, offering precise control over forgetting and better robustness to data variability.

Abstract: Pretrained knowledge memorized in LLMs raises critical concerns over safety and privacy, which has motivated LLM Unlearning as a technique for selectively removing the influences of undesirable knowledge. Existing approaches, rooted in Gradient Ascent (GA), often degrade general domain knowledge while relying on retention data or curated contrastive pairs, which can be either impractical or data and computationally prohibitive. Negative Preference Alignment has been explored for unlearning to tackle the limitations of GA, which, however, remains confined by its choice of reference model and shows undermined performance in realistic data settings. These limitations raise two key questions: i) Can we achieve effective unlearning that quantifies model confidence in undesirable knowledge and uses it to calibrate gradient updates more precisely, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting? ii) Can we make unlearning robust to data scarcity and length variation? We answer both questions affirmatively with CATNIP (Calibrated and Tokenized Negative Preference Alignment), a principled method that rescales unlearning effects in proportion to the model's token-level confidence, thus ensuring fine-grained control over forgetting. Extensive evaluations on MUSE and WMDP benchmarks demonstrated that our work enables effective unlearning without requiring retention data or contrastive unlearning response pairs, with stronger knowledge forgetting and preservation tradeoffs than state-of-the-art methods.

*Polina Tsvilodub,Karl Mulligan,Todd Snider,Robert D. Hawkins,Michael Franke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper models how humans decide to ask clarification questions (CQs) by analyzing both uncertainty and potential costs associated with acting without asking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how humans make decisions in uncertain situations and why they sometimes choose to ask for clarification instead of acting directly.

Method: A computational model based on expected regret was created to predict when clarification questions would be asked. The predictions were tested with experiments examining both linguistic responses and broader actions.

Result: The experiments supported the hypothesis, showing that people ask clarification questions proportionally to the risks of making costly mistakes under uncertainty.

Conclusion: Humans make rational decisions to balance the cost of asking clarification questions against the potential losses of acting without reducing uncertainty.

Abstract: When deciding how to act under uncertainty, agents may choose to act to reduce uncertainty or they may act despite that uncertainty.In communicative settings, an important way of reducing uncertainty is by asking clarification questions (CQs). We predict that the decision to ask a CQ depends on both contextual uncertainty and the cost of alternative actions, and that these factors interact: uncertainty should matter most when acting incorrectly is costly. We formalize this interaction in a computational model based on expected regret: how much an agent stands to lose by acting now rather than with full information. We test these predictions in two experiments, one examining purely linguistic responses to questions and another extending to choices between clarification and non-linguistic action. Taken together, our results suggest a rational tradeoff: humans tend to seek clarification proportional to the risk of substantial loss when acting under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integration of discourse processing with natural language generation in existing undergraduate NLP curricula, especially amidst the evolving landscape of NLP.

Method: The authors collaboratively designed and implemented a new cross-listed course focusing on computational discourse and natural language generation. The course integrates theoretical and empirical elements and emphasizes exploratory learning.

Result: The course was introduced in the Fall of 2025, with an independent survey highlighting the course's impact and potential for further improvement.

Conclusion: The course fosters an interdisciplinary understanding of discourse processing and natural language generation. Insights from the course implementation pave the way for future curricular enhancements and research directions.

Abstract: The field of NLP has undergone vast, continuous transformations over the past few years, sparking debates going beyond discipline boundaries. This begs important questions in education: how do we design courses that bridge sub-disciplines in this shifting landscape? This paper explores this question from the angle of discourse processing, an area with rich linguistic insights and computational models for the intentional, attentional, and coherence structure of language. Discourse is highly relevant for open-ended or long-form text generation, yet this connection is under-explored in existing undergraduate curricula. We present a new course, "Computational Discourse and Natural Language Generation". The course is collaboratively designed by a team with complementary expertise and was offered for the first time in Fall 2025 as an upper-level undergraduate course, cross-listed between Linguistics and Computer Science. Our philosophy is to deeply integrate the theoretical and empirical aspects, and create an exploratory mindset inside the classroom and in the assignments. This paper describes the course in detail and concludes with takeaways from an independent survey as well as our vision for future directions.

*Ahmad Shapiro,Karan Taneja,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALT, a lightweight hallucination detector using token log-probabilities as time series, provides efficient and domain-generalized hallucination detection for LLMs. It introduces strong performance benchmarks via the HUB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their reliability, particularly in safety-critical tasks, necessitating an accurate, efficient approach to identify and address these issues effectively.

Method: HALT utilizes a gated recurrent unit model with entropy-based features to assess hallucinations by analyzing LLM generations' output token log-probabilities as a time series, offering a lightweight yet effective alternative compared to larger encoders.

Result: HALT surpasses Lettuce in hallucination detection by being 30 times smaller and achieving a 60x speed gain when benchmarked on HUB, a consolidated dataset covering diverse reasoning and general skills.

Conclusion: HALT demonstrates efficiency, generalization, and strong performance in detecting hallucinations across various tasks, proving its utility as a reliable tool for improving LLM outputs, especially in proprietary or resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a major obstacle for large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains. We present HALT (Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series), a lightweight hallucination detector that leverages only the top-20 token log-probabilities from LLM generations as a time series. HALT uses a gated recurrent unit model combined with entropy-based features to learn model calibration bias, providing an extremely efficient alternative to large encoders. Unlike white-box approaches, HALT does not require access to hidden states or attention maps, relying only on output log-probabilities. Unlike black-box approaches, it operates on log-probs rather than surface-form text, which enables stronger domain generalization and compatibility with proprietary LLMs without requiring access to internal weights. To benchmark performance, we introduce HUB (Hallucination detection Unified Benchmark), which consolidates prior datasets into ten capabilities covering both reasoning tasks (Algorithmic, Commonsense, Mathematical, Symbolic, Code Generation) and general purpose skills (Chat, Data-to-Text, Question Answering, Summarization, World Knowledge). While being 30x smaller, HALT outperforms Lettuce, a fine-tuned modernBERT-base encoder, achieving a 60x speedup gain on HUB. HALT and HUB together establish an effective framework for hallucination detection across diverse LLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses fairness in LLMs beyond access-level behaviors by examining differences in interaction quality across demographics. It evaluates GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B in career advice tasks and finds disparities in linguistic interaction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite equitable access guarantees in LLMs, differences in the quality of interactions across demographic identities remain a concern, necessitating fairness evaluation at interaction levels.

Method: Using counterfactual prompts, the study evaluates GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on linguistic metrics like sentiment, politeness, and hedging, analyzing identity-conditioned variations in interaction quality.

Result: Both models show zero refusal rates, ensuring equitable access. However, disparities in interaction quality were noted: GPT-4 hedges more with younger male users, while LLaMA shows broad sentiment variation across identities.

Conclusion: Equal access does not ensure fair interaction quality, highlighting the need for audits beyond refusal-based fairness metrics to address persistent inequities in model interactions.

Abstract: Prior work on fairness in large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on access-level behaviors such as refusals and safety filtering. However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits.

*Mitchell Abrams,Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab,Felix Gervits,Vasanth Sarathy,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SNIC, a testbed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to reason over social norms for embodied agents, revealing their limitations in norm-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need to navigate complex social environments where interaction relies on reasoning over implicit and explicit social norms.

Method: The authors developed SNIC, a diagnostic testbed emphasizing norm-based reference resolution (NBRR) in tasks like cleaning and serving, with evaluations on LLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle to consistently identify, infer, and apply social norms, especially when they are implicit or conflicting.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face challenges in reasoning about social norms, which poses a limitation for their use in socially situated and embodied contexts.

Abstract: Embodied agents, such as robots, will need to interact in situated environments where successful communication often depends on reasoning over social norms: shared expectations that constrain what actions are appropriate in context. A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPMöbius, a data-free reinforcement learning method aimed at improving reasoning capabilities of models by employing a collaborative Coach-Player paradigm rather than heavy reliance on supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approaches, which require large-scale human-curated tasks and show diminishing returns in scalability.

Method: The proposed CPMöbius replaces adversarial self-play with a cooperative setup where the Coach assigns tasks and rewards are based on mutual improvement between the Coach and Player roles.

Result: CPMöbius significantly improves mathematical reasoning performance without any external training data, outperforming other unsupervised methods with accuracy gains of +4.9 overall and +5.4 in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: CPMöbius demonstrates the potential of data-free reinforcement learning combined with collaborative structures, suggesting a sustainable direction for advancing reasoning models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in complex reasoning, yet their progress remains fundamentally constrained by reliance on massive high-quality human-curated tasks and labels, either through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data. This dependence renders supervision-heavy training paradigms increasingly unsustainable, with signs of diminishing scalability already evident in practice. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CPMöbius (CPMobius), a collaborative Coach-Player paradigm for data-free reinforcement learning of reasoning models. Unlike traditional adversarial self-play, CPMöbius, inspired by real world human sports collaboration and multi-agent collaboration, treats the Coach and Player as independent but cooperative roles. The Coach proposes instructions targeted at the Player's capability and receives rewards based on changes in the Player's performance, while the Player is rewarded for solving the increasingly instructive tasks generated by the Coach. This cooperative optimization loop is designed to directly enhance the Player's mathematical reasoning ability. Remarkably, CPMöbius achieves substantial improvement without relying on any external training data, outperforming existing unsupervised approaches. For example, on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, our method improves accuracy by an overall average of +4.9 and an out-of-distribution average of +5.4, exceeding RENT by +1.5 on overall accuracy and R-zero by +4.2 on OOD accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'LatentMem,' a new memory framework for multi-agent systems to address challenges of memory homogenization and information overload, significantly improving collective intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems face challenges like lack of role-specific memory customization and inefficiency from overly detailed memory storage.

Method: Introduces a 'LatentMem' framework consisting of an experience bank and a memory composer, along with Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO) to create compact, high-utility memory representations.

Result: LatentMem achieves up to 19.36% performance improvement over standard settings and consistently outperforms other architectures across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: LatentMem effectively customizes memory for large multi-agent systems, improving efficiency and performance without altering underlying frameworks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to $19.36$% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks.

*Xing Hu,Dawei Yang,Yuan Cheng,Zhixuan Chen,Zukang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAES-SVD, a low-rank compression framework for large language models (LLMs), designed to address error propagation and accumulation during compression processes, resulting in improved performance post-compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently compressing large language models is increasingly necessary due to their rapid growth in parameter scale, but current methods overlook error accumulation across layers, causing suboptimal outcomes.

Method: The paper proposes Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), which incorporates two components: CEALC (targeting cumulative error compensation with closed-form solutions) and ACES (adjusting weighting coefficients to optimize low-rank structure utilization).

Result: Experiments show that SAES-SVD enhances post-compression performance across various LLM architectures and tasks without requiring fine-tuning or mixed-rank strategies.

Conclusion: SAES-SVD effectively mitigates propagated errors within LLM compression processes, demonstrating high compatibility and improved efficiency across diverse models.

Abstract: The rapid growth in the parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has created a high demand for efficient compression techniques. As a hardware-agnostic and highly compatible technique, low-rank compression has been widely adopted. However, existing methods typically compress each layer independently by minimizing per-layer reconstruction error, overlooking a critical limitation: the reconstruction error propagates and accumulates through the network, which leads to amplified global deviations from the full-precision baseline. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), a LLMs compression framework that jointly optimizes intra-layer reconstruction and inter-layer error compensation. SAES-SVD is composed of two novel components: (1) Cumulative Error-Aware Layer Compression (CEALC), which formulates the compression objective as a combination of local reconstruction and weighted cumulative error compensation. Based on it, we derive a closed-form low-rank solution relied on second-order activation statistics, which explicitly aligns each layer's output with its full-precision counterpart to compensate for accumulated errors. (2) Adaptive Collaborative Error Suppression (ACES), which automatically adjusts the weighting coefficient to enhance the low-rank structure of the compression objective in CEALC. Specifically, the coefficient is optimized to maximize the ratio between the Frobenius norm of the compressed layer's output and that of the compression objective under a fixed rank, thus ensuring that the rank budget is utilized effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures and tasks show that, without fine-tuning or mixed-rank strategies, SAES-SVD consistently improves post-compression performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReMiT, a novel method for improving large language models (LLMs) by creating a feedback loop that enhances their capabilities during the mid-training phase, resulting in better reasoning and sustained improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and establish the potential of a bidirectional training process that retroactively strengthens the pre-trained foundation of LLMs, aiming for continuous, self-reinforcing improvement.

Method: The authors analyze training dynamics and identify the annealing phase as critical. They propose ReMiT, which uses reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model's reasoning strengths to reweight tokens dynamically during the mid-training phase, especially prioritizing reasoning-critical tokens.

Result: ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3% on 10 pre-training benchmarks in areas like math, code, and reasoning. These benefits are sustained with over 2% gains in the subsequent post-training pipeline.

Conclusion: The iterative feedback approach, enabled through ReMiT, proves that LLMs can evolve continuously and self-reinforce, unlocking a new paradigm in the training of LLMs.

Abstract: Standard training pipelines for large language models (LLMs) are typically unidirectional, progressing from pre-training to post-training. However, the potential for a bidirectional process--where insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundation--remains unexplored. We aim to establish a self-reinforcing flywheel: a cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as a critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under a rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement Learning-Guided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3\% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2\% throughout the post-training pipeline. These results validate an iterative feedback loop, enabling continuous and self-reinforcing evolution of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper presents AERO, an unsupervised framework for improving reasoning in Large Language Models through autonomous questioning, answering, and criticism. It demonstrates significant performance enhancements across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of LLMs, such as dependency on expert data, external verifiers, and risks of self-reinforcing incorrect reasoning during self-evolution processes.

Method: AERO employs a dual-loop system inspired by Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) for self-evolution. It includes entropy-based positioning, Independent Counterfactual Correction for verification, and a Staggered Training Strategy to maintain capability growth.

Result: Evaluations over nine benchmarks demonstrated average performance gains of 4.57% on Qwen3-4B-Base and 5.10% on Qwen3-8B-Base, surpassing leading alternatives.

Conclusion: AERO effectively mitigates LLMs' reasoning bottlenecks by integrating autonomous learning mechanisms, leading to measurable improvements in performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in complex reasoning but remain bottlenecked by reliance on expert-annotated data and external verifiers. While existing self-evolution paradigms aim to bypass these constraints, they often fail to identify the optimal learning zone and risk reinforcing collective hallucinations and incorrect priors through flawed internal feedback. To address these challenges, we propose \underline{A}utonomous \underline{E}volutionary \underline{R}easoning \underline{O}ptimization (AERO), an unsupervised framework that achieves autonomous reasoning evolution by internalizing self-questioning, answering, and criticism within a synergistic dual-loop system. Inspired by the \textit{Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)} theory, AERO utilizes entropy-based positioning to target the ``solvability gap'' and employs Independent Counterfactual Correction for robust verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Staggered Training Strategy to synchronize capability growth across functional roles and prevent curriculum collapse. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmarks spanning three domains demonstrate that AERO achieves average performance improvements of 4.57\% on Qwen3-4B-Base and 5.10\% on Qwen3-8B-Base, outperforming competitive baselines.

Motivation: Investigating whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve their reasoning capabilities without additional training and external supervision.

Method: Proposes Test-time Recursive Thinking (TRT), an iterative self-improvement framework that uses rollout-specific strategies, accumulated knowledge, and self-generated verification signals during generation.

Result: Using TRT, open-source models achieve 100% accuracy on AIME-25/24, and closed-source models improve on LiveCodeBench by 10.4-14.8 percentage points on challenging problems.

Conclusion: Iterative self-improvement mechanisms like TRT can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities significantly without requiring additional ground-truth supervision or external feedback.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvements in reasoning capabilities, driven largely by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. Here, we ask whether these LLMs can self-improve without the need for additional training. We identify two core challenges for such systems: (i) efficiently generating diverse, high-quality candidate solutions, and (ii) reliably selecting correct answers in the absence of ground-truth supervision. To address these challenges, we propose Test-time Recursive Thinking (TRT), an iterative self-improvement framework that conditions generation on rollout-specific strategies, accumulated knowledge, and self-generated verification signals. Using TRT, open-source models reach 100% accuracy on AIME-25/24, and on LiveCodeBench's most difficult problems, closed-source models improve by 10.4-14.8 percentage points without external feedback.

*Pritam Kadasi,Abhishek Upperwal,Mayank Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Task-Specificity Score (TSS), which evaluates if instructions uniquely determine outputs in training language models, and demonstrates its application across datasets and language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate whether instructions for training language models uniquely determine the output, as weakly specified instruction-output mappings can affect model performance.

Method: The authors propose the Task-Specificity Score (TSS) and its extension TSS++, which assess the impact of specific instructions on predictions by comparing true instructions with alternatives and mitigating easy-negative effects.

Result: The study applies TSS and TSS++ to datasets (Alpaca, Dolly-15k, NI-20) and models (Gemma, Llama, Qwen), showing improved downstream performance and complementing quality filters under token constraints.

Conclusion: Quantifying task-specificity aids in filtering and selecting training examples that improve the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned language models.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is now the default way to train and adapt large language models, but many instruction--input--output pairs are only weakly specified: for a given input, the same output can remain plausible under several alternative instructions. This raises a simple question: \emph{does the instruction uniquely determine the target output?}
  We propose the \textbf{Task--Specificity Score (TSS)} to quantify how much an instruction matters for predicting its output, by contrasting the true instruction against plausible alternatives for the same input. We further introduce \textbf{TSS++}, which uses hard alternatives and a small quality term to mitigate easy-negative effects. Across three instruction datasets (\textsc{Alpaca}, \textsc{Dolly-15k}, \textsc{NI-20}) and three open LLMs (Gemma, Llama, Qwen), we show that selecting task-specific examples improves downstream performance under tight token budgets and complements quality-based filters such as perplexity and IFD.

Abstract: From a pragmatic perspective, this study systematically evaluates the differences in performance among representative large language models (LLMs) in recognizing politeness, impoliteness, and mock politeness phenomena in Chinese. Addressing the existing gaps in pragmatic comprehension, the research adopts the frameworks of Rapport Management Theory and the Model of Mock Politeness to construct a three-category dataset combining authentic and simulated Chinese discourse. Six representative models, including GPT-5.1 and DeepSeek, were selected as test subjects and evaluated under four prompting conditions: zero-shot, few-shot, knowledge-enhanced, and hybrid strategies. This study serves as a meaningful attempt within the paradigm of ``Great Linguistics,'' offering a novel approach to applying pragmatic theory in the age of technological transformation. It also responds to the contemporary question of how technology and the humanities may coexist, representing an interdisciplinary endeavor that bridges linguistic technology and humanistic reflection.

Method: ChemPro divides 4100 questions into sections based on difficulty levels, spanning various chemistry domains, and evaluates 52 LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform well on basic questions, but struggle with complex ones, revealing limitations in scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: ChemPro highlights LLM weaknesses in handling complex scientific challenges, necessitating improved methodologies for LLM development.

Abstract: We introduce ChemPro, a progressive benchmark with 4100 natural language question-answer pairs in Chemistry, across 4 coherent sections of difficulty designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a broad spectrum of general chemistry topics. We include Multiple Choice Questions and Numerical Questions spread across fine-grained information recall, long-horizon reasoning, multi-concept questions, problem-solving with nuanced articulation, and straightforward questions in a balanced ratio, effectively covering Bio-Chemistry, Inorganic-Chemistry, Organic-Chemistry and Physical-Chemistry. ChemPro is carefully designed analogous to a student's academic evaluation for basic to high-school chemistry. A gradual increase in the question difficulty rigorously tests the ability of LLMs to progress from solving basic problems to solving more sophisticated challenges.
  We evaluate 45+7 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and proprietary variants, and our analysis reveals that while LLMs perform well on basic chemistry questions, their accuracy declines with different types and levels of complexity. These findings highlight the critical limitations of LLMs in general scientific reasoning and understanding and point towards understudied dimensions of difficulty, emphasizing the need for more robust methodologies to improve LLMs.

Motivation: To create AI capable of long-term, complex social interactions by addressing the limitations of static, single-turn optimization frameworks.

Method: OMAR trains a single model to role-play multiple participants in dynamic interactions using hierarchical advantage estimation for training stability during long dialogues.

Result: OMAR shows emergent social intelligence like empathy and persuasion, validated through SOTOPIA and Werewolf strategy game environments.

Conclusion: OMAR demonstrates AI's potential to develop rich social intelligence via self-play, encouraging further exploration of group conversational intelligence frameworks.

Abstract: This paper introduces OMAR: One Model, All Roles, a reinforcement learning framework that enables AI to develop social intelligence through multi-turn, multi-agent conversational self-play. Unlike traditional paradigms that rely on static, single-turn optimizations, OMAR allows a single model to role-play all participants in a conversation simultaneously, learning to achieve long-term goals and complex social norms directly from dynamic social interaction. To ensure training stability across long dialogues, we implement a hierarchical advantage estimation that calculates turn-level and token-level advantages. Evaluations in the SOTOPIA social environment and Werewolf strategy games show that our trained models develop fine-grained, emergent social intelligence, such as empathy, persuasion, and compromise seeking, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning collaboration even under competitive scenarios. While we identify practical challenges like reward hacking, our results show that rich social intelligence can emerge without human supervision. We hope this work incentivizes further research on AI social intelligence in group conversations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models face challenges of latency and computational cost due to the generation of verbose reasoning chains, prompting the need for optimization in reasoning efficiency.

Method: CoSMo uses a split-merge algorithm to refine reasoning chains and employs structure-aligned reinforcement learning with a segment-level budget to optimize reasoning structure.

Result: CoSMo improves accuracy by 3.3 points and reduces segment usage by 28.7% on average across multiple benchmarks, outperforming reasoning efficiency baselines.

Conclusion: CoSMo enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning in large models by eliminating redundancies while maintaining accuracy, making it a pivotal advancement in efficient model reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks through the generation of long reasoning chains, this reliance on verbose generation results in significant latency and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CoSMo} (\textbf{Co}nsistency-Guided \textbf{S}plit-\textbf{M}erge \textbf{O}ptimization), a framework designed to eliminate structural redundancy rather than indiscriminately restricting token volume. Specifically, CoSMo utilizes a split-merge algorithm that dynamically refines reasoning chains by merging redundant segments and splitting logical gaps to ensure coherence. We then employ structure-aligned reinforcement learning with a novel segment-level budget to supervise the model in maintaining efficient reasoning structures throughout training. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoSMo achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by \textbf{3.3} points while reducing segment usage by \textbf{28.7\%} on average compared to reasoning efficiency baselines.

TL;DR: FASA introduces a new method to handle large language models' memory issues by efficiently pruning irrelevant tokens using query-aware techniques, showing superior performance in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling lengthy inputs in large language models faces challenges due to the high memory requirements of Key Value (KV) caches, especially during lengthy text processing.

Method: The authors propose FASA, a framework leveraging functional sparsity in frequency-chunk (FC) levels for query-aware token pruning. FASA identifies important tokens using dominant FCs and restricts focus to them, significantly reducing memory and computational costs.

Result: FASA shows robust performance on multiple long-context tasks, such as sequence modeling and reasoning, consistently outperforming others. In tests like LongBench-V1 and AIME24, it maintains near-original accuracy while drastically reducing resources.

Conclusion: FASA's query-aware token pruning offers an efficient solution to reduce the memory bottleneck in large language models, proving its effectiveness in improving computational efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical bottleneck when handling lengthy inputs: the prohibitive memory footprint of the Key Value (KV) cache. To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of "dominant" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets. Notably, on LongBench-V1, FASA reaches nearly 100\% of full-KV performance when only keeping 256 tokens, and achieves 2.56$\times$ speedup using just 18.9\% of the cache on AIME24.

Motivation: The research aims to address the scarcity of privacy-sensitive data that limits advancements in AI and poses challenges in handling sensitive personal information, especially with modern AI agents.

Method: The authors created Privasis, a synthetic dataset with 1.4 million records and 55.1 million annotated attributes. They used this dataset for developing text sanitization pipelines and compact models to ensure privacy protection.

Result: The developed sanitization models, trained on Privasis, outperform state-of-the-art large language models like GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B in privacy-related tasks, showcasing the practical applicability of the dataset.

Conclusion: Privasis provides an unprecedented resource for privacy-oriented research, enhancing the quality and scale of sensitive data studies. The release of this dataset, along with models and codes, aims to accelerate advancements in AI handling privacy-sensitive data.

Abstract: Research involving privacy-sensitive data has always been constrained by data scarcity, standing in sharp contrast to other areas that have benefited from data scaling. This challenge is becoming increasingly urgent as modern AI agents--such as OpenClaw and Gemini Agent--are granted persistent access to highly sensitive personal information. To tackle this longstanding bottleneck and the rising risks, we present Privasis (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale fully synthetic dataset entirely built from scratch--an expansive reservoir of texts with rich and diverse private information--designed to broaden and accelerate research in areas where processing sensitive social data is inevitable. Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (<=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B. We plan to release data, models, and code to accelerate future research on privacy-sensitive domains and agents.

Motivation: Large language models face efficiency challenges due to the linear growth of memory and computation costs caused by long reasoning traces. Traditional cache eviction methods struggle to address complex dependencies, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The proposed framework, ForesightKV, uses supervised learning (Golden Eviction algorithm and Pairwise Ranking Loss) and reinforcement learning (Markov Decision Process and GRPO algorithm) to predict optimal KV cache eviction during long-text generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ForesightKV consistently achieves better efficiency and performance compared to prior methods, even with reduced cache budgets.

Conclusion: ForesightKV offers a synergistic solution by combining supervised and reinforcement learning approaches to optimize cache eviction, improving efficiency without compromising reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning abilities by producing long reasoning traces. However, as the sequence length grows, the key-value (KV) cache expands linearly, incurring significant memory and computation costs. Existing KV cache eviction methods mitigate this issue by discarding less important KV pairs, but often fail to capture complex KV dependencies, resulting in performance degradation. To better balance efficiency and performance, we introduce ForesightKV, a training-based KV cache eviction framework that learns to predict which KV pairs to evict during long-text generations. We first design the Golden Eviction algorithm, which identifies the optimal eviction KV pairs at each step using future attention scores. These traces and the scores at each step are then distilled via supervised training with a Pairwise Ranking Loss. Furthermore, we formulate cache eviction as a Markov Decision Process and apply the GRPO algorithm to mitigate the significant language modeling loss increase on low-entropy tokens. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025 benchmarks of three reasoning models demonstrate that ForesightKV consistently outperforms prior methods under only half the cache budget, while benefiting synergistically from both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches.

### [106] [Token Sparse Attention: Efficient Long-Context Inference with Interleaved Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03216)
*Dongwon Jo,Beomseok Kang,Jiwon Song,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Token Sparse Attention, a dynamic sparsification method improving the efficiency of attention mechanisms in large language models with long contexts, achieving significant speedup and minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity of attention and introduce a more dynamic and flexible approach to sparsify attention layers while overcoming limitations of static and irreversible token-ejection strategies.

Method: Token Sparse Attention dynamically compresses $Q$, $K$, $V$ tokens during the attention process and decompresses them back after processing. It integrates seamlessly with existing dense and sparse attention implementations, while reconsidering token importance layer-wise.

Result: The method achieves up to a 3.23x speedup in attention computation for contexts of up to 128K tokens, with less than 1% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Token Sparse Attention demonstrates that dynamic token sparsification effectively balances accuracy and computational efficiency, serving as a scalable and complementary solution for long-context inference in language models.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention remains the central bottleneck in long-context inference for large language models. Prior acceleration methods either sparsify the attention map with structured patterns or permanently evict tokens at specific layers, which can retain irrelevant tokens or rely on irreversible early decisions despite the layer-/head-wise dynamics of token importance. In this paper, we propose Token Sparse Attention, a lightweight and dynamic token-level sparsification mechanism that compresses per-head $Q$, $K$, $V$ to a reduced token set during attention and then decompresses the output back to the original sequence, enabling token information to be reconsidered in subsequent layers. Furthermore, Token Sparse Attention exposes a new design point at the intersection of token selection and sparse attention. Our approach is fully compatible with dense attention implementations, including Flash Attention, and can be seamlessly composed with existing sparse attention kernels. Experimental results show that Token Sparse Attention consistently improves accuracy-latency trade-off, achieving up to $\times$3.23 attention speedup at 128K context with less than 1% accuracy degradation. These results demonstrate that dynamic and interleaved token-level sparsification is a complementary and effective strategy for scalable long-context inference.

*Xuancheng Li,Haitao Li,Yujia Zhou,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paper proposes ATACompressor for addressing 'lost in the middle' issue in LLMs by dynamically compressing task-relevant portions of long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context compression methods fail to preserve essential information while achieving efficient compression, leading to performance issues in long-context LLM tasks.

Method: ATACompressor selectively encodes task-relevant context and uses adaptive allocation to adjust compression rates dynamically, enhancing task-specific processing.

Result: ATACompressor surpasses traditional methods in compression efficiency and task performance, demonstrated on QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, SQUAD.

Conclusion: ATACompressor offers a scalable and effective solution for long-context challenges in LLMs, confirming its utility through ablation and analysis experiments.

Abstract: Long-context inputs in large language models (LLMs) often suffer from the "lost in the middle" problem, where critical information becomes diluted or ignored due to excessive length. Context compression methods aim to address this by reducing input size, but existing approaches struggle with balancing information preservation and compression efficiency. We propose Adaptive Task-Aware Compressor (ATACompressor), which dynamically adjusts compression based on the specific requirements of the task. ATACompressor employs a selective encoder that compresses only the task-relevant portions of long contexts, ensuring that essential information is preserved while reducing unnecessary content. Its adaptive allocation controller perceives the length of relevant content and adjusts the compression rate accordingly, optimizing resource utilization. We evaluate ATACompressor on three QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, and SQUAD-showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both compression efficiency and task performance. Our approach provides a scalable solution for long-context processing in LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a range of ablation studies and analysis experiments to gain deeper insights into the key components of ATACompressor.

*Junhui He,Zhihui Fu,Jun Wang,Qingan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Structured pruning is improved by introducing POP, focusing on stage-aware inference to reduce computational costs without heavily compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high computational costs associated with deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Method: The authors propose a stage-aware inference strategy called Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), which omits deep layers during the prefill stage while maintaining them in the decode stage, supported by virtual gate importance analysis, KV projections, and boundary handling strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate up to 1.37× speedup in prefill latency across Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3, with minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: POP effectively balances the trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy, overcoming limitations of existing pruning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, their deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods.

*Yifan Shi,Jialong Shi,Jiayi Wang,Ye Fan,Jianyong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRROR, an end-to-end framework that improves the translation of natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing approaches that depend on costly post-training or lack effective error correction and task-specific retrieval when translating natural language problems into optimization models.

Method: MIRROR employs two mechanisms: (1) an iterative error correction method based on execution-driven adaptive revisions, and (2) hierarchical retrieval for sourcing relevant examples from a curated library.

Result: MIRROR demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods on standard benchmarks as well as complex industrial datasets like IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP.

Conclusion: MIRROR is an efficient and fine-tuning-free OR modeling solution, particularly beneficial for non-expert users, as it effectively integrates external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction.

Abstract: Operations Research (OR) relies on expert-driven modeling-a slow and fragile process ill-suited to novel scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) can automatically translate natural language into optimization models, existing approaches either rely on costly post-training or employ multi-agent frameworks, yet most still lack reliable collaborative error correction and task-specific retrieval, often leading to incorrect outputs. We propose MIRROR, a fine-tuning-free, end-to-end multi-agent framework that directly translates natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code. MIRROR integrates two core mechanisms: (1) execution-driven iterative adaptive revision for automatic error correction, and (2) hierarchical retrieval to fetch relevant modeling and coding exemplars from a carefully curated exemplar library. Experiments show that MIRROR outperforms existing methods on standard OR benchmarks, with notable results on complex industrial datasets such as IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP. By combining precise external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction, MIRROR provides non-expert users with an efficient and reliable OR modeling solution, overcoming the fundamental limitations of general-purpose LLMs in expert optimization tasks.

TL;DR: A study explores the inconsistent effects of interventions by LLM critic models, revealing potential performance degradation despite high critic accuracy, and proposes a pre-deployment test to prevent regressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of proactive interventions by binary LLM critic models, especially given the lack of understanding of their deployment effects.

Method: A disruption-recovery tradeoff is identified, and a pre-deployment test using 50 task pilots is proposed to estimate whether intervention will help or harm without full deployment.

Result: The proposed test anticipates outcomes correctly across benchmarks: intervention worsens high-success tasks (-26 pp) but offers modest improvements for high-failure benchmarks (+2.8 pp on ALFWorld).

Conclusion: Critic model accuracy alone cannot ensure safe intervention. The pre-deployment framework helps discern when to intervene and when not, thereby avoiding serious performance regressions.

Abstract: Proactive interventions by LLM critic models are often assumed to improve reliability, yet their effects at deployment time are poorly understood. We show that a binary LLM critic with strong offline accuracy (AUROC 0.94) can nevertheless cause severe performance degradation, inducing a 26 percentage point (pp) collapse on one model while affecting another by near zero pp. This variability demonstrates that LLM critic accuracy alone is insufficient to determine whether intervention is safe.
  We identify a disruption-recovery tradeoff: interventions may recover failing trajectories but also disrupt trajectories that would have succeeded. Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment. Across benchmarks, the test correctly anticipates outcomes: intervention degrades performance on high-success tasks (0 to -26 pp), while yielding a modest improvement on the high-failure ALFWorld benchmark (+2.8 pp, p=0.014). The primary value of our framework is therefore identifying when not to intervene, preventing severe regressions before deployment.

*Yunzhi Shen,Hao Zhou,Xin Huang,Xue Han,Junlan Feng,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PEGRL, a two-stage RL framework using post-editing to improve machine translation efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in RL-based machine translation caused by noisy learning signals and an overwhelming trajectory space.

Method: PEGRL incorporates two stages: using sampled translations for post-editing auxiliary tasks to stabilize training and implementing a task-specific weighting scheme for balanced optimization.

Result: PEGRL showed performance improvements over RL baselines and comparable metrics to advanced systems in experiments across multiple language pairs.

Conclusion: Post-editing can act as an effective auxiliary task in RL, guiding optimization and enhancing both exploration and local fine-tuning for machine translation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong promise for LLM-based machine translation, with recent methods such as GRPO demonstrating notable gains; nevertheless, translation-oriented RL remains challenged by noisy learning signals arising from Monte Carlo return estimation, as well as a large trajectory space that favors global exploration over fine-grained local optimization. We introduce \textbf{PEGRL}, a \textit{two-stage} RL framework that uses post-editing as an auxiliary task to stabilize training and guide overall optimization. At each iteration, translation outputs are sampled to construct post-editing inputs, allowing return estimation in the post-editing stage to benefit from conditioning on the current translation behavior, while jointly supporting both global exploration and fine-grained local optimization. A task-specific weighting scheme further balances the contributions of translation and post-editing objectives, yielding a biased yet more sample-efficient estimator. Experiments on English$\to$Finnish, English$\to$Turkish, and English$\leftrightarrow$Chinese show consistent gains over RL baselines, and for English$\to$Turkish, performance on COMET-KIWI is comparable to advanced LLM-based systems (DeepSeek-V3.2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread use of RAG systems in industrial settings, there is a lack of clarity on their optimal implementation, particularly for medical applications.

Method: The authors undertook a detailed analysis of RAG system components, provided practical alternatives, and conducted evaluations across three task types.

Result: The evaluation unveiled best practices to enhance performance and understand performance-efficiency trade-offs in LLM-based RAG systems.

Conclusion: The study provides a guide for improving RAG systems by outlining optimal practices, especially for applications in specialized domains like medicine.

Abstract: While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been swiftly adopted in industrial applications based on large language models (LLMs), there is no consensus on what are the best practices for building a RAG system in terms of what are the components, how to organize these components and how to implement each component for the industrial applications, especially in the medical domain. In this work, we first carefully analyze each component of the RAG system and propose practical alternatives for each component. Then, we conduct systematic evaluations on three types of tasks, revealing the best practices for improving the RAG system and how LLM-based RAG systems make trade-offs between performance and efficiency.

*Hao Fang,Tianyi Zhang,Tianqu Zhuang,Jiawei Kong,Kuofeng Gao,Bin Chen,Leqi Liang,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a defense against logit-based knowledge distillation of proprietary large language models (LLMs) using a Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary LLMs are economically valuable but vulnerable to adversaries extracting models' knowledge through distillation, particularly via logit-based methods, which lack robust defenses.

Method: The method involves minimizing Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on labels. A transformation matrix is learned to remove distillation-relevant information, optimized with a CMI-driven anti-distillation objective.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces the effectiveness of distillation techniques while maintaining the accuracy of the model's outputs in experiments with multiple LLMs and distillation algorithms.

Conclusion: The approach effectively protects the intellectual property and economic value of LLMs by mitigating knowledge extraction via logit-based distillation while preserving utility.

Abstract: Proprietary large language models (LLMs) embody substantial economic value and are generally exposed only as black-box APIs, yet adversaries can still exploit their outputs to extract knowledge via distillation. Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property.

### [114] [Verified Critical Step Optimization for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03412)
*Mukai Li,Qingcheng Zeng,Tianqing Fang,Zhenwen Liang,Linfeng Song,Qi Liu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Critical Step Optimization (CSO), a post-training method for language model agents that focuses on fine-grained learning from critical decision points while avoiding unnecessary supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training methods suffer from challenges in attributing rewards, introducing noise in step evaluation, and high computational costs in estimating step rewards. The motivation of this paper is to address these limitations by providing a more focused and precise method for improving language model agents.

Method: The proposed method, CSO, identifies critical decision points in failed policy trajectories where alternate actions can change outcomes. It uses a process reward model (PRM) to identify these steps, expert models for proposing quality alternatives, and the policy model itself to verify successful outcomes, ensuring only validated data is used for further training.

Result: Experiments on datasets GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves significant improvements over baseline and other post-training methods, with 37% and 26% performance gains respectively, while requiring supervision on only 16% of steps.

Conclusion: CSO demonstrates the effectiveness of selectively focusing on verifiable critical steps during post-training, offering a computationally efficient and precise way to improve language model agents.

Abstract: As large language model agents tackle increasingly complex long-horizon tasks, effective post-training becomes critical. Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FactNet, a massive open-source resource combining atomic assertions and auditable evidence from Wikipedia, designed to improve trustworthy multilingual systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current grounding resources, which either lack scale and linguistic coverage or do not integrate structured knowledge with textual context, causing issues in utility and trustworthiness of LLMs.

Method: Developed FactNet using a deterministic construction pipeline that ensures every evidence piece is recoverable at byte-level precision, combining atomic assertions with evidence pointers from 316 Wikipedia editions.

Result: FactNet achieves a grounding precision of 92.1%, even in low-resource languages, and includes FactNet-Bench, an evaluation suite for various tasks like Knowledge Graph Completion and Fact Checking.

Conclusion: FactNet is a reliable, reproducible resource that supports the development of trustworthy and verifiable multilingual systems, addressing both grounding and coverage issues.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit remarkable fluency, their utility is often compromised by factual hallucinations and a lack of traceable provenance. Existing resources for grounding mitigate this but typically enforce a dichotomy: they offer either structured knowledge without textual context (e.g., knowledge bases) or grounded text with limited scale and linguistic coverage. To bridge this gap, we introduce FactNet, a massive, open-source resource designed to unify 1.7 billion atomic assertions with 3.01 billion auditable evidence pointers derived exclusively from 316 Wikipedia editions. Unlike recent synthetic approaches, FactNet employs a strictly deterministic construction pipeline, ensuring that every evidence unit is recoverable with byte-level precision. Extensive auditing confirms a high grounding precision of 92.1%, even in long-tail languages. Furthermore, we establish FactNet-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite for Knowledge Graph Completion, Question Answering, and Fact Checking. FactNet provides the community with a foundational, reproducible resource for training and evaluating trustworthy, verifiable multilingual systems.

*Mingxuan Du,Benfeng Xu,Chiwei Zhu,Shaohan Wang,Pengyu Wang,Xiaorui Wang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces A-RAG, an advanced retrieval-augmented generation framework improving retrieval efficiency and adapting dynamically to tasks compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail to utilize the full capabilities of frontier language models in reasoning and tool-use, often missing out on efficiency and scalability improvements that align with language model advancements.

Method: A-RAG introduces hierarchical retrieval interfaces with three tools (keyword search, semantic search, chunk read) to enable adaptive multi-granularity information retrieval. It allows the agent to make retrieval decisions dynamically.

Result: Experiments indicate that A-RAG outperforms previous RAG approaches in open-domain QA benchmarks while retrieving fewer tokens, showcasing efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: A-RAG leverages the advanced capabilities of language models in retrieval tasks effectively, scaling well with model size and compute. The approach unlocks dynamic adaptability in task handling and retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Frontier language models have demonstrated strong reasoning and long-horizon tool-use capabilities. However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how language models develop idiomatic versus linguistically acceptable preferences in Swedish, examining pretraining and fine-tuning from English, using new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how idiomatic competence evolves in language models and to address the challenges models face when adapting to less-resourced languages like Swedish.

Method: Training from scratch and fine-tuning English-pretrained models on Swedish, evaluating using minimal pairs for linguistic acceptability and novel idiomaticity datasets.

Result: Idiomatic competence emerges slower than grammatical and lexical abilities, improves with training, but diminishes with instruction tuning using machine-translated English data.

Conclusion: Idiomatic competence in language models requires careful approaches; over-reliance on machine translation for instruction tuning can degrade idiomatic understanding.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate how language models develop preferences for \textit{idiomatic} as compared to \textit{linguistically acceptable} Swedish, both during pretraining and when adapting a model from English to Swedish. To do so, we train models on Swedish from scratch and by fine-tuning English-pretrained models, probing their preferences at various checkpoints using minimal pairs that differ in linguistic acceptability or idiomaticity. For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B). However, instruction tuning on data machine-translated from English -- the common approach for languages with little or no native instruction data -- causes models to rapidly lose their preference for idiomatic language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the inefficiency in the self-verification processes of Large Reasoning Models and proposes an experience-based test-time framework to optimize this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in Large Reasoning Models' self-verification steps, which are often overused but rarely identify errors.

Method: The authors propose a test-time framework that uses an offline pool of past verification outcomes to estimate when rechecks are unnecessary. Unneeded verifications are suppressed to improve efficiency.

Result: The proposed method reduces token usage by up to 20.3% without sacrificing accuracy, and in some cases, improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Experience-driven suppression of unnecessary self-verification in reasoning models can enhance efficiency while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by generating long reasoning traces with reflection. Through a large-scale empirical analysis, we find that a substantial fraction of reflective steps consist of self-verification (recheck) that repeatedly confirm intermediate results. These rechecks occur frequently across models and benchmarks, yet the vast majority are confirmatory rather than corrective, rarely identifying errors and altering reasoning outcomes. This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed. Across multiple model and benchmarks, our approach reduces token usage up to 20.3% while maintaining the accuracy, and in some datasets even yields accuracy improvements.

TL;DR: FaithRL mitigates hallucination in LLMs by introducing faithfulness-maximization using geometric rewards and step-wise advantage modulation; improving reasoning and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations and over-confidence in reasoning within RLVR pipelines for LLMs by improving reasoning faithfulness.

Method: Introduced FaithRL, which includes a formalized faithfulness-maximization objective, geometric rewards, and faithfulness-aware advantage modulation for step-wise reasoning optimization.

Result: FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates, improves reasoning faithfulness and correctness across diverse LLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: FaithRL is effective in enhancing reasoning faithfulness in LLMs, ensuring robust step-wise modeling while mitigating hallucinations and maintaining correctness.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, most RLVR pipelines rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, providing little supervision over intermediate steps and thus encouraging over-confidence and spurious reasoning, which in turn increases hallucinations. To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly. Our code is available at https://github.com/aintdoin/FaithRL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores whether large language models (LLMs) can generalize tasks across different representations (code, graphs, and natural language) and proposes a two-stage training curriculum to enhance their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in LLMs' ability to perform equally well across different task representations (code, graphs, or natural language), as real-world tasks are frequently specified in natural language.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage data curriculum training LLMs initially on symbolic data (e.g., code, graphs) and subsequently on natural language data for better cross-representation performance.

Result: The two-stage curriculum improved model performance across tasks and families. A demonstration highlighted a 1.5B Qwen model closely matching zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning tasks.

Conclusion: Cross-representation generalization can be enhanced with a proper curriculum, and the success can be interpreted as generative analogy, effectively activated by the proposed training method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained and tested extensively on symbolic representations such as code and graphs, yet real-world user tasks are often specified in natural language. To what extent can LLMs generalize across these representations? Here, we approach this question by studying isomorphic tasks involving procedures represented in code, graphs, and natural language (e.g., scheduling steps in planning). We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning. Finally, our analysis suggests that successful cross-representation generalization can be interpreted as a form of generative analogy, which our curriculum effectively encourages.

*Yuqin Dai,Ning Gao,Wei Zhang,Jie Wang,Zichen Luo,Jinpeng Wang,Yujie Wang,Ruiyuan Wu,Chaozheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEAD introduces a framework to enhance service dialogue performance by overcoming the limitations of low-quality conversational data, using adaptive user modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current service dialogue methods struggle due to reliance on low-quality, noisy human data and the difficulty of simulating goal-oriented user behaviors.

Method: SEAD framework consists of a Profile Controller for generating diverse user states and a User Role-play Model for realistic role-play, creating adaptive training scenarios for agents.

Result: SEAD significantly outperforms other models, improving task completion rates by 17.6% and dialogue efficiency by 11.1%.

Conclusion: SEAD's innovative structure successfully enhances service dialogue capabilities without requiring extensive human annotations, overcoming key limitations in this field.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-domain dialogues. However, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in service dialogues, as they rely on noisy, low-quality human conversation data. This limitation arises from data scarcity and the difficulty of simulating authentic, goal-oriented user behaviors. To address these issues, we propose SEAD (Self-Evolving Agent for Service Dialogue), a framework that enables agents to learn effective strategies without large-scale human annotations. SEAD decouples user modeling into two components: a Profile Controller that generates diverse user states to manage training curriculum, and a User Role-play Model that focuses on realistic role-playing. This design ensures the environment provides adaptive training scenarios rather than acting as an unfair adversary. Experiments demonstrate that SEAD significantly outperforms Open-source Foundation Models and Closed-source Commercial Models, improving task completion rate by 17.6% and dialogue efficiency by 11.1%.

### [122] [Assessing the Impact of Typological Features on Multilingual Machine Translation in the Age of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03551)
*Vitalii Hirak,Jaap Jumelet,Arianna Bisazza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how target language typology influences translation quality in two multilingual translation models while controlling for other factors, finding benefits for alternative decoding strategies for specific languages. A typological dataset for 212 languages is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the persistent quality disparities in multilingual language models due to typological differences across languages, even with advancements in modeling and resources.

Method: The authors analyzed two large pre-trained multilingual models, NLLB-200 (encoder-decoder) and Tower+ (decoder-only), across a wide range of languages, controlling for resource levels and writing scripts. They focused on how typological properties influence translation performance and proposed an alternative decoding approach for certain languages.

Result: The study found that typological characteristics significantly influence translation quality for both models. It also identified that languages with specific typological traits benefit from a broader search in the decoding process, indicating potential improvements with alternative strategies.

Conclusion: Language typology is a key factor in translation quality, even after accounting for external variables like training resources. Alternative decoding methods could enhance translation for certain typologies. The released typological dataset will support further research in multilingual translation improvement.

Abstract: Despite major advances in multilingual modeling, large quality disparities persist across languages. Besides the obvious impact of uneven training resources, typological properties have also been proposed to determine the intrinsic difficulty of modeling a language. The existing evidence, however, is mostly based on small monolingual language models or bilingual translation models trained from scratch. We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script. Additionally, languages with certain typological properties benefit more from a wider search of the output space, suggesting that such languages could profit from alternative decoding strategies beyond the standard left-to-right beam search. To facilitate further research in this area, we release a set of fine-grained typological properties for 212 languages of the FLORES+ MT evaluation benchmark.

*Yizhao Gao,Jianyu Wei,Qihao Zhang,Yu Cheng,Shimao Chen,Zhengju Tang,Zihan Jiang,Yifan Song,Hailin Zhang,Liang Zhao,Bo Yang,Gang Wang,Shijie Cao,Fuli Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents 'Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse)' to optimize transformer architecture by combining full and sparse attention layers, addressing token importance computation and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance and computational/memory efficiency of sparse attention mechanisms in transformer models, overcoming limitations of extra proxies and inefficiencies in existing methods.

Method: HySparse interleaves full attention layers with sparse attention layers, where token importance and KV cache for sparse layers are derived from the preceding full attention layer.

Result: HySparse consistently outperforms full attention and hybrid SWA baselines in 7B dense and 80B MoE models, with drastic memory savings and significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: HySparse improves transformer efficiency and scalability through its unique architecture by optimizing token importance handling and KV cache reuse, demonstrating substantial performance gains and memory reduction.

Abstract: This work introduces Hybrid Sparse Attention (HySparse), a new architecture that interleaves each full attention layer with several sparse attention layers. While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies contrastive learning (CL) in supervised settings and addresses conflicts with cross-entropy loss through a novel Aligned Contrastive Learning (ACL) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge wherein cross-entropy loss (CE) and contrastive learning (CL) objectives conflict in supervised settings, limiting CL's applicability.

Method: Introduced ACL framework with: (1) ACL-Embed aligning label embeddings with sample representations; (2) ACL-Grad dynamically resolving conflicts between objectives; (3) ACL-CL optimizing intermediate exits in multi-exit BERT.

Result: Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show ACL improves performance notably, especially with multi-exit BERT, enhancing quality-speed trade-offs for low-latency applications.

Conclusion: ACL successfully resolves conflicts between CE and CL objectives in supervised learning, offering improved performance and efficiency in multi-exit BERT fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite its success in self-supervised learning, contrastive learning is less studied in the supervised setting. In this work, we first use a set of pilot experiments to show that in the supervised setting, the cross-entropy loss objective (CE) and the contrastive learning objective often conflict with each other, thus hindering the applications of CL in supervised settings. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel \underline{A}ligned \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{L}earning (ACL) framework. First, ACL-Embed regards label embeddings as extra augmented samples with different labels and employs contrastive learning to align the label embeddings with its samples' representations. Second, to facilitate the optimization of ACL-Embed objective combined with the CE loss, we propose ACL-Grad, which will discard the ACL-Embed term if the two objectives are in conflict. To further enhance the performances of intermediate exits of multi-exit BERT, we further propose cross-layer ACL (ACL-CL), which is to ask the teacher exit to guide the optimization of student shallow exits. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark results in the following takeaways: (a) ACL-BRT outperforms or performs comparably with CE and CE+SCL on the GLUE tasks; (b) ACL, especially CL-ACL, significantly surpasses the baseline methods on the fine-tuning of multi-exit BERT, thus providing better quality-speed tradeoffs for low-latency applications.

*Su Dong,Qinggang Zhang,Yilin Xiao,Shengyuan Chen,Chuang Zhou,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EA-GraphRAG, an adaptive framework that combines RAG and GraphRAG to efficiently and effectively handle knowledge-intensive tasks with queries of varying complexities, improving accuracy and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of Graph-augmented RAG, which suffers from accuracy drops and latency issues in real-world scenarios due to its rigid application to all query complexities.

Method: The proposed EA-GraphRAG framework dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG through a syntax-aware complexity analysis pipeline. It employs features like a syntactic feature constructor, a complexity scorer, and a score-driven routing policy to optimize query processing.

Result: EA-GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed-query scenarios, enhances accuracy, reduces latency, and outperforms existing benchmarks on diverse QA tasks.

Conclusion: EA-GraphRAG successfully adapts between RAG and GraphRAG based on query complexity, addressing previous limitations, and providing a robust solution for mixed query complexity scenarios in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries.

### [126] [$V_0$: A Generalist Value Model for Any Policy at State Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03584)
*Yi-Kai Zhang,Zhiyuan Yao,Hongyan Hao,Yueqing Sun,Qi Gu,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,De-Chuan Zhan,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces $V_0$, a value model designed to improve efficiency in policy training and deployment for Large Language Models (LLMs) by estimating model performance dynamically without requiring parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the overhead and inefficiencies of coupled value models in Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO) and improve sampling efficiency and performance estimation in LLM training and deployment.

Method: The authors propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model that uses dynamic profiling of LLMs through instruction-performance pair history instead of relying on coupled value models requiring training updates.

Result: $V_0$ enhances Actor-Critic training by predicting rollouts' success rates, redistributes sampling budgets efficiently, and works as a router for instructions during deployment, showing improved cost-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: $V_0$ provides a novel approach to value estimation without retraining, optimizing resource allocation and routing, and demonstrating superior performance and cost-efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods rely on a baseline to measure the relative advantage of an action, ensuring the model reinforces behaviors that outperform its current average capability. In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-bench, a benchmark designed to test language models on their ability to learn and reason using task-specific contexts, showcasing a key bottleneck in current LM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models excel at pre-trained knowledge tasks but struggle to acquire and use task-specific context knowledge for reasoning, a critical skill for real-world applications.

Method: The authors created CL-bench, a benchmark with 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, focusing on context learning tasks requiring domain-specific reasoning and knowledge extraction beyond pre-training.

Result: Evaluated across ten advanced language models, the benchmark revealed only 17.2% average task-solving effectiveness, with the best-performing model (GPT-5.1) achieving 23.7%.

Conclusion: Effective context learning remains a bottleneck for language models. CL-bench provides a crucial step in developing and evaluating models capable of solving complex, context-dependent real-world tasks.

Abstract: Current language models (LMs) excel at reasoning over prompts using pre-trained knowledge. However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios.

*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Yifeng Luo,Huimin Zeng,Man Luo,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORE, a method to control output rankings in LLM-based search engines, ensuring fairness for small businesses and independent creators. CORE achieves significant success in promoting desired content rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of LLM-based search engines disrupts traditional online search mechanisms, posing challenges for small businesses and independent creators due to biased ranking influenced by retrieval order.

Method: CORE optimizes content returned by search engines using three types of optimization content—string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based—to control LLM output rankings.

Result: Experiments on 4 LLMs demonstrated CORE’s high effectiveness with average Promotion Success Rates of 91.4% @Top-5, 86.6% @Top-3, and 80.3% @Top-1 across 15 product categories, outperforming other ranking manipulation approaches.

Conclusion: CORE successfully manipulates LLM-based search rankings, achieving high promotion rates while maintaining content fluency, offering a solution to improve ranking fairness and visibility for less dominant businesses.

Abstract: The way customers search for and choose products is changing with the rise of large language models (LLMs). LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility.
  In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \textbf{C}ontrols \textbf{O}utput \textbf{R}ankings in g\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface.
  Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \textbf{91.4\% @Top-5}, \textbf{86.6\% @Top-3}, and \textbf{80.3\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to better train and evaluate AI systems generating DeepResearch reports by introducing tailored, human-aligned query-specific rubric generators and a new training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in training and evaluating DeepResearch reports due to the absence of verifiable reward signals and the inefficiency of current rubric-based practices.

Method: The method involves creating tailored query-specific rubric generators trained with reinforcement learning using a hybrid reward system combining human preferences and LLM-based rubric ratings. Additionally, a Multi-agent Markov-state workflow is introduced for improved long-horizon reasoning.

Result: The proposed rubric generators provide more discriminative and aligned supervision compared to existing methods. Integrated into the MaMs framework, the system outperforms all open-source baselines and matches leading closed-source models in performance.

Conclusion: The approach improves rubric evaluation granularity and scalability, enhances system alignment with human preferences, and significantly boosts performance of DeepResearch systems.

Abstract: Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in studying Text-to-SQL systems in morphologically rich, low-resource languages like Turkish.

Method: Design and validate BIRDTurk benchmark through controlled translation, preserving SQL logic and semantics. Evaluate prompting, reasoning, and fine-tuning methods on the benchmark.

Result: Turkish language introduces performance challenges due to linguistic structure and underrepresentation in pretraining. Agentic reasoning shows better robustness. Fine-tuning scales effectively with instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: BIRDTurk serves as a reliable testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation, facilitating future research and bridging language gaps.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems have achieved strong performance on English benchmarks, yet their behavior in morphologically rich, low-resource languages remains largely unexplored. We introduce BIRDTurk, the first Turkish adaptation of the BIRD benchmark, constructed through a controlled translation pipeline that adapts schema identifiers to Turkish while strictly preserving the logical structure and execution semantics of SQL queries and databases. Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research.

TL;DR: The paper critiques standard entropy regularization in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) and introduces Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method focusing exploration within a model's trust region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, due to their vast vocabulary and long generation capabilities, are prone to ineffective standard entropy regularization. This is because indiscriminate exploration dilutes probability mass into invalid token spaces, harming reasoning and performance.

Method: The proposed Trust Region Entropy (TRE) method encourages exploration strictly within a model's trust region, avoiding the risks associated with global entropy maximization in LLMs.

Result: Through tasks such as mathematical reasoning, combinatorial search, and preference alignment, the paper shows that TRE outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines.

Conclusion: TRE effectively addresses the shortcomings of global entropy regularization for LLMs, fostering exploration in a controlled manner and delivering consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Entropy regularization is a standard technique in reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration, yet it yields negligible effects or even degrades performance in Large Language Models (LLMs). We attribute this failure to the cumulative tail risk inherent to LLMs with massive vocabularies and long generation horizons. In such environments, standard global entropy maximization indiscriminately dilutes probability mass into the vast tail of invalid tokens rather than focusing on plausible candidates, thereby disrupting coherent reasoning. To address this, we propose Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method that encourages exploration strictly within the model's trust region. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning (MATH), combinatorial search (Countdown), and preference alignment (HH) tasks demonstrate that TRE consistently outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines.

TL;DR: The paper investigates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Turkish, creating a dataset from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, and optimizing the RAG pipeline for better factuality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for morphologically rich languages, addressing the lack of guidance beyond English-centric designs.

Method: Constructed a Turkish RAG dataset and benchmarked seven stages of the RAG pipeline, including query transformation, reranking, and answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: HyDE achieved the highest accuracy at 85% compared to the baseline of 78.70%, and a cost-efficient configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking with Context Augmentation performed similarly well with 84.60%. Over-stacking generative modules was found to degrade performance.

Conclusion: Optimized RAG designs for Turkish enhance accuracy while managing cost, demonstrating effective solutions through reranking and simplified query handling instead of over-complication.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM factuality, yet design guidance remains English-centric, limiting insights for morphologically rich languages like Turkish. We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) selectively process multimodal contexts using user instructions, revealing insights into modality arbitration mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the decision-making mechanisms in MLLMs for selective multimodal information use, ensuring safety and reliability in real-world applications.

Method: The authors use an information flow-based analysis to explore mechanisms behind modality arbitration in MLLMs, identifying structural roles of instruction tokens and specialized attention heads.

Result: They found shallow attention layers perform non-selective transfer, deep layers resolve competition based on instruction intent, and only 5% of critical attention heads significantly influence modality arbitration.

Conclusion: This research advances transparency in MLLMs, offers a framework for multimodal information management, and could enhance safe, reliable deployments of such models.

Abstract: Modality following serves as the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to selectively utilize multimodal contexts based on user instructions. It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force. Furthermore, we identify a sparse set of specialized attention heads that drive this arbitration. Causal interventions demonstrate that manipulating a mere $5\%$ of these critical heads can decrease the modality-following ratio by $60\%$ through blocking, or increase it by $60\%$ through targeted amplification of failed samples. Our work provides a substantial step toward model transparency and offers a principled framework for the orchestration of multimodal information in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAtS-L, a novel framework combining linear and softmax attention dynamically within the same layer to improve computational efficiency and expressivity in long-context scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck caused by quadratic computational complexity of softmax transformers and the limited expressivity of linear attention models.

Method: Develop NAtS-L, which dynamically selects between linear and softmax attention at the token level based on whether a token has short-term or long-term impact.

Result: NAtS-L provides an efficient token-level hybrid architecture by optimizing the combination of Gated DeltaNet and softmax attention across tokens.

Conclusion: NAtS-L successfully combines efficiency and expressivity, offering improvements over current transformer models in long-context scenarios.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of softmax transformers has become a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. In contrast, linear attention model families provide a promising direction towards a more efficient sequential model. These linear attention models compress past KV values into a single hidden state, thereby efficiently reducing complexity during both training and inference. However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state. Previous work proposed interleaving softmax and linear attention layers to reduce computational complexity while preserving expressivity. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries. By searching for optimal Gated DeltaNet and softmax attention combinations across tokens, we show that NAtS-L provides a strong yet efficient token-level hybrid architecture.

TL;DR: BAR-RAG targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone for better evidence selection in RAG systems, addressing retrieval noise and improving performance through reinforcement learning and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems struggle with retrieval noise and often fail to select evidence that is optimal for the generator, limiting accuracy and robustness.

Method: BAR-RAG introduces a boundary-aware reranker trained with reinforcement learning based on generator feedback, along with a fine-tuned two-stage pipeline to address distribution mismatch.

Result: BAR-RAG achieves a 10.3% performance improvement on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks over existing baselines, enhancing robustness under noisy retrieval.

Conclusion: BAR-RAG provides a novel approach to improve evidence selection and generator training, significantly boosting end-to-end performance in noisy retrieval settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain brittle under realistic retrieval noise, even when the required evidence appears in the top-K results. A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness.

TL;DR: OCRTurk is a benchmark for Turkish document parsing, focusing on layout elements and diverse document types across difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for document parsing primarily target high-resource languages and lack coverage for low-resource languages like Turkish, leading to a gap in standardized evaluation for real-world diverse documents.

Method: The paper introduces OCRTurk, comprising 180 Turkish documents categorized into academic, theses, slides, and non-academic, evaluated across three difficulty levels. Seven OCR models were tested using element-wise metrics.

Result: PaddleOCR outperformed others in overall metrics, particularly for Normalized Edit Distance across difficulty levels, except in parsing figures. Performance was found to vary by document type, with non-academic documents showing the highest success and slideshow documents being the most challenging.

Conclusion: OCRTurk offers a robust, highly diverse evaluation framework for Turkish document parsing. It identifies model strengths and weaknesses, paving the way for improved OCR systems tailored for different document complexities.

Abstract: Document parsing is now widely used in applications, such as large-scale document digitization, retrieval-augmented generation, and domain-specific pipelines in healthcare and education. Benchmarking these models is crucial for assessing their reliability and practical robustness. Existing benchmarks mostly target high-resource languages and provide limited coverage for low-resource settings, such as Turkish. Moreover, existing studies on Turkish document parsing lack a standardized benchmark that reflects real-world scenarios and document diversity. To address this gap, we introduce OCRTurk, a Turkish document parsing benchmark covering multiple layout elements and document categories at three difficulty levels. OCRTurk consists of 180 Turkish documents drawn from academic articles, theses, slide decks, and non-academic articles. We evaluate seven OCR models on OCRTurk using element-wise metrics. Across difficulty levels, PaddleOCR achieves the strongest overall results, leading most element-wise metrics except figures and attaining high Normalized Edit Distance scores in easy, medium, and hard subsets. We also observe performance variation by document type. Models perform well on non-academic documents, while slideshows become the most challenging.

TL;DR: The paper presents ReQUESTA, a hybrid framework for generating diverse, cognitively demanding MCQs using LLMs and rule-based components, outperforming single-pass GPT-5 processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated MCQ generation struggles to reliably meet specific cognitive demands, necessitating a more controlled and systematic approach.

Method: ReQUESTA combines LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to divide MCQ creation into subtasks, emphasizing planning, controlled generation, evaluation, and post-processing.

Result: ReQUESTA-generated questions were more challenging, discriminative, and aligned with comprehension tasks than GPT-5 outputs, with better distractor quality and semantic plausibility.

Conclusion: Hybrid frameworks like ReQUESTA can enhance LLM-based artifact generation, making processes more reliable, structured, and effective for specific goals such as academic assessment design.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniRAG-Agent aims to improve long audio-video question answering by addressing inefficiencies in retrieval and reasoning methods, showcasing advanced results in structured testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies in long-horizon omnimodal QA such as costly dense encoding, weak fine-grained retrieval, and lack of proactive planning.

Method: Developed OmniRAG-Agent, featuring retrieval-augmented generation, agent loop for evidence synthesis, and group relative policy optimization for tool use improvement.

Result: OmniRAG-Agent outperformed existing techniques on benchmarks like OmniVideoBench and WorldSense, validating the method through ablations.

Conclusion: OmniRAG-Agent demonstrates the feasibility of effective long audio-video question answering in low-resource environments through innovative mechanisms.

Abstract: Long-horizon omnimodal question answering answers questions by reasoning over text, images, audio, and video. Despite recent progress on OmniLLMs, low-resource long audio-video QA still suffers from costly dense encoding, weak fine-grained retrieval, limited proactive planning, and no clear end-to-end optimization.To address these issues, we propose OmniRAG-Agent, an agentic omnimodal QA method for budgeted long audio-video reasoning. It builds an image-audio retrieval-augmented generation module that lets an OmniLLM fetch short, relevant frames and audio snippets from external banks. Moreover, it uses an agent loop that plans, calls tools across turns, and merges retrieved evidence to answer complex queries. Furthermore, we apply group relative policy optimization to jointly improve tool use and answer quality over time. Experiments on OmniVideoBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni show that OmniRAG-Agent consistently outperforms prior methods under low-resource settings and achieves strong results, with ablations validating each component.

*Ximing Dong,Shaowei Wang,Dayi Lin,Boyuan Chen,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SemanticSpec, a framework to speed up inference in large language models by verifying semantic sequences instead of individual tokens, achieving better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with high latency due to autoregressive decoding, especially in tasks involving lengthy reasoning. Existing speculative decoding methods underperform because they disregard semantic equivalence.

Method: SemanticSpec adopts a semantic-aware approach by verifying entire semantic sequences and using a probability estimation mechanism based on the model's hidden states to evaluate sequence-level likelihoods.

Result: The approach achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B benchmarks with improved efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SemanticSpec enhances inference speed in large reasoning models by leveraging a semantic-aware speculative decoding strategy, solving inefficiencies of token-level verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. The issue is exacerbated in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which generate lengthy chains of thought. While speculative decoding accelerates inference by drafting and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, existing methods operate at the token level and ignore semantic equivalence (i.e., different token sequences expressing the same meaning), leading to inefficient rejections. We propose SemanticSpec, a semantic-aware speculative decoding framework that verifies entire semantic sequences instead of tokens. SemanticSpec introduces a semantic probability estimation mechanism that probes the model's internal hidden states to assess the likelihood of generating sequences with specific meanings.Experiments on four benchmarks show that SemanticSpec achieves up to 2.7x speedup on DeepSeekR1-32B and 2.1x on QwQ-32B, consistently outperforming token-level and sequence-level baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.

*Vynska Amalia Permadi,Xingwei Tan,Nafise Sadat Moosavi,Nikos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ID-MoCQA is a new multi-hop question answering dataset focusing on cultural understanding using Indonesian traditions, highlighting the reasoning challenges of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, most cultural QA benchmarks focus on single-hop questions which might not assess true cultural reasoning skills. This work seeks to address this gap by creating a multi-hop dataset for evaluating LLMs on cultural understanding.

Method: The authors developed ID-MoCQA by transforming single-hop cultural questions into multi-hop reasoning chains based on six types of clues. They applied a rigorous validation pipeline combining expert review and LLM-as-a-judge filtering.

Result: Evaluation with state-of-the-art models shows these systems struggle with nuanced cultural reasoning tasks, revealing gaps in their cultural competency.

Conclusion: ID-MoCQA serves as a crucial benchmark to challenge and improve LLMs' ability to reason about cultural contexts effectively.

Abstract: Understanding culture requires reasoning across context, tradition, and implicit social knowledge, far beyond recalling isolated facts. Yet most culturally focused question answering (QA) benchmarks rely on single-hop questions, which may allow models to exploit shallow cues rather than demonstrate genuine cultural reasoning. In this work, we introduce ID-MoCQA, the first large-scale multi-hop QA dataset for assessing the cultural understanding of large language models (LLMs), grounded in Indonesian traditions and available in both English and Indonesian. We present a new framework that systematically transforms single-hop cultural questions into multi-hop reasoning chains spanning six clue types (e.g., commonsense, temporal, geographical). Our multi-stage validation pipeline, combining expert review and LLM-as-a-judge filtering, ensures high-quality question-answer pairs. Our evaluation across state-of-the-art models reveals substantial gaps in cultural reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced inference. ID-MoCQA provides a challenging and essential benchmark for advancing the cultural competency of LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Branching Relative Policy Optimization (BranPO), a reinforcement learning method designed to improve performance in long-horizon settings without requiring dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of sparse rewards and inefficiencies in learning within agentic reinforcement learning for long-horizon tasks.

Method: The proposed BranPO method builds contrastive supervision by truncating trajectories, resampling continuations, introducing difficulty-aware branch sampling, and masking redundant steps for better efficiency.

Result: Experiments show BranPO outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher accuracy on long-horizon tasks like question answering without increasing computational budgets.

Conclusion: BranPO offers a practical and efficient solution for reinforcement learning in long-horizon scenarios, enhancing model performance while remaining cost-effective.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning has enabled large language models to perform complex multi-turn planning and tool use. However, learning in long-horizon settings remains challenging due to sparse, trajectory-level outcome rewards. While prior tree-based methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often suffer from high variance and computational inefficiency. Through empirical analysis of search agents, We identify a common pattern: performance diverges mainly due to decisions near the tail. Motivated by this observation, we propose Branching Relative Policy Optimization (BranPO), a value-free method that provides step-level contrastive supervision without dense rewards. BranPO truncates trajectories near the tail and resamples alternative continuations to construct contrastive suffixes over shared prefixes, reducing credit ambiguity in long-horizon rollouts. To further boost efficiency and stabilize training, we introduce difficulty-aware branch sampling to adapt branching frequency across tasks, and redundant step masking to suppress uninformative actions. Extensive experiments on various question answering benchmarks demonstrate that BranPO consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains on long-horizon tasks without increasing the overall training budget.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ComprExIT, a framework for efficient long-context compression for LLMs, addressing key structural limitations of existing methods and achieving superior performance with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally costly for handling long contexts due to quadratic attention and expanding key-value caches, necessitating efficient context compression methods.

Method: ComprExIT explicitly transmits information by leveraging frozen LLM hidden states and using depth-wise and width-wise information transmission strategies. This decouples compression from self-attention dynamics and improves token representation.

Result: ComprExIT achieves consistent outperformance on six question-answering benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods, with only ~1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: Explicit and coordinated information transmission enhances long-context compression, making it more effective and robust for LLMs.

Abstract: Long-context inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly due to quadratic attention and growing key-value caches, motivating context compression. In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only ~1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust long-context compression.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CROSS-ALIGN+, a framework for detecting meme-based social abuse by addressing cultural blindness, boundary ambiguity, and lack of interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve meme-based abuse detection, which is challenging due to issues like cultural symbolism, satire-abuse distinction, and opaque reasoning in existing models.

Method: CROSS-ALIGN+ utilizes a three-stage framework: enriching multimodal representations (via knowledge bases), sharpening decision boundaries with LoRA adapters, and providing interpretability via cascaded explanations.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks and LVLMs show that CROSS-ALIGN+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving F1 by up to 17% and offering interpretable justifications.

Conclusion: CROSS-ALIGN+ effectively addresses limitations in meme-based abuse detection, advancing state-of-the-art performance while enhancing model transparency and cultural awareness.

Abstract: Meme-based social abuse detection is challenging because harmful intent often relies on implicit cultural symbolism and subtle cross-modal incongruence. Prior approaches, from fusion-based methods to in-context learning with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), have made progress but remain limited by three factors: i) cultural blindness (missing symbolic context), ii) boundary ambiguity (satire vs. abuse confusion), and iii) lack of interpretability (opaque model reasoning). We introduce CROSS-ALIGN+, a three-stage framework that systematically addresses these limitations: (1) Stage I mitigates cultural blindness by enriching multimodal representations with structured knowledge from ConceptNet, Wikidata, and Hatebase; (2) Stage II reduces boundary ambiguity through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters that sharpen decision boundaries; and (3) Stage III enhances interpretability by generating cascaded explanations. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks and eight LVLMs demonstrate that CROSS-ALIGN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 17% relative F1 improvement while providing interpretable justifications for each decision.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the untapped potential of large language models (LLMs) in expert-level mathematical discovery and theoretical research.

Method: The paper showcases case studies utilizing Gemini-based AI models to assist in solving problems, refuting conjectures, and generating proofs. Techniques like iterative refinement and neuro-symbolic loops are highlighted.

Result: Case studies demonstrate successful human-AI collaboration in diverse scientific fields, with examples of AI detecting flaws in proofs and autonomously executing code for verification.

Conclusion: AI models, beyond automation, can act as collaborative partners, aiding researchers in creative and novel scientific discovery across disciplines.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free controller, Parallel-Probe, to optimize online parallel thinking via 2D probing, significantly enhancing computational efficiency with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiencies of parallel thinking, especially the lack of mechanisms utilizing global dynamics across branches.

Method: The use of 2D probing to monitor width-depth dynamics, introducing Parallel-Probe with consensus-based early stopping and deviation-based branch pruning.

Result: Parallel-Probe reduces sequential tokens by up to 35.8% and total token cost by over 25.8% with competitive accuracy compared to majority voting.

Conclusion: Parallel-Probe provides an efficient approach to online parallel thinking, achieving a better trade-off between computational cost and performance.

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce $\textbf{Parallel-Probe}$, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to $\textbf{35.8}$% and total token cost by over $\textbf{25.8}$% while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR:  WorldVQA is a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the atomic visual world knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on memorization of visual entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously assess and standardize the measurement of how MLLMs ground and memorize visual entities, separate from reasoning capabilities.

Method: WorldVQA decouples visual knowledge retrieval and reasoning by testing the models on grounding and naming visual entities, using a stratified taxonomy covering common objects to rarities.

Result: WorldVQA provides a means to measure visual factuality, hallucination rates, and encyclopedic coverage in MLLMs, offering a benchmark to assess current and future generation models.

Conclusion: WorldVQA establishes a rigorous and standardized evaluation metric for testing the visual factual knowledge of MLLMs, serving as a major tool for assessing their grounding in the atomic visual world.

Abstract: We introduce WorldVQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the atomic visual world knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike current evaluations, which often conflate visual knowledge retrieval with reasoning, WorldVQA decouples these capabilities to strictly measure "what the model memorizes." The benchmark assesses the atomic capability of grounding and naming visual entities across a stratified taxonomy, spanning from common head-class objects to long-tail rarities. We expect WorldVQA to serve as a rigorous test for visual factuality, thereby establishing a standard for assessing the encyclopedic breadth and hallucination rates of current and next-generation frontier models.

### [149] [AdaptMMBench: Benchmarking Adaptive Multimodal Reasoning for Mode Selection and Reasoning Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02676)
*Xintong Zhang,Xiaowen Zhang,Jongrong Wu,Zhi Gao,Shilin Yan,Zhenxin Diao,Kunpeng Gao,Xuanyan Chen,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaptMMBench, a benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of Vision-Language Models fail to capture dynamic difficulty relative to model capacities, obscuring adaptive reasoning mode distinctions and neglecting detailed process analysis.

Method: AdaptMMBench evaluates multimodal reasoning across five domains, using Matthews Correlation Coefficient to measure reasoning selection and multi-dimensional analysis for process evaluation.

Result: The evaluation shows adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity but separates from accuracy. Performance correlates with key step coverage, while tool effectiveness varies across architectures.

Conclusion: AdaptMMBench provides a refined evaluation framework that highlights complexities in adaptive reasoning, facilitating deeper insights into models' capabilities and efficiency.

Abstract: Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.

*Jinglun Yu,Yaning Wang,Wenhan Guo,Yuan Gao,Yu Sun,Jin U. Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework incorporating physics-based modeling for enhanced OCT parameter recovery and imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in OCT such as attenuation, speckle noise, and parameter coupling for obtaining accurate tissue characterizations.

Method: A regularized end-to-end deep learning framework with physics-based OCT forward model, trained on Monte Carlo-simulated datasets.

Result: Improved resolution, robust optical parameter recovery, and enhanced structural fidelity in synthetic corneal OCT datasets.

Conclusion: Physics-informed deep learning enables quantitative tissue characterization and enhances OCT capability.

Abstract: Inverse scattering in optical coherence tomography (OCT) seeks to recover both structural images and intrinsic tissue optical properties, including refractive index, scattering coefficient, and anisotropy. This inverse problem is challenging due to attenuation, speckle noise, and strong coupling among parameters. We propose a regularized end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly reconstructs optical parameter maps and speckle-reduced OCT structural intensity for layer visualization. Trained with Monte Carlo-simulated ground truth, our network incorporates a physics-based OCT forward model that generates predicted signals from the estimated parameters, providing physics-consistent supervision for parameter recovery and artifact suppression. Experiments on the synthetic corneal OCT dataset demonstrate robust optical map recovery under noise, improved resolution, and enhanced structural fidelity. This approach enables quantitative multi-parameter tissue characterization and highlights the benefit of combining physics-informed modeling with deep learning for computational OCT.

*Haruhiko Murata,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViT) are limited in distinguishing foreground from background due to global self-attention. The paper proposes SVD-ViT using singular value decomposition to enhance foreground learning and classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT lacks an explicit mechanism to differentiate foreground and background, often learning unnecessary background features, which degrades classification performance.

Method: The paper introduces SVD-ViT, incorporating SPC module, SSVA, and ID-RSVD to leverage singular value decomposition for prioritizing foreground features and suppressing background noise.

Result: SVD-ViT outperforms conventional ViT in classification accuracy and learns superior foreground representations while minimizing background noise effects.

Conclusion: SVD-ViT effectively addresses ViT's limitations with respect to foreground-background distinction, improving feature learning and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have been established as large-scale foundation models. However, because self-attention operates globally, they lack an explicit mechanism to distinguish foreground from background. As a result, ViT may learn unnecessary background features and artifacts, leading to degraded classification performance. To address this issue, we propose SVD-ViT, which leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to prioritize the learning of foreground features. SVD-ViT consists of three components-\textbf{SPC module}, \textbf{SSVA}, and \textbf{ID-RSVD}-and suppresses task-irrelevant factors such as background noise and artifacts by extracting and aggregating singular vectors that capture object foreground information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves classification accuracy and effectively learns informative foreground representations while reducing the impact of background noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT) for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds, handling cross-species learning effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual anatomical landmarking is time-consuming and inconsistent, and rule-based methods lack flexibility. This research aims to develop an automated system to improve landmark detection across species.

Method: The proposed method, LmPT, uses a conditioning mechanism to analyze anatomical surfaces as point clouds, enabling adaptability for cross-species learning. It focuses on femoral landmarking in humans and dogs.

Result: LmPT effectively detects landmarks on both human and dog femurs, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across species.

Conclusion: LmPT proves to be a reliable and generalizable method for anatomical landmark detection, particularly beneficial for translational research. Code and datasets are made publicly accessible.

Abstract: Accurate identification of anatomical landmarks is crucial for various medical applications. Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning. We focus the evaluation of our approach on femoral landmarking using both human and newly annotated dog femurs, demonstrating its generalization and effectiveness across species. The code and dog femur dataset will be publicly available at: https://github.com/Pierreoo/LandmarkPointTransformer.

*Keqi Chen,Vinkle Srivastav,Armine Vardazaryan,Cindy Rolland,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework for anonymizing videos in operating room research using whole-body detection and pose estimation without annotations or camera calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation is necessary for using video data in operating room research, but current anonymization methods require extensive manual corrections and calibration, which limits scalability.

Method: The approach uses an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector with low-score threshold, retrieves false negatives using temporal and multi-view context via tracking and association, iteratively fine-tunes detectors using pseudo labels, and applies pose estimation.

Result: The method achieves over 97% recall on simulated and real surgery datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in high recall detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework resolves scalability issues in OR video anonymization by eliminating the need for manual annotations and camera calibration, achieving real-time performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Privacy preservation is a prerequisite for using video data in Operating Room (OR) research. Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by "retrieving" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability. Code is available at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/OR_anonymization.

### [154] [ViThinker: Active Vision-Language Reasoning via Dynamic Perceptual Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02873)
*Weihang You,Qingchan Zhu,David Liu,Yi Pan,Geng Yuan,Hanqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViThinker enhances vision-language models with active query generation, improving reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in vision-language models struggles due to premature visual-to-text conversion losing critical spatial information. Current methods rely on passive processing rather than active detail exploration.

Method: ViThinker enables vision-language models to autonomously generate 'query tokens' to request task-specific visual features. It employs a two-stage curriculum: first distilling vision-expert capabilities, then learning sparse task-driven queries.

Result: ViThinker exhibits consistent improvements in vision-centric benchmarks regarding perceptual grounding and reasoning accuracy. Active query generation outperforms passive methods.

Conclusion: Active perception through ViThinker enables more effective and efficient reasoning in vision-language models. Its active query mechanism highlights the advantage of minimal sufficient perception tailored to each task.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning excels in language models but struggles in vision-language models due to premature visual-to-text conversion that discards continuous information such as geometry and spatial layout. While recent methods enhance CoT through static enumeration or attention-based selection, they remain passive, i.e., processing pre-computed inputs rather than actively seeking task-relevant details. Inspired by human active perception, we introduce ViThinker, a framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously generate decision (query) tokens triggering the synthesis of expert-aligned visual features on demand. ViThinker internalizes vision-expert capabilities during training, performing generative mental simulation during inference without external tool calls. Through a two-stage curriculum: first distilling frozen experts into model parameters, then learning task-driven querying via sparsity penalties, i.e., ViThinker discovers minimal sufficient perception for each reasoning step. Evaluations across vision-centric benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, validating that active query generation outperforms passive approaches in both perceptual grounding and reasoning accuracy.

### [155] [FOVI: A biologically-inspired foveated interface for deep vision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03766)
*Nicholas M. Blauch,George A. Alvarez,Talia Konkle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a foveated vision interface (FOVI) inspired by human vision and presents methods for efficient processing of visual data using kNN-convolutions and a foveated variant of a ViT model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer vision systems process images at uniform resolution, which is computationally expensive for full-field high-resolution images. The authors aim to develop a system inspired by the efficiency of human foveated vision.

Method: The authors propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) that mimics the retina and V1 visual cortex, reformats a retina-like sensor into a uniformly dense structure, uses k-nearest-neighbors (kNN)-convolutions, and adapts the DINOv3 ViT model for efficient vision tasks.

Result: The proposed systems achieve competitive performance while significantly reducing computational costs compared to non-foveated baselines.

Conclusion: FOVI unlocks efficient and scalable methods for high-resolution vision tasks, demonstrating the potential of biologically inspired vision systems for computer vision.

Abstract: Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

### [156] [DoubleTake: Contrastive Reasoning for Faithful Decision-Making in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02894)
*Daivik Patel,Shrenik Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for improved decision-making in medical imaging, focusing on selecting evidence that enhances discrimination, achieving significant performance improvements on the MediConfusion benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical imaging decision-making systems often fail due to reliance on redundant evidence and single hypothesis reinforcement, prompting a need for contrastive reasoning with diverse and relevant references.

Method: The authors propose a document-aware reference selection framework using ROCO embeddings to balance relevance, diversity, and metadata, coupled with a reproducible protocol and a curated reference bank. This is integrated with a confidence-aware reasoning framework that uses pairwise visual comparisons and margin-based decision rules.

Result: Their approach improves set-level accuracy by nearly 15% and enhances individual accuracy while reducing confusion in medical image reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates that contrastive, structured evidence selection and reasoning significantly improve diagnostic decision-making and could set a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Accurate decision making in medical imaging requires reasoning over subtle visual differences between confusable conditions, yet most existing approaches rely on nearest neighbor retrieval that returns redundant evidence and reinforces a single hypothesis. We introduce a contrastive, document-aware reference selection framework that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity by explicitly balancing visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention. On the MediConfusion benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving set-level accuracy by nearly 15% relative to prior methods while reducing confusion and improving individual accuracy.

*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates privacy-preserving face recognition methods and highlights their weakness through a new attack named FaceLinkGen that bypasses traditional privacy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing privacy-preserving face recognition evaluations that rely on pixel-based distortion metrics, which fail to measure real privacy.

Method: The authors introduce FaceLinkGen, an attack capable of extracting identity information, performing matching, and regenerating faces directly from protected templates.

Result: FaceLinkGen achieves over 98.5% matching accuracy and 96% regeneration success on three PPFR systems, revealing flaws in traditional pixel-level privacy evaluations.

Conclusion: Current privacy-preserving face recognition systems using pixel distortion metrics do not adequately protect identity information, as visual obfuscation exposes identities to attackers or untrusted providers.

Abstract: Transformation-based privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) aims to verify identities while hiding facial data from attackers and malicious service providers. Existing evaluations mostly treat privacy as resistance to pixel-level reconstruction, measured by PSNR and SSIM. We show that this reconstruction-centric view fails. We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\% matching accuracy and above 96\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\% matching and 94\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting. These results expose a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy. We show that visual obfuscation leaves identity information broadly exposed to both external intruders and untrusted service providers.

*Jagan Mohan Reddy Dwarampudi,Joshua Wong,Hien Van Nguyen,Tania Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARBLE, a multi-scale, Mamba-based MIL framework for efficient whole-slide image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of WSI analysis due to gigapixel resolutions, hierarchical magnifications, and inefficiencies in existing methods relying on single scales or quadratic attention costs.

Method: MARBLE uses a purely Mamba-based multi-scale MIL framework processing multiple magnification levels in parallel with a linear-time state-space model for coarse-to-fine reasoning.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrated significant improvements: up to 6.9% in AUC, 20.3% in accuracy, and 2.3% in C-index.

Conclusion: MARBLE is proposed as an efficient, scalable, and modular alternative for multi-scale WSI analysis, outperforming existing frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Recurrent Biomedical Linear-time Encoder (MARBLE), the first \textit{purely Mamba-based} multi-state multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. MARBLE processes multiple magnification levels in parallel and integrates coarse-to-fine reasoning within a linear-time state-space model, efficiently capturing cross-scale dependencies with minimal parameter overhead. WSI analysis remains challenging due to gigapixel resolutions and hierarchical magnifications, while existing MIL methods typically operate at a single scale and transformer-based approaches suffer from quadratic attention costs. By coupling parallel multi-scale processing with linear-time sequence modeling, MARBLE provides a scalable and modular alternative to attention-based architectures. Experiments on five public datasets show improvements of up to \textbf{6.9\%} in AUC, \textbf{20.3\%} in accuracy, and \textbf{2.3\%} in C-index, establishing MARBLE as an efficient and generalizable framework for multi-scale WSI analysis.

*OFM Riaz Rahman Aranya,Kevin Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic medical images fail to improve segmentation due to domain gaps. SRA-Seg bridges these gaps, using techniques like similarity-alignment loss and soft edge blending. It outperforms existing methods, achieving high performance even with a small amount of real labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data fails to enhance medical image segmentation due to semantic differences between synthetic and real images, creating a domain gap.

Method: SRA-Seg framework aligns synthetic and real feature distributions using frozen DINOv2 embeddings, similarity-alignment loss, soft edge blending, and pseudo-labeling with an EMA teacher model.

Result: Using 10% labeled real and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves sector-leading results: 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% Dice on FIVES, outperforming semi-supervised methods, including those using real unlabeled data.

Conclusion: SRA-Seg effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real images, enabling synthetic data to contribute significantly to medical image segmentation alongside minimal real data.

Abstract: Synthetic data, an appealing alternative to extensive expert-annotated data for medical image segmentation, consistently fails to improve segmentation performance despite its visual realism. The reason being that synthetic and real medical images exist in different semantic feature spaces, creating a domain gap that current semi-supervised learning methods cannot bridge. We propose SRA-Seg, a framework explicitly designed to align synthetic and real feature distributions for medical image segmentation. SRA-Seg introduces a similarity-alignment (SA) loss using frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward their nearest real counterparts in semantic space. We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data.

*Yihong Huang,Fei Ma,Yihua Shao,Jingcai Guo,Zitong Yu,Laizhong Cui,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new two-stage token pruning framework, 'Nüwa,' addressing limitations in Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly their performance on visual grounding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve token pruning in VLMs to achieve better performance in visual grounding tasks, which suffer using current methods that lose global spatial references.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Vision encoder - operations inspired by swarm intelligence to maintain spatial anchors (separation, alignment, aggregation). (2) Guided pruning within LLM to focus on task-relevant tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving visual question answering accuracy from 94% to 95% and visual grounding accuracy from 7% to 47%.

Conclusion: The proposed method (Nüwa) effectively aggregates features while preserving spatial integrity, thus enhancing performance in both VQA and VG tasks.

Abstract: Vision token pruning has proven to be an effective acceleration technique for the efficient Vision Language Model (VLM). However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).

*OFM Riaz Rahman Aranya,Kevin Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRACE is a novel model for comparing chest X-rays temporally, detecting changes, and providing spatial localization with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models effectively handle single-image report generation but lack tools for temporal change detection in chest X-rays.

Method: TRACE jointly learns temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization using prior and current chest X-rays to generate language descriptions and bounding box coordinates.

Result: TRACE achieved over 90% grounding accuracy and demonstrated the importance of learning both temporal comparison and spatial grounding together.

Conclusion: TRACE advances radiological analysis by enabling interval change description and localization, emphasizing the combined approach of temporal comparisons and spatial attention.

Abstract: Temporal comparison of chest X-rays is fundamental to clinical radiology, enabling detection of disease progression, treatment response, and new findings. While vision-language models have advanced single-image report generation and visual grounding, no existing method combines these capabilities for temporal change detection. We introduce Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation (TRACE), the first model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization. Given a prior and current chest X-ray, TRACE generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates. TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task. Our ablation study uncovers an emergent capability: change detection arises only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are jointly learned, as neither alone enables meaningful change detection. This finding suggests that grounding provides a spatial attention mechanism essential for temporal reasoning.

### [162] [Dynamic High-frequency Convolution for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02969)
*Ruojing Li,Chao Xiao,Qian Yin,Wei An,Nuo Chen,Xinyi Ying,Miao Li,Yingqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to enhance infrared small target (SIRST) detection by better handling high-frequency components in images. DHiF improves performance without sacrificing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets are surrounded by high-frequency clutter that makes detection difficult. Current methods neglect explicit modeling and need better representation learning for high-frequency components.

Method: The authors propose DHiF, a dynamic local filter bank based on Fourier transformation properties, to improve the modeling and processing of high-frequency components. DHiF works adaptively and can replace standard convolutions.

Result: DHiF achieves superior detection performance across different SIRST networks and datasets with promising improvements and without increasing computation cost.

Conclusion: DHiF is an effective and efficient enhancement for SIRST detection, showcasing its value in handling high-frequency components and boosting detection accuracy.

Abstract: Infrared small targets are typically tiny and locally salient, which belong to high-frequency components (HFCs) in images. Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is challenging, since there are many HFCs along with targets, such as bright corners, broken clouds, and other clutters. Current learning-based methods rely on the powerful capabilities of deep networks, but neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various HFCs, which is important to distinguish targets from other HFCs. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to translate the discriminative modeling process into the generation of a dynamic local filter bank. Especially, DHiF is sensitive to HFCs, owing to the dynamic parameters of its generated filters being symmetrically adjusted within a zero-centered range according to Fourier transformation properties. Combining with standard convolution operations, DHiF can adaptively and dynamically process different HFC regions and capture their distinctive grayscale variation characteristics for discriminative representation learning. DHiF functions as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution and can be used in arbitrary SIRST detection networks without significant decrease in computational efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our DHiF, we conducted extensive experiments across different SIRST detection networks on real-scene datasets. Compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, DHiF exhibits superior detection performance with promising improvement. Codes are available at https://github.com/TinaLRJ/DHiF.

*Seok-Young Kim,Dooyoung Kim,Woojin Cho,Hail Song,Suji Kang,Woontack Woo*

TL;DR: SceneLinker is a framework for creating 3D scenes from RGB sequences using semantic scene graphs, excelling in contextual relationships and layout alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable adaptive Mixed Reality (MR) experiences by capturing real-world layouts and semantic cues for personalized 3D content generation.

Method: Utilizes a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and a graph-variational autoencoder for joint shape and layout block 3D scene creation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene generation on 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets, even in challenging environments.

Conclusion: SceneLinker allows users to create realistic 3D scenes from physical environments, supporting the generation of spatial MR content.

Abstract: We introduce SceneLinker, a novel framework that generates compositional 3D scenes via semantic scene graph from RGB sequences. To adaptively experience Mixed Reality (MR) content based on each user's space, it is essential to generate a 3D scene that reflects the real-world layout by compactly capturing the semantic cues of the surroundings. Prior works struggled to fully capture the contextual relationship between objects or mainly focused on synthesizing diverse shapes, making it challenging to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements. We address these challenges by designing a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and constructing a graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE), which consists of a joint shape and layout block for 3D scene generation. Experiments on the 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints. Our work enables users to generate consistent 3D spaces from their physical environments via scene graphs, allowing them to create spatial MR content.

*Byeongju Woo,Zilin Wang,Byeonghyun Pak,Sangwoo Mo,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents CAFT, a hierarchical framework for image-text representation that aligns global and local semantics, excelling in vision-language tasks with long captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models like CLIP struggle with long captions and fail to capture hierarchical semantics due to a mismatch between visual and textual structures.

Method: The authors propose CAFT, a framework using a fine-to-coarse visual encoder, a hierarchical text transformer, and a hierarchical alignment loss to ensure meaningful alignment of image and text components without pixel-level supervision.

Result: CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks for long-text retrieval, demonstrating strong results for image-text alignment.

Conclusion: Hierarchical cross-domain alignment allows for better visually grounded image-text representations, enabling fine-grained understanding without requiring explicit region-level supervision.

Abstract: Large vision-language models such as CLIP struggle with long captions because they align images and texts as undifferentiated wholes. Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SharpTimeGS is a 4D Gaussian framework designed for novel view synthesis, balancing static and dynamic scene modeling and achieving high-quality real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing long-term static and short-term dynamic region representation and optimization in dynamic scene synthesis.

Method: SharpTimeGS introduces a learnable lifespan parameter for temporally adaptive 4D Gaussian modeling, with a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy for handling both static and dynamic areas efficiently.

Result: The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on RTX 4090, and improved modeling of both static and dynamic regions.

Conclusion: SharpTimeGS effectively balances and optimizes static and dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving both long-term stability and dynamic fidelity in real-time rendering.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes is fundamental to achieving photorealistic 4D reconstruction and immersive visual experiences. Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-OPD, a new framework for efficiently optimizing Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) using on-policy distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of GRPO-based methods in TVG, including sparse reward signals and heavy computational requirements.

Method: Propose Video-OPD, which employs on-policy distillation, incorporating a frontier teacher for dense supervision and introducing the TVDF curriculum to enhance training efficiency.

Result: Video-OPD outperforms GRPO by achieving faster convergence and reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: On-policy distillation is demonstrated as an effective alternative to traditional reinforcement learning for TVG.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a principled post-training paradigm for Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) due to its on-policy optimization, yet existing GRPO-based methods remain fundamentally constrained by sparse reward signals and substantial computational overhead. We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG.

*Rahul Atul Bhope,K. R. Jayaram,Vinod Muthusamy,Ritesh Kumar,Vatche Isahagian,Nalini Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOILA is a framework improving Visual Question Answering efficiency by choosing optimal fidelity levels before model execution, leading to significant cost reductions while retaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal vision-language systems incur high computational costs as they mostly operate at fixed fidelity levels, despite varying input demands for different queries.

Method: VOILA utilizes a two-stage pipeline involving a gradient-boosting regressor estimating answer correctness likelihood and an isotonic calibrator refining probabilities for adaptive fidelity selection based on utility and cost.

Result: Across diverse datasets, models, and scenarios, VOILA achieves 50-60% cost reduction while maintaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy.

Conclusion: Pre-retrieval fidelity selection is essential for optimizing multimodal inference under resource constraints, as demonstrated by VOILA's performance improvement and cost savings.

Abstract: Despite significant costs from retrieving and processing high-fidelity visual inputs, most multimodal vision-language systems operate at fixed fidelity levels. We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints.

TL;DR: This paper enhances image inpainting by addressing information loss of structure and texture during convolutional downsampling in CNNs, achieving superior results over state-of-the-arts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of information loss, specifically in structure and texture feature maps, during the convolutional downsampling step of CNN-based image inpainting pipelines.

Method: The authors propose a statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for structure and texture feature maps, improving their mutual guidance during convolutional downsampling.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods for image resolutions of 256x256 and 512x512.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces information loss during convolutional downsampling, enhancing image inpainting performance, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Image inpainting has earned substantial progress, owing to the encoder-and-decoder pipeline, which is benefited from the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with convolutional downsampling to inpaint the masked regions semantically from the known regions within the encoder, coupled with an upsampling process from the decoder for final inpainting output. Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

*Wenzhang Sun,Zhenyu Wang,Zhangchi Hu,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSE, a multi-agent framework for generating long-form audio-visual stories, addressing issues like semantic drift and identity inconsistency via an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating long-form audiovisual stories often fail to maintain narrative coherence and identity consistency due to their dependence on feed-forward processes or prompt-only refinement.

Method: The authors propose MUSE, a framework that translates narrative intent into explicit machine-executable controls and employs a closed-loop (plan-execute-verify-revise) to address inconsistencies during generation.

Result: MUSE demonstrates improved performance in narrative coherence, identity consistency, and cinematic quality as validated by their new reference-free evaluation protocol, MUSEBench, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed MUSE system effectively bridges the intent-execution gap in long-form storytelling, offering superior control over narrative and multimodal consistency compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Generating long-form audio-visual stories from a short user prompt remains challenging due to an intent-execution gap, where high-level narrative intent must be preserved across coherent, shot-level multimodal generation over long horizons. Existing approaches typically rely on feed-forward pipelines or prompt-only refinement, which often leads to semantic drift and identity inconsistency as sequences grow longer. We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop. MUSE translates narrative intent into explicit, machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, and applies targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation. To evaluate open-ended storytelling without ground-truth references, we introduce MUSEBench, a reference-free evaluation protocol validated by human judgments. Experiments demonstrate that MUSE substantially improves long-horizon narrative coherence, cross-modal identity consistency, and cinematic quality compared with representative baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to extend the capabilities of Vision-Language Models to handle complex visual reasoning tasks, such as Bongard problems, which mimic humans' ability to reason in novel situations.

Method: The approach combines VLMs and LLMs to hypothesize and represent potential problem-solving rules programmatically, with parameter fitting achieved through Bayesian optimization.

Result: The method is evaluated on classification tasks based on the ground truth rules of Bongard problems and on solving the problems independently.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic method demonstrates the potential to tackle higher-order visual reasoning tasks, extending the utility of VLMs in reasoning-focused applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made great strides in everyday visual tasks, such as captioning a natural image, or answering commonsense questions about such images. But humans possess the puzzling ability to deploy their visual reasoning abilities in radically new situations, a skill rigorously tested by the classic set of visual reasoning challenges known as the Bongard problems. We present a neurosymbolic approach to solving these problems: given a hypothesized solution rule for a Bongard problem, we leverage LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations for the rule and perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization. We evaluate our method on classifying Bongard problem images given the ground truth rule, as well as on solving the problems from scratch.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HP-GAN, a GAN framework that leverages pretrained networks with self-supervised learning and discriminator consistency to improve image quality and diversity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the image synthesis quality and diversity in GANs by better utilizing pretrained networks and ensuring consistent discriminator evaluation.

Method: HP-GAN employs two strategies: FakeTwins, which uses pretrained networks for a self-supervised loss via generated images, and discriminator consistency, aligning CNN and ViT feature network evaluations during GAN training.

Result: HP-GAN showed superior results across seventeen datasets in data-abundant, scarce, and restricted conditions, leading to better FID scores and enhanced image diversity and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed HP-GAN framework innovatively enhances GAN performance by integrating neural network priors with self-supervised losses and discriminator consistency, offering state-of-the-art improvements in image synthesis.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in enhancing the quality of image synthesis. Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces IVC-Prune, a training-free visual token pruning method for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to reduce inference costs while preserving spatial and semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inference cost of LVLMs with high-resolution visual inputs is prohibitively high, and current token pruning approaches often discard tokens essential for spatial reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes IVC-Prune by identifying implicit visual coordinate (IVC) tokens using the mathematical properties of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) and combines this with a two-stage process for retaining semantically relevant tokens.

Result: IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by about 50%, retains ≥99% of original performance, and even improves the performance on some benchmarks across four LVLMs and twenty benchmarks.

Conclusion: IVC-Prune effectively balances efficiency and performance, making LVLMs more computationally feasible while maintaining their capacity for spatial and semantic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance across multiple tasks. A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\% while maintaining $\geq$ 99\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of 3D pose estimation datasets that capture multi-human interactions in dynamic and real-world environments, contrasting with existing datasets focusing on single-person or controlled lab settings.

Method: The JRDB-Pose3D dataset provides 3D pose annotations, inclusive of SMPL-based and trackable data, for multi-human scenes captured in complex indoor and outdoor environments using a mobile robotic platform.

Result: JRDB-Pose3D offers rich multi-person pose data with challenging real-world annotations and integrates with the JRDB dataset, making it adaptable for perception tasks and human-centered studies.

Conclusion: The dataset fills gaps in real-world 3D pose estimation research by supporting tasks like tracking, activity understanding, and human-robot interaction in environments with up to 35 individuals per frame.

Abstract: Real-world scenes are inherently crowded. Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a training-free inference framework for temporal video grounding, which significantly improves query-relevant segment localization without requiring ground-truth annotations by solving a principled optimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for weakly supervised temporal video grounding rely on Gaussian-based proposals but involve heuristic mappings that lead to suboptimal localization. The motivation is to improve localization performance by addressing these limitations.

Method: The authors propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), which predicts segment boundaries by formulating and solving an optimization problem to balance coverage and compactness. It offers a closed-form solution to achieve optimal localization and works with various proposal architectures without requiring extra training.

Result: GBO achieves state-of-the-art localization results across standard benchmarks and demonstrates efficiency and generalizability in different proposal schemes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that GBO is an effective, training-free solution that enhances localization performance by addressing key issues in heuristic-based methods, providing strong theoretical and practical outcomes across temporal video grounding tasks.

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal video grounding aims to localize query-relevant segments in untrimmed videos using only video-sentence pairs, without requiring ground-truth segment annotations that specify exact temporal boundaries. Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current AI models for musculoskeletal radiographs, which are task-specific, annotation-dependent, and lack generalizability across conditions and anatomical sites.

Method: The paper introduces SKELEX, which uses self-supervised learning on a large-scale dataset of 1.2 million diverse radiographs to train a generalizable AI model.

Result: SKELEX outperformed baselines in 12 diagnostic tasks including fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. It also showed zero-shot abnormality localization.

Conclusion: SKELEX establishes a scalable and generalizable AI framework for musculoskeletal imaging, facilitating clinical applications and data-efficient research in radiology.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in detecting and characterizing musculoskeletal diseases from radiographs. However, most existing models remain task-specific, annotation-dependent, and limited in generalizability across diseases and anatomical regions. Although a generalizable foundation model trained on large-scale musculoskeletal radiographs is clinically needed, publicly available datasets remain limited in size and lack sufficient diversity to enable training across a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions and anatomical sites. Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application. Overall, SKELEX provides a scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable AI framework for musculoskeletal imaging, establishing a foundation for both clinical translation and data-efficient research in musculoskeletal radiology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance of semantic correspondence tasks, addressing the computational expense of current methods using large foundation models like Stable Diffusion.

Method: Proposes using an optimal transport algorithm with Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior, replacing traditional nearest neighbors matching and Stable Diffusion features for semantic correspondence.

Result: Significantly boosts the baseline performance of DINOv2, achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods, and is 5--10x more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic correspondence while being considerably more computationally efficient, providing a practical and effective alternative to ensemble approaches using large models.

Abstract: Establishing correspondences between image pairs is a long studied problem in computer vision. With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoAug, an automated pipeline using generative models and evolutionary algorithms for optimal image augmentation, achieving performance gains in fine-grained and few-shot learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentations like AutoAugment are limited in diversity and rely heavily on manual or task-specific designs. Generative approaches enable diverse augmentations, but aligning them with task-specific needs is challenging.

Method: The method includes leveraging generative models and evolutionary algorithms to learn hierarchical and adaptive stochastic augmentation trees for optimal transformations.

Result: EvoAug demonstrates strong performance in fine-grained classification and few-shot learning, showing adaptability and alignment with domain-specific needs, even in low-data settings.

Conclusion: Learned generative augmentations, like EvoAug, hold potential for broadening the scope of robust model training, providing tailored and effective augmentations.

Abstract: Data augmentation has long been a cornerstone for reducing overfitting in vision models, with methods like AutoAugment automating the design of task-specific augmentations. Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training.

*Fanxiao Wani Qiu,Oscar Leong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares how children and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn from minimal data in identical learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand differences and similarities between human and machine learning processes, especially under conditions of sparse data.

Method: The study used a species-fair design to compare children and CNNs in a few-shot semi-supervised learning task with variations in supervision, feature type, and perceptual alignment.

Result: Children generalized quickly but had feature biases and sensitivity to alignment, while CNNs improved with added labels but were influenced differently by feature structure and alignment.

Conclusion: Human-model comparisons need to account for interactions among supervision, feature structures, and alignment instead of focusing solely on performance metrics like accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding how humans and machines learn from sparse data is central to cognitive science and machine learning. Using a species-fair design, we compare children and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a few-shot semi-supervised category learning task. Both learners are exposed to novel object categories under identical conditions. Learners receive mixtures of labeled and unlabeled exemplars while we vary supervision (1/3/6 labels), target feature (size, shape, pattern), and perceptual alignment (high/low). We find that children generalize rapidly from minimal labels but show strong feature-specific biases and sensitivity to alignment. CNNs show a different interaction profile: added supervision improves performance, but both alignment and feature structure moderate the impact additional supervision has on learning. These results show that human-model comparisons must be drawn under the right conditions, emphasizing interactions among supervision, feature structure, and alignment rather than overall accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of depth ambiguity, occlusion, and the need for large paired 2D-3D data in 3D human pose estimation tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a diffusion model-based approach under the guidance framework for conditional generation, utilizing gradients from 2D keypoint detectors to guide samples from an unconditional diffusion model trained on 3D data.

Result: Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human 3.6M dataset, demonstrates competitive generalization on MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets, and showcases flexibility for novel tasks such as pose generation and completion.

Conclusion: Diffusion models offer an effective solution for 3D human pose estimation, overcoming data and generalization issues while enabling broader applications like pose generation and pose completion.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from 2D images is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models.

TL;DR: FinMTM introduces a multi-turn multimodal benchmark for financial QA grounded in specialized visual data, enhancing evaluation across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial benchmarks lack diversity in question formats and fail to evaluate realistic financial application scenarios effectively.

Method: FinMTM provides 11,133 bilingual financial QA pairs across various visuals and tasks, along with task-specific evaluation protocols for diverse question types.

Result: Evaluation of 22 VLMs showed limitations in visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.

Conclusion: FinMTM addresses gaps in financial benchmarks through diversified formats and tasks, providing insights into VLMs' strengths and weaknesses in the financial domain.

Abstract: The financial domain poses substantial challenges for vision-language models (VLMs) due to specialized chart formats and knowledge-intensive reasoning requirements. However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows.

*Chen Qian,Xinran Yu,Danyang Li,Guoxuan Chi,Zheng Yang,Qiang Ma,Xin Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SwiftVLM, a new method for visual token pruning in vision-language models using a bypass paradigm to avoid loss of critical information from early pruning, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of performance degradation in fine-grained visual reasoning tasks caused by premature and irreversible visual token pruning in vision-language models.

Method: The paper introduces a bypass pruning paradigm that preserves unselected tokens for later stages, and SwiftVLM, a training-free approach with model-specific pruning layers that allow for independent layer-wise pruning decisions.

Result: SwiftVLM consistently performs better than existing pruning methods, delivering more accurate and efficient results across various benchmarks and vision-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed SwiftVLM method ensures more faithful token selection and improves the balance between computational efficiency and accuracy in vision-language models.

Abstract: Visual token pruning is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of vision-language models (VLMs), and existing methods often rely on early pruning decisions to improve efficiency. While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSOD-VFM, a framework for few-shot object detection, leverages vision foundation models and introduces confidence reweighting using graph diffusion to enhance detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of few-shot object detection by utilizing vision foundation models while mitigating the issue of fragmented and false-positive bounding box proposals.

Method: FSOD-VFM combines Universal Proposal Network (UPN), SAM2 for mask extraction, DINOv2 features for adaption, and a graph-based confidence reweighting to refine bounding box scores.

Result: The approach achieves superior performance on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, with FSOD-VFM significantly outperforming previous methods (31.6 AP vs 21.4 AP on CD-FSOD dataset).

Conclusion: FSOD-VFM demonstrates the ability to improve detection granularity, reduce false positives, and deliver state-of-the-art results in few-shot object detection without additional training.

Abstract: In this paper, we present FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detectors with Vision Foundation Models, a framework that leverages vision foundation models to tackle the challenge of few-shot object detection. FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

*Tianhe Wu,Ruibin Li,Lei Zhang,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), an efficient approach to enhance distribution matching distillation (DMD) by preserving sample diversity while maintaining high visual quality, without extra computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMD suffers from mode collapse due to its reverse-KL formulation favoring mode-seeking behavior, and existing methods to address this involve high computational costs and training instability.

Method: The authors propose a new distillation framework where the first step preserves diversity using a target-prediction approach while subsequent steps refine quality using DMD loss, with gradients blocked at the first step.

Result: DP-DMD achieves sample diversity and state-of-the-art visual quality in text-to-image generation without requiring additional networks or ground-truth images.

Conclusion: DP-DMD offers a simple and computationally efficient framework for addressing mode collapse in DMD while achieving quality generation outcomes, suitable for low-cost inference.

Abstract: Distribution matching distillation (DMD) aligns a multi-step generator with its few-step counterpart to enable high-quality generation under low inference cost. However, DMD tends to suffer from mode collapse, as its reverse-KL formulation inherently encourages mode-seeking behavior, for which existing remedies typically rely on perceptual or adversarial regularization, thereby incurring substantial computational overhead and training instability. In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALL U-KAN, the first fully KA-based deep learning model, overcoming memory and training difficulties associated with deeply stacked KANs and demonstrating superior performance for medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KAN models are limited by training challenges and high memory requirements, preventing deep explorations. This paper seeks to solve these issues and explore the potential of fully KA-based deep models.

Method: Develops Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) for better optimization and proposes Grad-Free Spline to reduce memory usage. Combines these innovations in ALL U-KAN, replacing traditional FC and Conv layers with KA and KAonv layers.

Result: Extensive evaluations on medical image segmentation tasks show ALL U-KAN achieves higher segmentation accuracy, 10x fewer parameters, and 20x lower memory consumption compared to traditional and partial KA-based models.

Conclusion: Fully KA-based architectures are viable and superior to traditional models. Their efficiency and performance open doors for further research into deep KA-based neural networks.

Abstract: Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance group activity video retrieval performance without relying on predefined activity classes or extensive annotations.

Method: It pre-trains a GAF space using self-supervised learning, updates it interactively through fine-tuning, and uses a data-efficient video selection strategy for manual labeling. Contrastive learning adjusts the GAF space based on the user's input.

Result: Experimental results on sports datasets show improved retrieval performance, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed human-in-the-loop adaptation method effectively enhances video retrieval performance, confirmed by comprehensive experiments and studies.

Abstract: This paper proposes human-in-the-loop adaptation for Group Activity Feature Learning (GAFL) without group activity annotations. This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BinaryDemoire, a framework for image demoiréing based on 1-bit binarized networks, achieving lightweight and accurate restoration of structured moiré artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high computational cost of full-precision deep networks for image demoiréing and introduces a binarization approach to reduce weight and activation bitwidths significantly.

Method: BinaryDemoire incorporates (1) moiré-aware binary gate to predict channel-wise coefficients for binary convolution aggregation and (2) shuffle-grouped residual adapter for sparse shortcut alignment and channel mixing.

Result: BinaryDemoire demonstrates superior performance compared to existing binarization methods across four benchmarks for image demoiréing.

Conclusion: BinaryDemoire offers an efficient and effective solution for structured moiré artifact removal, showcasing potential for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Image demoiréing aims to remove structured moiré artifacts in recaptured imagery, where degradations are highly frequency-dependent and vary across scales and directions. While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoiréing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BinaryDemoire.

Method: The paper proposes LSGQuant, which includes a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) for video token activations, a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) to estimate layer sensitivity, and Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized and high-precision branches.

Result: Experiments show that LSGQuant achieves performance nearly equal to the original full-precision model and surpasses existing quantization techniques.

Conclusion: The introduction of LSGQuant effectively addresses challenges with diffusion model size and computation, demonstrating significant improvements while maintaining high performance in video super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: One-Step Diffusion Models have demonstrated promising capability and fast inference in video super-resolution (VSR) for real-world. Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch.

*Minghang Zhu,Zhijing Wang,Yuxin Guo,Wen Li,Sheng Ao,Cheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempLoc, a robust LiDAR relocalization framework that integrates sequential consistency to improve global pose estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regression-based LiDAR relocalization methods struggle with dynamic or ambiguous scenarios due to reliance on single-frame inference and lack of spatio-temporal consistency across scans.

Method: TempLoc integrates three modules: Global Coordinate Estimation predicting point-wise global coordinates and uncertainties, Prior Coordinate Generation estimating inter-frame point correspondences with attention mechanisms, and Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion for end-to-end integration and temporal consistency.

Result: Experimental results on NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks demonstrate TempLoc's significant improvements in localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Temploc effectively models temporal-aware correspondence, enhancing robustness and accuracy in LiDAR relocalization.

Abstract: LiDAR relocalization aims to estimate the global 6-DoF pose of a sensor in the environment. However, existing regression-based approaches are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios, as they either solely rely on single-frame inference or neglect the spatio-temporal consistency across scans. In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose. Experimental results on the NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks show that our TempLoc outperforms stateof-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal-aware correspondence modeling in LiDAR relocalization. Our code will be released soon.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods which reconstruct isolated hands without considering the dynamic 3D environment, thus failing to fully understand physical interactions.

Method: Hand3R integrates a pre-trained hand model with a 4D scene model using a scene-aware visual prompt, injecting accurate hand priors into a persistent scene memory during a single forward pass from monocular video.

Result: Hand3R achieves competitive results in both local hand reconstruction and situating hands globally, without relying on offline optimization.

Conclusion: Hand3R advances embodied AI by providing an innovative online solution for joint hand-scene understanding, essential for capturing physical interactions in 3D.

Abstract: For Embodied AI, jointly reconstructing dynamic hands and the dense scene context is crucial for understanding physical interaction. However, most existing methods recover isolated hands in local coordinates, overlooking the surrounding 3D environment. To address this, we present Hand3R, the first online framework for joint 4D hand-scene reconstruction from monocular video. Hand3R synergizes a pre-trained hand expert with a 4D scene foundation model via a scene-aware visual prompting mechanism. By injecting high-fidelity hand priors into a persistent scene memory, our approach enables simultaneous reconstruction of accurate hand meshes and dense metric-scale scene geometry in a single forward pass. Experiments demonstrate that Hand3R bypasses the reliance on offline optimization and delivers competitive performance in both local hand reconstruction and global positioning.

### [193] [ConsisDrive: Identity-Preserving Driving World Models for Video Generation by Instance Mask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03213)
*Zhuoran Yang,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConsisDrive introduces a new world model for driving videos that preserves object identities across frames, addressing the issue of identity drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the quality and consistency of synthetic driving videos for autonomous driving tasks, as current world models face identity drift issues.

Method: ConsisDrive integrates Instance-Masked Attention and Instance-Masked Loss techniques to enhance temporal consistency and reduce background noise.

Result: ConsisDrive shows superior video generation quality and improves autonomous driving task performance on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed ConsisDrive framework effectively resolves identity drift problems, advancing synthetic driving video generation and autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on large-scale, high-quality multi-view driving videos. Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

*Guijie Wang,Tong Lin,Yifan Bai,Anjia Cao,Shiyi Liang,Wangbo Zhao,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FARTrack is a visual tracking framework focusing on improving inference speed and tracking performance for resource-constrained devices through efficient model distillation and autoregressive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow processing speeds hinder the deployment of high-performance visual trackers on devices with limited resources.

Method: FARTrack utilizes Task-Specific Self-Distillation to compress models efficiently and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification to optimize token redundancy, ensuring fast and accurate visual tracking.

Result: FARTrack achieves an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k, with speeds of up to 343 FPS on GPU and 121 FPS on CPU.

Conclusion: FARTrack successfully combines high tracking performance with fast inference speeds, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Inference speed and tracking performance are two critical evaluation metrics in the field of visual tracking. However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU.

### [195] [PokeFusion Attention: Enhancing Reference-Free Style-Conditioned Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03220)
*Jingbang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PokeFusion Attention, a method for reference-free, style-conditioned character generation in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing challenges of style drift, geometric inconsistency, and reliance on external images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with under-specified visual styles and inconsistencies in character structure when relying solely on text prompting, or they require reference images which complicate deployment.

Method: PokeFusion Attention introduces a decoder-level cross-attention mechanism that fuses text semantics with learned style embeddings directly in the diffusion decoder. It decouples text and style conditioning while freezing the pretrained backbone and trains only lightweight modules for parameter efficiency.

Result: The proposed method improves style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency on a stylized character generation benchmark, surpassing baseline methods, while keeping overhead and inference complexity low.

Conclusion: PokeFusion Attention offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient stylized generation in diffusion models, optimizing quality and simplicity without architectural expansion or reliance on external references.

Abstract: This paper studies reference-free style-conditioned character generation in text-to-image diffusion models, where high-quality synthesis requires both stable character structure and consistent, fine-grained style expression across diverse prompts. Existing approaches primarily rely on text-only prompting, which is often under-specified for visual style and tends to produce noticeable style drift and geometric inconsistency, or introduce reference-based adapters that depend on external images at inference time, increasing architectural complexity and limiting deployment flexibility.We propose PokeFusion Attention, a lightweight decoder-level cross-attention mechanism that fuses textual semantics with learned style embeddings directly inside the diffusion decoder. By decoupling text and style conditioning at the attention level, our method enables effective reference-free stylized generation while keeping the pretrained diffusion backbone fully frozen.PokeFusion Attention trains only decoder cross-attention layers together with a compact style projection module, resulting in a parameter-efficient and plug-and-play control component that can be easily integrated into existing diffusion pipelines and transferred across different backbones.Experiments on a stylized character generation benchmark (Pokemon-style) demonstrate that our method consistently improves style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency compared with representative adapter-based baselines, while maintaining low parameter overhead and inference-time simplicity.

### [196] [Spiral RoPE: Rotate Your Rotary Positional Embeddings in the 2D Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03227)
*Haoyu Liu,Sucheng Ren,Tingyu Zhu,Peng Wang,Cihang Xie,Alan Yuille,Zeyu Zheng,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spiral RoPE, a new positional embedding method for vision transformers, addressing limitations of standard RoPE by enabling multi-directional positional encoding, which improves model performance across vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE's axial formulation limits positional encoding to horizontal and vertical directions, restricting its ability to model oblique spatial relationships in images.

Method: Spiral RoPE partitions embedding channels into groups tied to uniform directions, rotating them based on patch position projections, enabling encoding of multi-directional spatial relationships.

Result: Spiral RoPE enhances performance in classification, segmentation, and generation tasks, and attention maps show more concentrated activations and better boundary respect for objects.

Conclusion: Multi-directional positional encoding provided by Spiral RoPE improves vision transformer capabilities and highlights its importance for image-based tasks.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is the de facto positional encoding in large language models due to its ability to encode relative positions and support length extrapolation. When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers.

*Shaoyu Liu,Jianing Li,Guanghui Zhao,Yunjian Zhang,Wen Jiang,Ming Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventFlash is an efficient multimodal large language model that reduces data redundancy and accelerates inference in event-based vision while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional event-based MLLMs have limitations in processing efficiency and often neglect the spatiotemporal sparsity in event streams, leading to high computational costs. The goal is to overcome these challenges and enable efficient, high-performance processing.

Method: The paper introduces EventFlash, which utilizes spatiotemporal token sparsification. It proposes three key contributions: 1) EventMind, a diverse dataset with over 500k instructions for curriculum training, 2) a temporal aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, and 3) a sparse density-guided attention module for focusing on informative spatial regions.

Result: EventFlash delivers a 12.4x throughput improvement compared to the baseline EventFlash-Zero, supports processing of long event streams with up to 1,000 bins, and surpasses the previous limit of the 5-bin EventGPT model.

Conclusion: EventFlash demonstrates that spatiotemporal sparsity can be effectively utilized to enhance computational efficiency without compromising performance, making it a promising foundation for event-based vision tasks.

Abstract: Event-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable robust perception in high-speed and low-light scenarios, addressing key limitations of frame-based MLLMs. However, current event-based MLLMs often rely on dense image-like processing paradigms, overlooking the spatiotemporal sparsity of event streams and resulting in high computational cost. In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT. We believe EventFlash serves as an efficient foundation model for event-based vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current world models, particularly in maintaining temporal consistency and spatial accuracy in driving video generation, which are essential for training robust autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper proposes InstaDrive, which includes two main components: Instance Flow Guider for maintaining temporal consistency and identity preservation, and Spatial Geometric Aligner for enhanced spatial reasoning and occlusion modeling.

Result: InstaDrive achieves superior video generation quality and improves autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset. It also simulates challenging driving scenarios using CARLA for safety evaluation of autonomous systems.

Conclusion: InstaDrive demonstrates its ability to enhance realism and utility of driving videos for autonomous driving systems, establishing state-of-the-art performance and potential for rigorous safety tests.

Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on high-quality, large-scale multi-view driving videos. While world models offer a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, they struggle to maintain instance-level temporal consistency and spatial geometric fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose InstaDrive, a novel framework that enhances driving video realism through two key advancements: (1) Instance Flow Guider, which extracts and propagates instance features across frames to enforce temporal consistency, preserving instance identity over time. (2) Spatial Geometric Aligner, which improves spatial reasoning, ensures precise instance positioning, and explicitly models occlusion hierarchies. By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Additionally, we utilize CARLA's autopilot to procedurally and stochastically simulate rare but safety-critical driving scenarios across diverse maps and regions, enabling rigorous safety evaluation for autonomous systems.

*Ofer Idan,Dan Badur,Yosi Keller,Yoli Shavit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LaVPR, a VPR benchmark with natural-language descriptions, improving localization in challenging scenarios both through multi-modal and cross-modal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in Visual Place Recognition (VPR), specifically extreme environmental changes, perceptual aliasing, and the need for 'blind' localization from verbal descriptions for applications like emergency responses.

Method: The authors introduce LaVPR, a dataset with over 650,000 natural-language descriptions, and explore Multi-Modal Fusion (visual + language) and Cross-Modal Retrieval for combining vision and language in localization systems.

Result: The integration of language improves performance consistently in visually degraded scenarios, with smaller vision backbones benefiting the most. A new baseline is established for cross-modal retrieval with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, outperforming older methods.

Conclusion: LaVPR enables robust and practical localization systems, facilitating both enhanced robustness across difficult conditions and resource-efficient deployment. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) often fails under extreme environmental changes and perceptual aliasing. Furthermore, standard systems cannot perform "blind" localization from verbal descriptions alone, a capability needed for applications such as emergency response. To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models. Ultimately, LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Sebastian Doerrich,Jonas Alle,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores hyperbolic representation learning in medical image analysis, showing generalization limits of current approaches and proposes a hyperbolic method that improves domain-invariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces challenges of limited data availability and covariate shifts across diverse conditions, limiting performance and adoption of deep neural networks.

Method: It uses hyperbolic manifolds for complex data representation and introduces an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint.

Result: Improvements of an average +2.1% AUC were observed compared to Euclidean methods across three major benchmarks, validating domain-generalization capabilities of the approach.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic approaches outperform existing Euclidean methods in achieving robust generalization for medical datasets, enhancing applicability across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Robust generalization beyond training distributions remains a critical challenge for deep neural networks. This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions.

### [201] [Global Geometry Is Not Enough for Vision Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03282)
*Jiwan Chung,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of using global embedding geometry as a measure of representational competence in vision encoders, finding it insufficient for predicting compositional binding and promoting functional sensitivity as an alternative metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning approaches rely on global embedding geometry, assuming it aligns with robust representations. However, this assumption neglects compositional structures in data.

Method: The paper tests geometric metrics for compositional binding prediction across 21 vision encoders and compares results using functional sensitivity metrics like the input-output Jacobian.

Result: Global geometry metrics correlate poorly with compositional binding. Functional sensitivity, measured by the Jacobian, is shown to effectively track compositional binding capabilities.

Conclusion: Global embedding geometry provides an incomplete picture of representational competence. Functional sensitivity should complement embedding geometry for better modeling of composite structure.

Abstract: A common assumption in representation learning is that globally well-distributed embeddings support robust and generalizable representations. This focus has shaped both training objectives and evaluation protocols, implicitly treating global geometry as a proxy for representational competence. While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure.

### [202] [A3-TTA: Adaptive Anchor Alignment Test-Time Adaptation for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03292)
*Jianghao Wu,Xiangde Luo,Yubo Zhou,Lianming Wu,Guotai Wang,Shaoting Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes A3-TTA, a Test-Time Adaptation framework to address domain shift in image segmentation models using anchor-guided pseudo-labels, significantly outperforming existing methods in performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of domain shifts in image segmentation tasks without accessing source data or retraining models.

Method: Develops the A3-TTA framework using anchor-guided supervision to create reliable pseudo-labels, enhanced by semantic consistency, boundary-aware entropy minimization, and a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to stabilize adaptation.

Result: Demonstrated significant improvements in segmentation performance, with Dice score improvements of 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points. Also excelled in continual TTA scenarios with anti-forgetting ability.

Conclusion: A3-TTA provides a stable, efficient, and robust solution for Test-Time Adaptation, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods in diverse imaging tasks. Code availability further ensures reproducibility and broader use.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a practical solution for deploying image segmentation models under domain shift without accessing source data or retraining. Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/A3-TTA.

The paper proposes and details the algorithmic design choices and the hardware-software co-optimization approach, and presents real-time performance on resource-constrained hardware. LEVIO is validated on a parallel-processing ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, achieving 20 FPS while consuming less than 100 mW, and benchmarked against public VIO datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and adoption, the complete implementation is released as open-source.

Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency. FOCUS automates the image-to-diagnosis pipeline, representing a critical advance towards unmanned ophthalmology with a validated blueprint for autonomous screening to enhance population scale retinal care accessibility and efficiency.

Conclusion: PQT-Net demonstrates high potential for precise and reliable defect characterization in additively manufactured components, offering advancement in non-destructive testing technologies.

Abstract: Defect depth quantification in additively manufactured (AM) components remains a significant challenge for non-destructive testing (NDT). This study proposes a Pixel-wise Quantitative Thermography Neural Network (PQT-Net) to address this challenge for polylactic acid (PLA) parts. A key innovation is a novel data augmentation strategy that reconstructs thermal sequence data into two-dimensional stripe images, preserving the complete temporal evolution of heat diffusion for each pixel.

Comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of PQT-Net over other deep learning models, achieving a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0094 mm and a coefficient of determination (R) exceeding 99%. The high precision of PQT-Net underscores its potential for robust quantitative defect characterization in AM.

*Ting Xiang,Jinhui Zhao,Changjian Chen,Zhuo Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerability of generative data augmentation to clean-label backdoor attacks and proposes InvLBA, a latent-level perturbation method that significantly improves attack success rates while maintaining clean label accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative data augmentation is vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks in practical applications, which can bypass human inspection. Existing pixel-level attack methods show low success rates when applied to generated images.

Method: The authors introduced InvLBA, a latent feature-level backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation. Theoretical analysis and proven generalization ensure high clean accuracy and attack success rates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate InvLBA improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with minimal reduction in clean accuracy and strong robustness against state-of-the-art defense methods.

Conclusion: The proposed latent-level attack method, InvLBA, offers a powerful, invisible threat to generative data augmentation, emphasizing the need for increased security measures in AI training workflows.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generative models, generative data augmentation has become an effective way to enrich training images, especially when only small-scale datasets are available. At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods.

Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

### [208] [PWAVEP: Purifying Imperceptible Adversarial Perturbations in 3D Point Clouds via Spectral Graph Wavelets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03333)
*Haoran Li,Renyang Liu,Hongjia Liu,Chen Wang,Long Yin,Jian Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PWAVEP, a defense framework against adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds, focusing on spectral domain analysis to remove perturbations and enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defending 3D point cloud models from adversarial attacks is challenging due to the spatial imperceptibility of the attacks and the limitations of current defensive approaches, like invasive changes and high computational expense.

Method: The authors propose PWAVEP, which calculates saliency and sparsity scores in the spectral graph wavelet domain to rank points by adversarial salience. It then uses a two-step strategy: removing highly salient adversarial outliers and applying spectral filtering to moderately salient points.

Result: PWAVEP demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods, effectively countering adversarial attacks on 3D point cloud models.

Conclusion: The proposed PWAVEP framework provides a state-of-the-art solution for 3D point cloud purification, offering plug-and-play functionality without invasive model modifications and achieving high defense performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds, particularly in achieving spatial imperceptibility and high attack performance, presents significant challenges for defenders. Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

*Bingchen Zhao,Qiushan Guo,Ye Wang,Yixuan Huang,Zhonghua Zhai,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompTok is a framework for visual tokenizers that enhances compositionality and enables semantic image editing by swapping token subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual tokenization for compositional control over image generation while ensuring semantic editing capabilities.

Method: CompTok employs a token-conditioned diffusion decoder alongside InfoGAN-style objectives and an adversarial flow regularizer to enhance compositionality and maintain natural-image distributions.

Result: CompTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in image class-conditioned generation and improves compositional token metrics for generator training.

Conclusion: CompTok successfully enhances compositionality in visual tokenization while facilitating robust semantic image editing and generation capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce CompTok, a training framework for learning visual tokenizers whose tokens are enhanced for compositionality. CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.

### [210] [QVLA: Not All Channels Are Equal in Vision-Language-Action Model's Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03782)
*Yuhao Xu,Yantai Yang,Zhenyang Fan,Yufan Liu,Yuming Li,Bing Li,Zhipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces QVLA, a novel quantization framework designed for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in robotics, achieving better compression and performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current large-scale VLA models which are not optimized for resource-constrained robotic applications due to their computational demands.

Method: Introduces QVLA, a channel-wise bit allocation quantization framework measuring action-space sensitivity for optimal bit-width assignment, combining quantization and pruning into a cohesive process.

Result: QVLA reduces VRAM usage to 29.2% of the original model, maintains 98.9% performance, achieves 1.49x speedup, and improves performance by 22.6% compared to SmoothQuant.

Conclusion: QVLA provides a robust solution for compressing VLA models, enabling their deployment on real-world hardware by preserving performance despite high compression.

Abstract: The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released.

### [211] [Tiled Prompts: Overcoming Prompt Underspecification in Image and Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03342)
*Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jonghyun Park,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tiled Prompts framework improves image and video super-resolution by creating tile-specific prompts for latent tiles instead of relying on a single global prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of single global text prompts in super-resolution algorithms, including prompt underspecification and misguidance.

Method: The study introduces Tiled Prompts, generating localized prompts specific to each tile during latent tiling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved perceptual quality, better text alignment, and reduced hallucinations and artifacts compared to global-prompt approaches.

Conclusion: Using locally text-conditioned prompts enables more accurate and high-quality super-resolution with minimal added complexity.

Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have advanced image and video super-resolution by using prompts as semantic priors, but modern super-resolution pipelines typically rely on latent tiling to scale to high resolutions, where a single global caption causes prompt underspecification. A coarse global prompt often misses localized details (prompt sparsity) and provides locally irrelevant guidance (prompt misguidance) that can be amplified by classifier-free guidance. We propose Tiled Prompts, a unified framework for image and video super-resolution that generates a tile-specific prompt for each latent tile and performs super-resolution under locally text-conditioned posteriors, providing high-information guidance that resolves prompt underspecification with minimal overhead. Experiments on high resolution real-world images and videos show consistent gains in perceptual quality and text alignment, while reducing hallucinations and tile-level artifacts relative to global-prompt baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a discrete diffusion framework for HMER, refining symbols iteratively to improve structural consistency and eliminate causal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) while overcoming issues like exposure bias and syntactic inconsistency inherent in autoregressive models.

Method: The discrete diffusion framework reformulates HMER as symbolic refinement rather than sequential generation, utilizing multi-step remasking, symbol-aware tokenization, and Random-Masking Mutual Learning.

Result: The framework achieves notable performance (5.56% CER and 60.42% EM on the MathWriting benchmark) and consistent improvements on CROHME datasets across multiple years.

Conclusion: The discrete diffusion framework presents a promising approach to structure-aware visual recognition, advancing beyond the capabilities of traditional generative modeling.

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) requires reasoning over diverse symbols and 2D structural layouts, yet autoregressive models struggle with exposure bias and syntactic inconsistency. We present a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates HMER as iterative symbolic refinement instead of sequential generation. Through multi-step remasking, the proposal progressively refines both symbols and structural relations, removing causal dependencies and improving structural consistency. A symbol-aware tokenization and Random-Masking Mutual Learning further enhance syntactic alignment and robustness to handwriting diversity. On the MathWriting benchmark, the proposal achieves 5.56\% CER and 60.42\% EM, outperforming strong Transformer and commercial baselines. Consistent gains on CROHME 2014--2023 demonstrate that discrete diffusion provides a new paradigm for structure-aware visual recognition beyond generative modeling.

### [214] [Multi-Resolution Alignment for Voxel Sparsity in Camera-Based 3D Semantic Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03371)
*Zhiwen Yang,Yuxin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA) approach for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion to overcome the voxel sparsity problem in autonomous driving scenarios by aligning multi-resolution features at scene and instance levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems face the challenge of voxel sparsity in autonomous driving scenarios, as many voxels are empty, which reduces optimization efficiency and model performance.

Method: The method introduces a Multi-resolution View Transformer to align multi-resolution 3D features at the scene level, a Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module for instance-level semantic assessment, and a Critical Distribution Alignment module to ensure feature distribution consistency across resolutions.

Result: The proposed MRA approach alleviates voxel sparsity issues by introducing auxiliary supervision mechanisms at different levels, demonstrating enhanced model performance in camera-based 3D scene completion.

Conclusion: The MRA method effectively improves voxel-level perception in 3D semantic scene completion by addressing the sparsity issue, leading to better optimization and performance in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) offers a cost-effective solution for assessing the geometric occupancy and semantic labels of each voxel in the surrounding 3D scene with image inputs, providing a voxel-level scene perception foundation for the perception-prediction-planning autonomous driving systems. Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLIM-Diff, a joint diffusion model for lesion generation in epilepsy FLAIR MRI data, addressing modeling challenges with compact components and loss geometry tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in the generation of subtle and scarce FCD lesion representations in epilepsy FLAIR MRI, which are prone to instability and model memorization.

Method: SLIM-Diff employs a shared-bottleneck U-Net for tight coupling between anatomical and lesion features, using a 2-channel image-mask input and introducing tunable loss geometry with fractional penalties.

Result: SLIM-Diff demonstrates that $x_0$-prediction outperforms alternatives for joint synthesis. Fractional $L_{1.5}$ penalties improve image fidelity, while $L_2$ penalties preserve lesion mask morphology.

Conclusion: SLIM-Diff provides a compact and effective joint generative framework for handling FCD lesion modeling with improved image and mask synthesis trade-offs.

Abstract: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) lesions in epilepsy FLAIR MRI are subtle and scarce, making joint image--mask generative modeling prone to instability and memorization. We propose SLIM-Diff, a compact joint diffusion model whose main contributions are (i) a single shared-bottleneck U-Net that enforces tight coupling between anatomy and lesion geometry from a 2-channel image+mask representation, and (ii) loss-geometry tuning via a tunable $L_p$ objective. As an internal baseline, we include the canonical DDPM-style objective ($ε$-prediction with $L_2$ loss) and isolate the effect of prediction parameterization and $L_p$ geometry under a matched setup. Experiments show that $x_0$-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis, and that fractional sub-quadratic penalties ($L_{1.5}$) improve image fidelity while $L_2$ better preserves lesion mask morphology.

*Jiale Meng,Runyi Hu,Jie Zhang,Zheming Lu,Ivor Tsang,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiM, a multi-dimensional watermarking framework that unifies methods at a functional level through dimension-aware mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify existing watermarking methods and explore how dimensionality of payload impacts functional behavior.

Method: Introduce a framework (DiM) modeling watermark as payloads with varying dimensional configurations (binary, spatial, spatiotemporal).

Result: DiM enables distinct watermarking behaviors like tamper localization, fine control, and order recovery by altering embedding and extraction dimensions.

Conclusion: Dimensional configurations in watermarking significantly influence its capabilities without requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Deep watermarking methods often share similar encoder-decoder architectures, yet differ substantially in their functional behaviors. We propose DiM, a new multi-dimensional watermarking framework that formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, thereby unifying existing watermarking methods at the functional level. Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the issue of hallucinations in multimodal reasoning models and proposes C3PO, a framework combining reasoning compression and contrastive preference optimization to effectively mitigate them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning models due to overreliance on language priors and inadequate visual input.

Method: The method involves two components: Chain-of-Thought Compression to filter redundant tokens for efficient representation and Contrastive Preference Optimization to train on high-quality reasoning traces using informative negative signals.

Result: C3PO consistently reduces hallucinations across various multimodal reasoning models and benchmarks, supported by experimental analysis and theoretical insights.

Conclusion: C3PO enhances multimodal reasoning models by mitigating hallucination, improving their reliability and performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While multimodal reasoning models (MLRMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities, they remain prone to hallucinations, and effective solutions are still underexplored. In this paper, we experimentally analyze the hallucination cause and propose C3PO, a training-based mitigation framework comprising \textbf{C}hain-of-Thought \textbf{C}ompression and \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization. Firstly, we identify that introducing reasoning mechanisms exacerbates models' reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, which can produce CoTs with reduced visual cues but redundant text tokens. To this end, we propose to selectively filter redundant thinking tokens for a more compact and signal-efficient CoT representation that preserves task-relevant information while suppressing noise. In addition, we observe that the quality of the reasoning trace largely determines whether hallucination emerges in subsequent responses. To leverage this insight, we introduce a reasoning-enhanced preference tuning scheme that constructs training pairs using high-quality AI feedback. We further design a multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism that elicits models' inherent hallucination patterns via carefully crafted inducers, yielding informative negative signals for contrastive correction. We provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness and demonstrate consistent hallucination reduction across diverse MLRMs and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in unsupervised object-centric learning, focusing on improving encoder-decoder interactions through Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) to achieve better object decomposition in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fundamental conflict in slot-based architectures between the encoder's sharp, high-frequency attention maps and the decoder's blurry reconstruction maps, which hinders effective unsupervised learning.

Method: The proposed SRL method utilizes mutual refinement between the encoder and decoder, leveraging the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary of decoder outputs, and the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise encoder features. It is stabilized via a warm-up phase using a slot regularization objective.

Result: The SRL method achieves state-of-the-art performance on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mutually refining encoder and decoder representations resolves the representational gap and enhances scene decomposition capabilities in unsupervised object learning architectures.

Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning models, particularly slot-based architectures, have shown great promise in decomposing complex scenes. However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UnHype, a hypernetwork-based approach for scalable and efficient selective unlearning in diffusion models, addressing the limitations of current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over the misuse of large-scale diffusion models in generating harmful content motivated the search for effective machine unlearning methods that preserve general generative capabilities.

Method: The authors propose UnHype, which integrates hypernetworks with LoRA training to enable context-aware and scalable selective unlearning in single- and multi-concept scenarios.

Result: UnHype demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control across challenging tasks like object, celebrity, and explicit content erasure, showing versatility.

Conclusion: UnHype offers a robust and scalable solution for achieving targeted selective unlearning in diffusion models while maintaining generative quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

TL;DR: Socratic-Geo introduces a new framework to model geometric reasoning in multimodal AI by coupling dynamic data synthesis and learning, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric reasoning is a critical challenge in vision-language understanding due to the lack of high-quality image-text pairs. Existing methods face issues of inefficiency, high costs, and data fidelity.

Method: The proposed Socratic-Geo uses a multi-agent interaction framework where a Teacher agent generates Python scripts verified for solvability and visual validity, while a Solver agent refines reasoning based on feedback. A Generator agent further enhances image generation via programmatic intelligence.

Result: Socratic-Solver attained 49.11 across six benchmarks, outperforming baselines by 2.43 points using one-fourth the typical data. Socratic-Generator scored 42.4% on GenExam, surpassing existing state-of-the-art open-source models.

Conclusion: Socratic-Geo successfully boosts geometric reasoning performance and data efficiency, setting new benchmarks in MLLMs, showcasing promise for broader applications in vision-language AI.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced vision-language understanding. However, even state-of-the-art models struggle with geometric reasoning, revealing a critical bottleneck: the extreme scarcity of high-quality image-text pairs. Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated "image-code-instruction" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%).

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConsistentRFT, a framework to mitigate visual hallucinations in flow-based models undergoing Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), with significant improvements in performance and alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address visual hallucinations in flow-based models during Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, which cause over-optimized details and semantic misalignment negatively affecting model preference alignment.

Method: The authors propose ConsistentRFT, incorporating two main components: Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) for better exploration and Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) for enhanced exploitation alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate reductions in visual hallucinations by 49% (low-level) and 38% (high-level) perceptual measures. Out-of-domain metrics improved significantly by 5.1% compared to a baseline.

Conclusion: ConsistentRFT effectively reduces visual hallucinations and improves cross-domain model performance, establishing a practical approach for better preference alignment in flow-based models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior.

### [222] [Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance for Multi-Subject Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03448)
*Yijia Xu,Zihao Wang,Jinshi Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), for generating images of multiple subjects with better identity consistency and compositional control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-subject image generation often fail in terms of identity consistency and compositional accuracy due to their reliance on implicit associations between text prompts and reference images.

Method: The proposed method, CAG, uses a hierarchical structure: 1) A VAE dropout strategy at the concept level to encourage reliance on semantic signals from Visual Language Models (VLM). 2) A correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to enforce text-token-to-region binding.

Result: CAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-subject image generation by significantly enhancing identity preservation and adherence to textual instructions.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective solution for consistent and precise multi-subject image generation, addressing the limitations of prior approaches and advancing the field.

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency.

*Yeongtak Oh,Sangwon Yu,Junsung Park,Han Cheol Moon,Jisoo Mok,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current vision-language models fail in providing personalized responses linked to individual experiences. CoViP is introduced to address this with reinforcement learning and diagnostic evaluations, showing superior results in personal image captioning and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of vision-language models failing to align visual inputs with user-specific accumulated visual-textual context, thereby enabling personalized experiences.

Method: Proposes CoViP, focusing on personalized image captioning through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation, along with specific diagnostic evaluations to enhance reliability.

Result: CoViP demonstrates superior performance in personalized image captioning and shows significant improvements across other downstream personalization tasks.

Conclusion: CoViP marks a critical advancement in contextualized visual personalization by providing robust and generalizable solutions for integrating visual and textual contexts.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization.

### [224] [Inlier-Centric Post-Training Quantization for Object Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03472)
*Minsu Kim,Dongyeun Lee,Jaemyung Yu,Jiwan Hur,Giseop Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InlierQ introduces a post-training quantization method to distinguish and suppress task-irrelevant anomalies, improving object detection by preserving informative features while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high computational demands in object detection and the adverse effects of anomalies (task-irrelevant activations) that complicate effective quantization.

Method: InlierQ uses gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies anomalies through Expectation-Maximization algorithm, and separates anomalies from inliers post-training while requiring only 64 calibration samples.

Result: Experiments on COCO and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrated consistent reductions in quantization errors across 2D and 3D object detection tasks using cameras and LiDAR.

Conclusion: InlierQ effectively improves post-training quantization by reducing task-irrelevant anomalies and preserving crucial features, offering a practical, computationally efficient solution for object detection.

Abstract: Object detection is pivotal in computer vision, yet its immense computational demands make deployment slow and power-hungry, motivating quantization. However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection.

*Yingjie Zhu,Xuefeng Bai,Kehai Chen,Yang Xiang,Youcheng Pan,Xiaoqiang Zhou,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to adapt Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for reasoning over table images without requiring extensive annotations or external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenge of enabling LVLMs to reason over complex table structures and layouts efficiently and without relying on time-consuming supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external resources.

Method: The authors introduce DiSCo, which disentangles structure from content for alignment, and Table-GLS, a reasoning framework that uses structured exploration and evidence-based inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant enhancement in LVLMs for table reasoning, enabling them to generalize to unseen table structures.

Conclusion: The approach improves efficiency, scalability, and table reasoning of LVLMs while reducing dependency on annotations and external tools.

Abstract: Reasoning over table images remains challenging for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to complex layouts and tightly coupled structure-content information. Existing solutions often depend on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability. This work addresses a key question: how to adapt LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools? Specifically, we first introduce DiSCo, a Disentangled Structure-Content alignment framework that explicitly separates structural abstraction from semantic grounding during multimodal alignment, efficiently adapting LVLMs to tables structures. Building on DiSCo, we further present Table-GLS, a Global-to-Local Structure-guided reasoning framework that performs table reasoning via structured exploration and evidence-grounded inference. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework efficiently enhances LVLM's table understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly generalizing to unseen table structures.

*Bozhou Li,Yushuo Guan,Haolin Li,Bohan Zeng,Yiyan Ji,Yue Ding,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Yuanxing Zhang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves text-to-image generation by introducing a framework that dynamically integrates LLM layer features through depth-wise and time-wise strategies, revealing that depth-wise fusion is the most effective method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current DiT-based text-to-image models which adopt static text conditioning and mainly use a single LLM layer, despite the hierarchical LLM semantic structure and dynamic diffusion processes.

Method: The authors propose a unified normalized convex fusion framework with lightweight gates to organize multi-layer LLM hidden states using time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion strategies.

Result: Depth-wise Semantic Routing emerges as the best approach, significantly improving text-image alignment and compositional generation performance, while time-wise fusion negatively impacts visual fidelity due to train-inference mismatches.

Conclusion: Depth-wise routing is validated as an effective method for text conditioning, underlining the importance of trajectory-aware signals for improving time-dependent conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent DiT-based text-to-image models increasingly adopt LLMs as text encoders, yet text conditioning remains largely static and often utilizes only a single LLM layer, despite pronounced semantic hierarchy across LLM layers and non-stationary denoising dynamics over both diffusion time and network depth. To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes InteractAvatar, a framework tackling the challenge of generating talking avatars engaged in grounded human-object interactions, offering enhanced control and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generating talking avatars that perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects because of challenges in environmental perception and balancing motion control with video quality.

Method: The authors introduce InteractAvatar, a dual-stream framework decoupling environmental perception and planning (via a Perception and Interaction Module - PIM) from video synthesis. This includes an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) and a motion-to-video aligner for synchronized co-generation of interactions and videos.

Result: The framework successfully generates talking avatars engaging in realistic, text-aligned human-object interactions, validated through a newly established benchmark, GroundedInter, and extensive comparative experiments.

Conclusion: InteractAvatar effectively overcomes challenges in GHOI generation, presents a benchmark for evaluation, and significantly improves the quality and control of videos showing grounded human-object interactions.

Abstract: Generating talking avatars is a fundamental task in video generation. Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars. Project page: https://interactavatar.github.io

*Xufei Zhang,Xinjiao Zhou,Ziling Deng,Dongdong Geng,Jianxiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Logical Anomaly Classification (LAC), introducing a vision-language framework (LogiCls) for identifying broken logical rules in industrial images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise detection of specific logical constraints violations in industrial images for better quality assurance.

Method: LogiCls framework uses a vision-language approach, decomposing logical constraints into subqueries. It includes data synthesis, chain-of-thought supervision, and difficulty-aware resampling strategies.

Result: LogiCls achieved robust and interpretable results in logical anomaly classification, offering accurate identification of violation categories and corresponding evidence.

Conclusion: LogiCls improves industrial logical anomaly classification, enabling fine-grained detection with traceable results and advancing the utility of vision-language models.

Abstract: Logical anomalies are violations of predefined constraints on object quantity, spatial layout, and compositional relationships in industrial images. While prior work largely treats anomaly detection as a binary decision, such formulations cannot indicate which logical rule is broken and therefore offer limited value for quality assurance. We introduce Logical Anomaly Classification (LAC), a task that unifies anomaly detection and fine-grained violation classification in a single inference step. To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning. Training is stabilized by a difficulty-aware resampling strategy that emphasizes challenging subqueries and long tail constraint types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both the predicted violation categories and their evidence trails.

*Yongwei Chen,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zhaoyang Lyu,Shangchen Zhou,Xudong Xu,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining autoregressive and diffusion paradigms for effective interaction between 3D understanding and generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of extending unified understanding and generation frameworks to 3D, which is hindered by signal quantization and high training costs.

Method: The framework uses autoregressive next-token prediction for 3D understanding, diffusion models for 3D generation, and a lightweight transformer for effective cross-modal interaction.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks and excels in 3D editing tasks.

Conclusion: This unified AR+diffusion model is a promising approach for advancing general-purpose 3D intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence.

*Zihan Zheng,Zhenglong Wu,Xuanxuan Wang,Houqiang Zhong,Xiaoyun Zhang,Qiang Hu,Guangtao Zhai,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS) ensures high-quality 4D dynamic scene reconstruction within strict memory constraints, achieving efficient compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of excessive memory usage or quality degradation in dynamic scene reconstruction on edge devices caused by unconstrained densification and heuristic pruning.

Method: Developed a budget-constrained optimization framework using a differentiable budget controller with a unified importance score, decoupling static and dynamic optimization, and introducing a three-phase training strategy for precise capacity enforcement.

Result: CDGS achieves over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strict hardware constraints and high-quality rendering.

Conclusion: CDGS effectively balances memory constraints and rendering quality, advancing rate-distortion performance for 4D reconstruction on edge devices.

Abstract: While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four inter-image data augmentation strategies for improving multi-organ segmentation models, demonstrating the effectiveness of CutMix, CarveMix, and AnatoMix with significant performance boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve deep learning-based multi-organ segmentation models which face challenges due to limited manually-annotated clinical data, by exploring advanced inter-image data augmentation techniques.

Method: Four inter-image data augmentation strategies (CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug, and AnatoMix) were analyzed and tested on two organ segmentation datasets to evaluate their impact on segmentation performance.

Result: The results show that CutMix, CarveMix, and AnatoMix improved the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0, and 1.9 respectively, compared to a baseline model without data augmentation. Performance was further enhanced by combining these with traditional data augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: Data augmentation, particularly the CutMix strategy, proves to be effective in enhancing the performance of multi-organ segmentation models even with limited data. The techniques and codes are made publicly available for future research.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a widely applied clinical routine and automated organ segmentation tools dramatically improve the pipeline of the radiologists. Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELIQ, a new framework for label-free quality assessment of AI-generated images that evolves alongside advancements in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing quality labels and methods in keeping up with rapidly advancing generative text-to-image models.

Method: ELIQ constructs positive and negative image pairs to account for distortions, adapts multimodal models through instruction tuning, and predicts quality using gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer.

Result: ELIQ outperforms label-free methods in benchmarks, generalizes to user-generated content, and ensures scalable quality assessment for evolving generative models.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective solution for assessing visual quality and prompt alignment without labels, applicable across evolving AI-generated content.

Abstract: Generative text-to-image models are advancing at an unprecedented pace, continuously shifting the perceptual quality ceiling and rendering previously collected labels unreliable for newer generations. To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models. The code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlowFocus, a mechanism improving video large language models (Vid-LLMs) for fine-grained video understanding by effectively balancing frame-level and video-level information, with a new benchmark called FineAction-CGR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vid-LLMs struggle to balance high-quality frame-level details and comprehensive video-level temporal information, limiting their ability for fine-grained video understanding.

Method: The proposed SlowFocus mechanism identifies query-related video segments for dense sampling and uses multi-frequency mixing attention to combine local high-frequency with global low-frequency features. New training strategies are introduced to improve temporal reasoning and grounding.

Result: SlowFocus significantly enhances Vid-LLMs’ performance in processing fine-grained video understanding tasks as demonstrated by superior results on current benchmarks and the novel FineAction-CGR.

Conclusion: The SlowFocus mechanism, along with its associated training strategies and benchmark, addresses critical limitations in Vid-LLMs, marking a step forward in fine-grained temporal video analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR.

Motivation: Existing methods for underwater object detection struggle with visual similarity between targets and backgrounds, and topology fragmentation of slender and transparent creatures.

Conclusion: DeepTopo-Net improves underwater camouflaged object detection, successfully preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns. Datasets and codes will be openly accessible.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) is a challenging task due to the extreme visual similarity between targets and backgrounds across varying marine depths. Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Specifically, we first introduce GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark tailored for marine vertical zonation, filling the data gap for hadal and abyssal zones. Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and our proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate that DeepTopo-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for zero-shot anomaly detection using a vision-language model called TIPS, improving both image-level and pixel-level detection performance without relying on complex auxiliary modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in anomaly detection where the target-domain normal data are unavailable, and improve upon limitations in CLIP, such as spatial misalignment and weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies.

Method: The method leverages TIPS, a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives, and incorporates decoupled prompts for global and local features, while injecting local evidence into global scoring.

Result: The proposed pipeline enhances image-level anomaly detection by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level localization by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets.

Conclusion: TIPS-based architecture provides strong generalization in anomaly detection with better performance and a lean design, offering an effective alternative to prior methods reliant on intricate adjustments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection identifies departures from expected behavior in safety-critical settings. When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Refer-Agent, a system to improve Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), which outperforms existing methods while being adaptable without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS relies heavily on supervised fine-tuning of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are expensive and challenging to scale. Zero-shot methods, while more flexible, underperform due to simplistic designs.

Method: Refer-Agent uses a multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection. Key innovations include Coarse-to-Fine frame selection for diverse, relevant frames, and a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism for self-verifying and refining intermediate results.

Result: Refer-Agent outperformed state-of-the-art models in five benchmarks, excelling over both fine-tuned and zero-shot approaches. It is also adaptable to new MLLMs without extra fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Refer-Agent offers a scalable improvement over current RVOS methods, combining enhanced performance with flexibility and cost-efficiency in adopting evolving MLLMs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos based on textual queries. Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs. Code will be released.

TL;DR: EB-JEPA is a library for representation learning using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures, suitable for self-supervised learning in images, videos, and action-conditioned world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to make energy-based self-supervised representation learning accessible and demonstrate its adaptability from images to video and action-conditioned models.

Method: The library uses Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures to learn in representation space, providing modular and GPU-friendly implementations for image, video, and control modeling tasks.

Result: The framework achieves 91% accuracy in probing on CIFAR-10, scales to video modeling on Moving MNIST, and reaches a 97% planning success rate in the Two Rooms task.

Conclusion: EB-JEPA showcases the versatility of JEPA-based learning for various tasks, emphasizing the role of regularization in preventing collapse. It can help advance research in representation learning and action-conditioned modeling.

Abstract: We present EB-JEPA, an open-source library for learning representations and world models using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa.

### [238] [KTV: Keyframes and Key Tokens Selection for Efficient Training-Free Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03615)
*Baiyang Song,Jun Peng,Yuxin Zhang,Guangyao Chen,Feidiao Yang,Jianyuan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes KTV, a training-free video understanding framework that reduces redundancy and computational overhead by selecting keyframes and key visual tokens for efficient processing, achieving high accuracy on benchmarks with fewer computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free methods for video understanding face challenges such as severe visual redundancy and computational overhead. Current methods rely on biased keyframe selection strategies, leading to suboptimal video comprehension.

Method: The proposed KTV framework follows a two-stage process: 1) Question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level features to reduce redundancy and maintain representation. 2) Key visual token selection to further prune redundant tokens within selected keyframes, reducing computational load for the vision language model.

Result: KTV demonstrated improved efficiency and effectiveness on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task, using significantly fewer visual tokens (e.g., 504 for a 60-minute video) while achieving 44.8% accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. It also surpassed several training-based approaches on certain datasets.

Conclusion: KTV proves to be an efficient and effective approach for training-free video understanding, overcoming redundancy and computational limitations, and achieving competitive or better results than traditional and training-based approaches.

Abstract: Training-free video understanding leverages the strong image comprehension capabilities of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by treating a video as a sequence of static frames, thus obviating the need for costly video-specific training. However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. In particular, KTV also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for retinal disease diagnosis using multimodal data synthesis and fusion, achieving significant accuracy improvements in classification and grading tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in multimodal retinal disease diagnosis, such as data heterogeneity and complexity, through an integrated and efficient framework.

Method: A unified framework is developed, synthesizing data from FFA, MSI, and saliency maps. Parallel models independently train on each modality, with features adaptively calibrated for optimal integration and task performance.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results in multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy: 0.842, Kappa: 0.861) using two public datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening and provides a scalable solution for medical imaging data augmentation.

Abstract: Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities.

*Estelle Chigot,Thomas Oberlin,Manon Huguenin,Dennis Wilson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the domain gap in semantic segmentation by using multi-objective genetic algorithms to optimize style transfer pipelines. Results show better adaptation from synthetic to real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation networks need accurate, pixel-level data annotations, which are expensive to acquire for real images. Synthetic data can alleviate this but leads to a domain gap that affects real-world performance.

Method: A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to optimize style transfer pipelines for synthetic images considering both structural coherence and style similarity. Paired-image metrics are used for quick evaluation during optimization.

Result: The method generates pipelines that improve adaptation from synthetic images to real datasets like Cityscapes and ACDC under challenging conditions. The pipelines are evaluated using distributional metrics and segmentation results.

Conclusion: The study formulates style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary algorithms and demonstrates efficient metrics for feasible optimization. This advances synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, with the source code made publicly available.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks require large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which are costly to obtain for real-world images. Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

*Wei Zhang,Xiang Liu,Ningjing Liu,Mingxin Liu,Wei Liao,Chunyan Xu,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective framework for oriented object detection in remote sensing, effectively handling sparse weakly-labeled and unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high annotation costs in oriented object detection within dense object distributions and varied categories, especially in the remote sensing domain.

Method: A Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised framework is proposed, comprising a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student model, Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering, and sparse partitioning methods.

Result: The method achieves significant performance improvements over traditional approaches in experiments conducted on DOTA and DIOR datasets.

Conclusion: Their approach successfully reduces labeling requirements while maintaining robust performance, addressing scalability challenges in oriented object detection.

Abstract: A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

TL;DR: MM-SCALE introduces a novel dataset with 5-point scalar ratings for improving multimodal moral reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) focusing on aligning with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of binary or pairwise supervision in capturing the nuanced and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning in multimodal contexts.

Method: MM-SCALE employs scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding to annotate image-scenario pairs, enabling listwise preference optimization for VLMs' moral alignment.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs using MM-SCALE improves ranking fidelity and provides more stable safety calibration compared to binary supervision methods.

Conclusion: Moving from binary signals to scalar supervision in datasets allows richer alignment and finer calibration for multimodal moral reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) continue to struggle to make morally salient judgments in multimodal and socially ambiguous contexts. Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding. Each image-scenario pair is annotated with moral acceptability scores and grounded reasoning labels by humans using an interface we tailored for data collection, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets. By moving from discrete to scalar supervision, our framework provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration of multimodal moral reasoning. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned on MM-SCALE achieve higher ranking fidelity and more stable safety calibration than those trained with binary signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection for automated vehicles is critical, especially in mixed-traffic and challenging conditions, but current methods lack robustness and efficiency, particularly in spatial-temporal correlations.

Method: The paper introduces a sequential neural network with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism within an encoder-decoder structure, leveraging large open-source datasets for training and testing.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency, with lower parameters and MACs due to spatial-temporal attention.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves lane detection for AVs by focusing on spatial-temporal correlations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIAS introduces a new paradigm for industrial anomaly detection using language guidance instead of traditional manual thresholds. It improves flexibility and precision in anomaly localization, supported by the MVTec-Ref dataset and advanced DQFormer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in industrial anomaly detection methods, including rough localization in unsupervised approaches, overfitting in supervised methods due to imbalanced data, and inefficiencies of using separate models for anomalies.

Method: RIAS leverages language-based guidance and introduces universal prompts along with the MVTec-Ref dataset for contextual anomaly detection. It proposes the DQFormer model using refined tokens and language-gated techniques for precise segmentation.

Result: The experiments demonstrate RIAS’s ability to efficiently detect diverse anomalies and improve multi-scale segmentation without relying on redundant queries, showcasing its open-set anomaly detection potential.

Conclusion: RIAS represents a shift in IAD, utilizing language for improved anomaly detection functionality and scalability. Results validate its advantages over traditional methods and its adaptability across diverse anomalies.

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is vital for manufacturing, yet traditional methods face significant challenges: unsupervised approaches yield rough localizations requiring manual thresholds, while supervised methods overfit due to scarce, imbalanced data. Both suffer from the "One Anomaly Class, One Model" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only "Anomaly" and "Background" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration. Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing IAD toward open-set capabilities. Code: https://github.com/swagger-coder/RIAS-MVTec-Ref.

TL;DR: This paper presents RegionReasoner, a framework aimed at enhancing multi-round visual reasoning by grounding reasoning traces in visual bounding boxes and maintaining global-local semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models have limitations in multi-round reasoning, as they often perform single-step or text-only reasoning, omitting iterative refinement across multiple visual contexts.

Method: RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework, introduces a reward mechanism that enforces bounding box grounding and global-local semantic consistency. It employs a new benchmark, RegionDial-Bench, for evaluating reasoning across detection and segmentation tasks.

Result: RegionReasoner-7B significantly improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency based on experiments on detection and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: RegionReasoner combined with RegionDial-Bench sets a strong baseline for iterative visual reasoning and highlights the importance of grounded, multi-round reasoning systems for future research.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have achieved remarkable progress in visual reasoning, yet most existing systems rely on single-step or text-only reasoning, limiting their ability to iteratively refine understanding across multiple visual contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment. Experiments on detection and segmentation tasks show that RegionReasoner-7B, together with our newly introduced benchmark RegionDial-Bench, considerably improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency, establishing a strong baseline for this emerging research direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic platforms can detect structural deficiencies but struggle with generating human-readable summaries from these detections on resource-limited edge devices.

Method: The pipeline integrates a lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) for defect detection and summarization, optimized with post-training quantization for edge device deployment.

Result: The proposed solution achieved 0.834 F1-score for segmentation, reduced model size and latency, and effectively generated real-time natural language summaries, validated on a mobile robotic platform.

Conclusion: This study shows the feasibility of scalable, autonomous inspection systems that bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights, enhancing infrastructure maintenance through edge-deployable AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection of underground infrastructure, such as sewer and culvert systems, is critical to public safety and urban sustainability. Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.

TL;DR: Autoregressive video models struggle with long-horizon prediction errors; LIVE introduces a cycle-consistency objective to stabilize video generation over extended periods without teacher-based distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive video models are hindered by error accumulation over long horizons, impacting their ability to predict accurate video sequences.

Method: LIVE introduces a novel cycle-consistency objective where forward rollouts and reverse reconstruction eliminate long-term error propagation using diffusion loss. Progressive training curriculum is also adopted for further stability.

Result: LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon video generation benchmarks, producing stable and high-quality videos exceeding training rollout lengths.

Conclusion: LIVE effectively resolves long-horizon error propagation issues in video world models while simplifying the training process and improving performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to transform static anime illustrations into manipulatable 2.5D models, utilizing semantic decomposition and inferred drawing orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current workflows for transforming anime illustrations into dynamic models require manual segmentation and artistic interpretation, making the process tedious and limiting automation.

Method: The approach uses semantic layer decomposition with inpainting, a scalable engine for data preprocessing from Live2D models, a Body Part Consistency Module for geometry enforcement, and a pseudo-depth inference mechanism to resolve stratification.

Result: The framework produces high-fidelity 2.5D models suitable for professional workflows and real-time animation applications.

Conclusion: This methodology allows efficient transformation of anime illustrations into manipulatable models, significantly enhancing automation and quality in professional animation workflows.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that automates the transformation of static anime illustrations into manipulatable 2.5D models. Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically analyze paleoradiology images, achieving high accuracy in identifying main bone, projection view, and laterality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in efficiently analyzing paleoradiology images, which are often heterogeneous and difficult to navigate due to variations in positioning, age of bones, and absence of laterality markers.

Method: A zero-shot prompting strategy with a state-of-the-art LVLM is employed to identify key features of paleoradiology images. The pipeline converts DICOM files to PNGs, processes them with LVLM prompts, and outputs structured data for validation.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated 92% accuracy in identifying the main bone, 80% accuracy for projection view, and 100% for laterality, based on expert evaluations of 100 random images.

Conclusion: The use of LVLMs can significantly improve the efficiency of analyzing large paleoradiology datasets, supporting advancements in anthropology workflows.

Abstract: Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate REPA-G’s ability to generate high-quality, diverse outputs with fine-grained and semantic control of generation.

Conclusion: REPA-G enables flexible and precise conditioning during inference for diffusion models, expanding the capabilities beyond traditional approaches, supported by theoretical justification and quantitative evidence.

Abstract: While representation alignment with self-supervised models has been shown to improve diffusion model training, its potential for enhancing inference-time conditioning remains largely unexplored. We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations. Code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/REPA-G.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents RAWDet-7, a dataset of annotated RAW images enabling studies on object detection, description, and image processing under low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision models use RGB images optimized for human perception, losing valuable sensor-level data for machine analysis. The motivation is to enable exploration of RAW images which retain unprocessed information.

Method: The authors created RAWDet-7, a large-scale RAW image dataset with ~25k training and 7.6k test images, annotated for object categories. They incorporate object-level descriptions and simulate 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization for analysis.

Result: RAWDet-7 enriches research on object detection and image description under low-bit RAW processing, facilitating evaluations of performance, information detail, and generalization under sensor constraints.

Conclusion: By introducing RAWDet-7, the study bridges the gap in sensor-level image analysis, enabling advancements in object detection and RAW image description research.

Abstract: Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift from preoperative MRI during temporal lobe resection surgeries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain shift during neurosurgery invalidates preoperative MRI, requiring solutions to enhance neuronavigation systems' precision using intraoperative brain shift compensation.

Method: Using a U-Net-based model, NeuralShift predicts brain shift solely from preoperative MRI. Evaluation was conducted via TREs and DICE scores comparing predicted versus intraoperative masks.

Result: NeuralShift achieved high prediction accuracy—DICE score of 0.97 and TRE as low as 1.12 mm for local displacements—effectively compensating for brain shifts in temporal lobe neurosurgery.

Conclusion: NeuralShift has potential to improve safety, efficiency, and surgical outcomes in neurosurgery by accurately predicting brain deformation using preoperative imaging alone.

Abstract: Introduction: In neurosurgery, image-guided Neurosurgery Systems (IGNS) highly rely on preoperative brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) to assist surgeons in locating surgical targets and determining surgical paths. However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients. Our contributions will be publicly available after acceptance in https://github.com/SurgicalDataScienceKCL/NeuralShift.

### [253] [3D-Aware Implicit Motion Control for View-Adaptive Human Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03796)
*Zhixue Fang,Xu He,Songlin Tang,Haoxian Zhang,Qingfeng Li,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 3DiMo, a novel approach to human motion control in video generation that avoids limitations from 2D poses and explicit 3D parametric models, leveraging implicit, view-agnostic motion representation within a pretrained video generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for human motion control struggle with limitations of 2D poses (viewpoint rigidity) and explicit 3D models (inherent inaccuracies like depth ambiguity). The paper aims to explore a solution that aligns naturally with video generator's spatial priors while enabling novel-view synthesis.

Method: 3DiMo is proposed, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator. It distills driving frames into view-agnostic motion tokens using cross-attention. Training uses view-rich supervision (single-view, multi-view videos) and auxiliary geometric supervision, relying on SMPL only for early initialization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that 3DiMo achieves superior performance in reproducing driving motions with better motion fidelity and visual quality, along with flexible text-driven camera control.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the constraints of existing techniques, enabling 3D-aware motion control with improved synthesis accuracy and dynamic viewpoint flexibility in video generation.

Abstract: Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.

### [254] [Progressive Checkerboards for Autoregressive Multiscale Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03811)
*David Eigen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient parallel sampling method for autoregressive image generation using progressive checkerboards in a multiscale structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to efficiently sample independent image locations in parallel while preserving dependencies between them in autoregressive image generation.

Method: The method leverages progressive checkerboards to maintain balanced sampling in multiscale quadtree subdivisions, enabling both parallel and conditional processing.

Result: The proposed method shows competitive performance on ImageNet with fewer sampling steps compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems.

Conclusion: Autoregressive image generation can be improved with a balanced multiscale ordering approach, reducing the required sampling steps without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: A key challenge in autoregressive image generation is to efficiently sample independent locations in parallel, while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning. Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps.

*Dingkun Zhang,Shuhan Qi,Yulin Wu,Xinyu Xiao,Xuan Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualSpeed introduces a framework to address inefficiency in Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) training by reducing visual tokens and ensuring consistent performance between training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in MLLM training caused by large model sizes and excessive visual tokens, and improve training speed without sacrificing performance.

Method: DualSpeed uses a dual-mode framework: a fast-mode implements Visual Token Pruning (VTP) for reduced visual tokens and a slow-mode handles full visual sequences to ensure training-inference consistency. Self-distillation aids the slower mode by learning from the faster mode.

Result: DualSpeed achieves a training speed improvement of 2.1× for LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0× for LLaVA-NeXT, while maintaining over 99% of the models' performance.

Conclusion: DualSpeed provides an effective solution for accelerating MLLM training by combining token pruning and full-sequence training while retaining substantial model performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from severe training inefficiency issue, which is associated with their massive model sizes and visual token numbers. Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\times$, retaining over 99% performance. Code: https://github.com/dingkun-zhang/DualSpeed

### [256] [Continuous Control of Editing Models via Adaptive-Origin Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03826)
*Alon Wolf,Chen Katzir,Kfir Aberman,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of smooth control in text-guided edits within diffusion-based editing models, proposing Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr) to enhance edit intensity control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based editing models are powerful for semantic edits but struggle with smoothly controlling text-guided edits' intensity, leading to issues in edit consistency.

Method: The authors propose AdaOr, a method incorporating identity-conditioned adaptive origins blended with standard predictions, to create smooth edit transitions and better control during inference.

Result: Experiments on image and video editing show AdaOr offers smoother, more consistent control compared to traditional slider-based editing methods.

Conclusion: AdaOr integrates identity instructions into standard training, enabling precise edit control without specialized datasets or additional procedures.

Abstract: Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current event-based 3D reconstruction methods lack accuracy, with dense 3D mesh reconstruction being underexplored.

Method: EventNeuS combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based data. It incorporates spherical harmonics encodings for better view-dependent effects.

Result: EventNeuS achieves a 34% reduction in Chamfer distance and 31% reduction in mean absolute error compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: EventNeuS significantly advances event-based 3D reconstruction, offering better performance and accuracy in 3D representation learning.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.

### [258] [Prefix Consensus For Censorship Resistant BFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02892)
*Zhuolun Xiang,Andrei Tonkikh,Alexander Spiegelman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Prefix Consensus and Strong Prefix Consensus to address weak censorship resistance in BFT blockchain protocols. It designs a leaderless, multi-proposer protocol with optimal round-complexity and message delays, emphasizing censorship resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BFT consensus in blockchains suffers from weak censorship resistance, where leaders can exclude transactions, impacting trading and DeFi activities.

Method: The paper defines new abstractions: Prefix Consensus (ensuring partial output agreement) and Strong Prefix Consensus (consensus on high outputs) using leaderless, partially synchronous methods for decision-making.

Result: A leaderless, censorship-resistant BFT SMR protocol is designed that commits in four rounds. Prefix Consensus is mapped to graded and binary/validated consensus, achieving optimal latency and bounded communication complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed consensus mechanisms improve censorship resistance while maintaining efficiency in blockchain systems.

Abstract: Despite broad use of BFT consensus in blockchains, censorship resistance is weak: leaders can exclude transactions, a growing concern for trading and DeFi.
  We address this by introducing a new abstraction and protocol stack. First, we introduce \emph{Prefix Consensus}, where parties input vectors and output $(v^{\sf low},v^{\sf high})$ that (i) extend the maximum common prefix of honest inputs and (ii) satisfy $v_i^{\sf low}\preceq v_j^{\sf high}$ for all honest $i,j$. Unlike classical consensus, no single output is required. We show Prefix Consensus is solvable asynchronously and give tight round-complexity bounds.
  We then define \emph{Strong Prefix Consensus}, requiring agreement on the \emph{high} output. Our protocol is leaderless and partially synchronous: one Prefix Consensus instance decides (possibly different) lows, and additional instances yield a unique safe-to-extend high, even if an adversary can suspend one party per round.
  We lift this to a leaderless, multi-proposer, censorship-resistant BFT SMR protocol: per slot, all parties broadcast proposals, deterministically rank them, and run one Strong Prefix Consensus on proposal hashes, committing honest proposals in \emph{four rounds}. A deterministic demotion rule updates the ranking when a party's proposal is excluded, implying that after GST at most $f$ slots can miss an honest proposal while progress remains leaderless under suspension and up to $f{-}1$ Byzantine faults.
  Finally, we connect Prefix Consensus to graded and binary/validated consensus: we obtain an optimal-latency graded consensus (3 message delays) and leaderless Binary/Validated Consensus with worst-case message complexity $O(n^3)$ and communication $O(n^4)$.

*Ruihan Lin,Zezhen Ding,Zean Han,Jiheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel scheduling framework for managing large language model (LLM) inference workloads on GPU clusters, addressing contention and workload heterogeneity issues to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have high demand for GPU resources, and the two-phase inference process (prefill and decode phases) causes resource contention issues, especially with varied workload characteristics such as input/output lengths.

Method: Introduced a stochastic control framework, modeled inference tasks as multiclass queueing networks with state-dependent service rates, and developed gate-and-route scheduling policies proven to be asymptotically optimal.

Result: The proposed scheduling policies outperform standard heuristics in managing LLM inference, as demonstrated through numerical experiments based on empirical data.

Conclusion: Efficient scheduling of heterogeneous LLM workloads can significantly enhance GPU resource utilization and meet service level objectives, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed framework and policies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming critical infrastructure for enterprise applications, driving unprecedented demand for GPU-based inference services. A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores controlled schedule preemption strategies for dynamic task graph scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in dynamic task graph scheduling and optimize trade-offs between makespan, fairness, utilization, and runtime.

Method: The Last-K Preemption model selectively reschedules only recent task graph allocations while preserving earlier ones. It uses synthetic and real-world workloads for analysis.

Result: Moderate preemption achieves comparable makespan and utilization benefits to full preemption, while enhancing fairness and minimizing overhead.

Conclusion: Controlled, partial preemption can offer better balance between performance metrics and scheduling efficiency compared to full preemption strategies.

Abstract: Dynamic scheduling of task graphs is often addressed without revisiting prior task allocations, with a primary focus on minimizing makespan. We study controlled schedule preemption, introducing the Last-K Preemption model, which selectively reschedules recent task graphs while preserving earlier allocations. Using synthetic, RIoTBench, WFCommons, and adversarial workloads, we compare preemptive, non-preemptive, and partial-preemptive strategies across makespan, fairness, utilization, and runtime. Results show moderate preemption can match most makespan and utilization gains of full preemption while maintaining fairness and low overhead.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses rate allocation across sources and service nodes, optimizing end-to-end delay under capacity and load constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently allocating traffic rates in networked systems is complex due to rate-dependent delays and queueing delays, affecting system performance.

Method: The paper formulates the problem as a convex program, with solutions derived using KKT conditions and develops a distributed algorithm based on congestion pricing.

Result: The distributed algorithm converges to the system-optimal centralized solution, validated through numerical illustrations.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical distributed approach that balances access and service congestion, achieving optimal rate allocation in networked systems.

Abstract: This paper studies an important rate allocation problem that arises in many networked and distributed systems: steady-state traffic rate allocation from multiple sources to multiple service nodes when both (i) the access-path delay on each source-node route is rate-dependent (capacity-constrained) and convex, and (ii) each service node (also capacity-constrained) experiences a load-dependent queueing delay driven by aggregate load from all sources. We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.

TL;DR: The paper explores how blockchain validators can utilize multi-core CPUs to optimize block construction and execution under transaction constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in blockchain systems by leveraging multi-core CPUs while adhering to blockchain semantics like transaction order and runtime limits.

Method: The study formalizes two optimization problems using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for block execution and scheduling, and introduces heuristics for scalability.

Result: The researchers conducted empirical tests using Ethereum mainnet data to examine the trade-offs between optimality and runtime of their methods.

Conclusion: Validators can potentially boost efficiency in blockchain systems by exploiting multi-core parallelism but must carefully balance trade-offs between execution speed and optimality.

Abstract: Blockchain validators can reduce block processing time by exploiting multi-core CPUs, but deterministic execution must preserve a given total order while respecting transaction conflicts and per-block runtime limits. This paper systematically examines how validators can exploit multi-core parallelism during both block construction and execution without violating blockchain semantics. We formalize two validator-side optimization problems: (i) executing an already ordered block on \(p\) cores to minimize makespan while ensuring equivalence to sequential execution; and (ii) selecting and scheduling a subset of mempool transactions under a runtime limit \(B\) to maximize validator reward. For both, we develop exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations that capture conflict, order, and capacity constraints, and propose fast deterministic heuristics that scale to realistic workloads. Using Ethereum mainnet traces and including a Solana-inspired declared-access baseline (Sol) for ordered-block scheduling and a simple reward-greedy baseline (RG) for block construction, we empirically quantify the trade-offs between optimality and runtime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to minimize energy consumption per participant during Agreement resolution in distributed systems.

Method: A recursive Agreement algorithm is introduced, optimizing the number of active rounds per participant.

Result: The algorithm achieves $O(\log f)$ active rounds per participant, where $f$ denotes the maximum crash faults.

Conclusion: The study advances energy-efficient Agreement algorithms for distributed computing, reducing participant's energy costs in fault scenarios.

Abstract: Agreement is a foundational problem in distributed computing that have been studied extensively for over four decades. Recently, Meir, Mirault, Peleg and Robinson introduced the notion of \emph{Energy Efficient Agreement}, where the goal is to solve Agreement while minimizing the number of round a party participates in, thereby reducing the energy cost per participant. We show a recursive Agreement algorithm that has $O(\log f)$ active rounds per participant, where $f<n$ represents the maximum number of crash faults in the system.

TL;DR: DALI addresses inefficiencies in Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures by dynamically assigning workloads to optimize both CPU and GPU usage, improving prefetch accuracy, and enhancing GPU caching policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle inefficiencies in utilizing MoE architectures on resource-constrained local PCs, specifically addressing CPU-GPU imbalance, inaccurate prefetching, and poor GPU cache utilization.

Method: DALI employs a dynamic assignment strategy via 0-1 integer optimization for CPU/GPU allocation, a Residual-Based Prefetching method exploiting inter-layer residuals, and a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy to improve efficiency.

Result: DALI significantly enhances speed and efficiency during both prefill and decoding phases compared to existing MoE offloading frameworks.

Conclusion: DALI effectively mitigates critical inefficiencies in MoE inference, making resource utilization more balanced and achieving faster performance on local PC platforms.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures significantly enhance the capacity of LLMs without proportional increases in computation, but at the cost of a vast parameter size. Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper revisits synchronous optimization methods and demonstrates their near-optimality in many heterogeneous computational settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been significant progress in asynchronous optimization methods, but synchronous approaches are still predominantly used. The paper investigates whether synchronous methods can perform optimally under diverse scenarios.

Method: The paper theoretically analyzes synchronous SGD and its robust variant, $m$-Synchronous SGD, under both random computation times and adversarial worker participation.

Result: The analysis reveals that synchronous SGD methods are nearly optimal in various heterogeneous computation regimes, achieving optimal time complexities up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: Synchronous methods, although not universally superior, are sufficient for numerous heterogeneous computation scenarios, contrary to the expectation that asynchronous methods may be necessary.

Abstract: Modern distributed optimization methods mostly rely on traditional synchronous approaches, despite substantial recent progress in asynchronous optimization. We revisit Synchronous SGD and its robust variant, called $m$-Synchronous SGD, and theoretically show that they are nearly optimal in many heterogeneous computation scenarios, which is somewhat unexpected. We analyze the synchronous methods under random computation times and adversarial partial participation of workers, and prove that their time complexities are optimal in many practical regimes, up to logarithmic factors. While synchronous methods are not universal solutions and there exist tasks where asynchronous methods may be necessary, we show that they are sufficient for many modern heterogeneous computation scenarios.

### [266] [UNSO: Unified Newton Schulz Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02500)
*Chen Hu,Qianxi Zhao,Yuming Li,Mingyu Zhou,Xiyin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new iterative framework called Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO) to enhance the efficiency and stability of the Newton-Schulz iteration, overcoming inefficiencies in the conventional approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the Newton-Schulz iteration's stability and efficiency, addressing inefficiencies and high computational costs in matrix operations over long dimensions.

Method: The proposed UNSO framework eliminates polynomial expansion by evaluating and removing insignificant matrix power terms. It introduces a recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients, which are further optimized for enhanced performance and convergence.

Result: UNSO shows outstanding performance with stable convergence compared to conventional Newton-Schulz iterations and other improved approaches.

Conclusion: UNSO provides a more efficient and stable alternative to the traditional Newton-Schulz iteration, offering improved results without increasing computational burden.

Abstract: The Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration has gained increasing interest for its role in the Muon optimizer and the Stiefel manifold. However, the conventional NS iteration suffers from inefficiency and instability. Although various improvements have been introduced to NS iteration, they fail to deviate from the conventional iterative paradigm, which could increase computation burden largely due to the matrix products along the long dimension repeatedly. To address this, we consolidate the iterative structure into a unified framework, named Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO). To do so, we could avoid a polynomial expansion. Instead, we evaluate the role of each matrix power, remove the insignificant terms, and provide a recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients. These learnable coefficients are then optimized, and achieve an outstanding performance with stable convergence. The code of our method is available: https://github.com/greekinRoma/Unified_Newton_Schulz_Orthogonalization.

*Saurabh Anand,Shubham Malaviya,Manish Shukla,Sachin Lodha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve AI models in cybersecurity by using parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for pre-trained language models and integrating large language models for data labelling and fallback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges like data drift, scarcity of labeled data, and risks of overfitting, which hinder effective training and deployment of AI models in real-world cybersecurity applications.

Method: The authors use parameter-efficient fine-tuning by combining compacters with layer freezing strategies. They introduce strategies involving large language models for data labelling and as fallback mechanisms for low-confidence predictions.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that combining parameter-efficient pre-trained models and large language models improves the reliability and robustness of AI models.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the applicability of AI models in cybersecurity by addressing challenges and improving performance, making them more reliable for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Training AI models in cybersecurity with help of vast datasets offers significant opportunities to mimic real-world behaviors effectively. However, challenges like data drift and scarcity of labelled data lead to frequent updates of models and the risk of overfitting. To address these challenges, we used parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained language models wherein we combine compacters with various layer freezing strategies. To enhance the capabilities of these pre-trained language models, in this work we introduce two strategies that use large language models. In the first strategy, we utilize large language models as data-labelling tools wherein they generate labels for unlabeled data. In the second strategy, large language modes are utilized as fallback mechanisms for predictions having low confidence scores. We perform comprehensive experimental analysis on the proposed strategies on different downstream tasks specific to cybersecurity domain. We empirically demonstrate that by combining parameter-efficient pre-trained models with large language models, we can improve the reliability and robustness of models, making them more suitable for real-world cybersecurity applications.

### [268] [Sparse Adapter Fusion for Continual Learning in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02502)
*Min Zeng,Xi Chen,Haiqin Yang,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM) for continual learning in NLP to address inefficiencies in parameter reuse and catastrophic forgetting, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in continual learning for NLP, such as inefficient parameter reuse, risk of catastrophic forgetting in dissimilar tasks, and unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, hindering knowledge sharing.

Method: The SAFM involves two stages: (1) the decision stage, where it determines whether to reuse or incorporate new adapters while prioritizing efficiency, and (2) the tuning stage, encouraging differentiation between adapters to capture task-specific knowledge.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters.

Conclusion: SAFM offers a highly efficient and effective approach for continual learning in NLP, successfully optimizing parameter usage, minimizing forgetting, and enhancing knowledge sharing across tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning in natural language processing plays a crucial role in adapting to evolving data and preventing catastrophic forgetting. Despite significant progress, existing methods still face challenges, such as inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risking catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and the unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, which hampers knowledge sharing among similar tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task. Experimental results consistently show that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters.

### [269] [Refining Decision Boundaries In Anomaly Detection Using Similarity Search Within the Feature Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02925)
*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Petko Valtchev,James Cheney,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder and a new active learning framework for detecting rare anomalies in imbalanced datasets, particularly in cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of detecting rare and diverse anomalies in highly imbalanced datasets like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), where conventional active learning approaches fail to exploit the data's geometric structure.

Method: The paper proposes the SDA2E model for compact latent representation learning and a similarity-guided active learning framework with three strategies: mormal-like expansion, anomaly-like prioritization, and hybrid refinement. A novel similarity measure, SIM_NM1, is introduced for sparse binary embeddings.

Result: The method was extensively tested on 52 datasets, achieving up to 1.0 nDCG ranking and reducing labeled data usage by 80% compared to passive training. It outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: SDA2E provides a robust, efficient, and statistically validated solution for anomaly detection, particularly effective in cybersecurity applications like detecting APTs.

Abstract: Detecting rare and diverse anomalies in highly imbalanced datasets-such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in cybersecurity-remains a fundamental challenge for machine learning systems. Active learning offers a promising direction by strategically querying an oracle to minimize labeling effort, yet conventional approaches often fail to exploit the intrinsic geometric structure of the feature space for model refinement. In this paper, we introduce SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder designed to learn compact and discriminative latent representations from imbalanced, high-dimensional data. We further propose a similarity-guided active learning framework that integrates three novel strategies to refine decision boundaries efficiently: mormal-like expansion, which enriches the training set with points similar to labeled normals to improve reconstruction fidelity; anomaly-like prioritization, which boosts ranking accuracy by focusing on points resembling known anomalies; and a hybrid strategy that combines both for balanced model refinement and ranking. A key component of our framework is a new similarity measure, Normalized Matching 1s (SIM_NM1), tailored for sparse binary embeddings. We evaluate SDA2E extensively across 52 imbalanced datasets, including multiple DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios, and benchmark it against 15 state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Results demonstrate that SDA2E consistently achieves superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0 in several cases) while reducing the required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training. Statistical tests confirm the significance of these improvements. Our work establishes a robust, efficient, and statistically validated framework for anomaly detection that is particularly suited to cybersecurity applications such as APT detection.

### [270] [Learning ORDER-Aware Multimodal Representations for Composite Materials Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02513)
*Xinyao Li,Hangwei Qian,Jingjing Li,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ORDER framework to improve AI-based understanding and material property predictions for composites, addressing challenges caused by their continuous design space and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unique challenges in composite material discovery, such as the lack of well-defined graph structures and the continuous nonlinear nature of their design space, which makes traditional AI methods less effective.

Method: The paper proposes the ORDER (Ordinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment) framework, a multimodal pretraining approach that creates material representations based on property-driven ordinality to preserve the continuity of composite property spaces.

Result: ORDER demonstrates superior performance across tasks like property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation compared to prior multimodal AI frameworks.

Conclusion: By incorporating ordinality into material representations, ORDER effectively addresses the challenges of continuous composite design spaces and data sparsity, showing significant promise for composite material applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.

### [271] [RPG-AE: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Autoencoders with Rare Pattern Mining for Provenance-Based Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02929)
*Asif Tauhid,Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Mohamad Altrabulsi,Ahamed Foisal,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework using a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) and rare pattern mining to detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in system-level data, demonstrating improved detection performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APTs pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term behaviors, blending into normal system operations and evading detection.

Method: The framework constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors and learns normal relation structures via a Graph Autoencoder. Deviations from the reconstructed graph indicate anomalies, and rare pattern mining boosts anomaly scores for processes with infrequent behavioral signatures.

Result: Evaluation on DARPA Transparent Computing datasets shows substantial improvements in anomaly ranking quality and performance comparable to ensemble aggregation methods, outperforming unsupervised approaches.

Conclusion: The combination of graph-based representation learning and classical pattern mining enhances anomaly detection's effectiveness and interpretability within provenance-based security frameworks.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

*Jagan Mohan Reddy Dwarampudi,Jennifer L Purks,Joshua Wong,Renjie Hu,Tania Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a reproducible and bias-resistant machine learning framework targeted towards small neuroimaging datasets, emphasizing reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typical cross-validation frameworks often introduce optimistic bias, causing poor reproducibility in small-sample biomedical datasets. The study aims to address reliability and generalization issues in machine learning applications within data-limited domains.

Method: The framework integrates domain-informed feature engineering, nested cross-validation, and decision-threshold optimization. It applies these techniques to high-dimensional structural MRI data, optimizing interpretability through importance-guided feature ranking.

Result: The suggested framework demonstrated a balanced accuracy of 0.660 ± 0.068 using the proposed nested cross-validation approach. The feature selection was also compact and interpretable.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical and unbiased computational framework, improving reliability and interpretability for machine learning in small, high-dimensional neuroimaging datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a reproducible, bias-resistant machine learning framework that integrates domain-informed feature engineering, nested cross-validation, and calibrated decision-threshold optimization for small-sample neuroimaging data. Conventional cross-validation frameworks that reuse the same folds for both model selection and performance estimation yield optimistically biased results, limiting reproducibility and generalization. Demonstrated on a high-dimensional structural MRI dataset of deep brain stimulation cognitive outcomes, the framework achieved a nested-CV balanced accuracy of 0.660\,$\pm$\,0.068 using a compact, interpretable subset selected via importance-guided ranking. By combining interpretability and unbiased evaluation, this work provides a generalizable computational blueprint for reliable machine learning in data-limited biomedical domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This systematic review evaluates computational methods, especially machine learning, for predicting length of stay after elective spine surgery, finding that machine learning models consistently outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to optimize patient outcomes and hospital resources by improving the prediction accuracy of length of stay for elective spine surgery patients.

Method: The systematic review adheres to PRISMA guidelines, analyzing studies from 2015 to 2024 that apply statistical or machine learning models to predict length of stay.

Result: 29 studies meeting criteria show machine learning models outperform traditional methods with AUCs of 0.94-0.99, using predictors such as age, comorbidities, BMI, and surgery specifics.

Conclusion: Machine learning models demonstrate strong potential, but standardized definitions and external validations are necessary for clinical application and improved deployment.

Abstract: Objective: Predicting length of stay after elective spine surgery is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and hospital resource use. This systematic review synthesizes computational methods used to predict length of stay in this patient population, highlighting model performance and key predictors. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library for studies published between December 1st, 2015, and December 1st, 2024. Eligible studies applied statistical or machine learning models to predict length of stay for elective spine surgery patients. Three reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Results: Out of 1,263 screened studies, 29 studies met inclusion criteria. Length of stay was predicted as a continuous, binary, or percentile-based outcome. Models included logistic regression, random forest, boosting algorithms, and neural networks. Machine learning models consistently outperformed traditional statistical models, with AUCs ranging from 0.94 to 0.99. K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes achieved top performance in some studies. Common predictors included age, comorbidities (notably hypertension and diabetes), BMI, type and duration of surgery, and number of spinal levels. However, external validation and reporting practices varied widely across studies. Discussion: There is growing interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning in length of stay prediction, but lack of standardization and external validation limits clinical utility. Future studies should prioritize standardized outcome definitions and transparent reporting needed to advance real-world deployment. Conclusion: Machine learning models offer strong potential for length of stay prediction after elective spine surgery, highlighting their potential for improving discharge planning and hospital resource management.

### [274] [Contrastive Concept-Tree Search for LLM-Assisted Algorithm Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03132)
*Timothee Leleu,Sudeera Gunathilaka,Federico Ghimenti,Surya Ganguli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), a new method to exploit hierarchical representations extracted from LLM-generated programs for efficient algorithm discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of LLM-driven algorithm discovery, which suffers from a lack of optimal usage of LLM internal program space representation for solving tasks.

Method: CCTS extracts hierarchical concepts from generated programs and uses a contrastive likelihood-ratio score to bias search towards beneficial combinations, avoiding misleading ones.

Result: CCTS achieves better search efficiency compared to fitness-based methods across combinatorics problems and synthetic environments, largely by identifying concepts to avoid.

Conclusion: CCTS enhances LLM-assisted algorithm discovery by leveraging concept hierarchies and contrastive models, improving search dynamics and interpretability.

Abstract: Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.

*Prakhar Godara,Frederick Callaway,Marcelo G. Mattar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified model for binary sequence prediction tasks, introducing an adversarial construction approach for identifying tasks eliciting unique behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a general theory of human behavior across tasks, focusing specifically on binary sequence prediction tasks.

Method: Utilized an adversarial construction approach to identify and explore tasks in a task-space defined by hidden Markov models, prioritizing tasks that provoke novel behaviors.

Result: Adversarial construction outperforms random sampling, showing promise for designing optimal experiments in large task spaces.

Conclusion: The adversarial approach offers a more efficient exploration of high-dimensional task spaces, improving experimental design for predicting human behavior.

Abstract: Despite decades of work, we still lack a robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in the simplest domains. In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space. In particular we consider the space of binary sequence prediction tasks where the observations are generated by the space parameterized by hidden Markov models (HMM). As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior. Our results suggest that adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments and therefore could be used as a proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces.

### [276] [GraphDancer: Training LLMs to Explore and Reason over Graphs via Curriculum Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02518)
*Yuyang Bai,Zhuofeng Li,Ping Nie,Jianwen Xie,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphDancer is a framework designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) in navigating graph-structured knowledge through reinforcement learning. It achieves superior cross-domain reasoning with moderate-sized LLMs compared to larger baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in reasoning over graph-structured knowledge due to schema-defined relations and the need for multi-hop evidence aggregation, which necessitate better functional execution and iterative reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce GraphDancer, an RL framework with a graph-aware curriculum that uses an easy-to-hard biased sampler for structured training. It aims to improve LLMs' ability to navigate and reason over graph-based data.

Result: GraphDancer significantly outperforms larger baseline models in cross-domain reasoning tasks as tested on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types, despite using a smaller 3B backbone.

Conclusion: GraphDancer demonstrates that moderate-sized LLMs can achieve robust generalization and reasoning skills in graph exploration tasks through reinforcement learning, addressing core challenges in structured knowledge navigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external knowledge to improve factuality, yet many real-world knowledge sources are organized as heterogeneous graphs rather than plain text. Reasoning over such graph-structured knowledge poses two key challenges: (1) navigating structured, schema-defined relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions often demands multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking. We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types. Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization of graph exploration and reasoning skills.

*Antonino Emanuele Scurria,Dimitri Vanden Abeele,Bortolo Matteo Mognetti,Serge Massar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper generalizes Equilibrium Propagation (EP) for nonconservative systems and demonstrates better performance using an enhanced algorithm tested on MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend Equilibrium Propagation to nonconservative systems, as existing methods are limited to conservative systems and fail to compute exact gradients for systems with non-reciprocal interactions.

Method: The authors modify the dynamics in the learning phase by introducing a term proportional to the system's non-reciprocal component, ensuring the exact gradient is calculated. They also derive the algorithm via a variational formulation.

Result: The proposed framework is validated through numerical experiments on MNIST, demonstrating faster learning and improved performance compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The study successfully extends EP to nonconservative systems while maintaining key properties of using stationary states, providing a practical and efficient solution for various applications.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether recurrent neural networks can create structured models of objects and relations through action-conditioned sequential prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how predictive neural networks can create structured world models relevant to adaptive cognition.

Method: A recurrent neural network is trained on sequential token prediction, mimicking saccades across 2D token scenes, with analyses decoding identity-position bindings.

Result: It finds improved prediction accuracy in novel scenes due to in-context learning, illustrating path integration and dynamic token identity binding.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic explanation of how flexible bindings emerge in neural networks to support sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive functions.

Abstract: Adaptive cognition requires structured internal models representing objects and their relations. Predictive neural networks are often proposed to form such "world models", yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One hypothesis is that action-conditioned sequential prediction suffices for learning such world models. In this work, we investigate this possibility in a minimal in-silico setting. Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science.

*Terence D Sanger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDPA is reformulated to show it functions as a projection onto a dynamic, context-based surface, enabling optimization and potential extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to reinterpret the core principle of scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) to better align it with mathematical signal processing methods and elucidate its function in nonlinear dependencies.

Method: They rewrite SDPA mathematically as projections of input vectors onto a context-dependent surface determined by the inputs, diverging from traditional 'query, key, value' frameworks.

Result: The reformulation highlights SDPA's ability to uncover context- and time-dependent nonlinear relationships leading to improved algorithmic efficiency and conceptual extensions.

Conclusion: SDPA should be viewed as modifying token embeddings based on dynamic contextual surfaces, rather than as 'self-attention,' explaining its effectiveness for time-series data.

Abstract: Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) is a fundamental component responsible for the success of large-language models and other nonlinear signal processing applications. The rationale for SDPA has been based upon "query, key, value" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of "self-attention", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSGD-AC, an adaptive decentralized training method, showing that non-vanishing consensus errors can improve optimization and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception that decentralized training is inferior due to consensus errors, and explore their potential as beneficial implicit regularizers.

Method: The proposed method (DSGD-AC) intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors using a time-dependent scaling mechanism.

Result: DSGD-AC outperforms standard decentralized SGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Consensus errors are a useful implicit regularizer, offering a novel perspective for decentralized learning algorithm design.

Abstract: Decentralized training is often regarded as inferior to centralized training because the consensus errors between workers are thought to undermine convergence and generalization, even with homogeneous data distributions. This work challenges this view by introducing decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC), which intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors through a time-dependent scaling mechanism. We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima. Across image classification and machine translation benchmarks, DSGD-AC consistently surpasses both standard DSGD and centralized SGD in test accuracy and solution flatness. Together, these results establish consensus errors as a useful implicit regularizer and open a new perspective on the design of decentralized learning algorithms.

Motivation: To create an efficient and high-performing language model using less data and compute power while approaching the performance of much larger models.

### [282] [TabularMath: Evaluating Computational Extrapolation in Tabular Learning via Program-Verified Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02523)
*Zerui Cheng,Jiashuo Liu,Jianzhu Yao,Pramod Viswanath,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabularMath is introduced as a diagnostic benchmark for tabular models, evaluating their capacity to perform computational extrapolation beyond statistical interpolation. Results reveal limitations of tabular models in achieving precise computational outputs, emphasizing complementary strengths between TabPFN and in-context learning (ICL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in evaluating tabular models' ability to move beyond statistical interpolation and perform computational extrapolation, which is essential for deterministic datasets like financial modeling and physical simulations.

Method: The authors introduce TabularMath, a benchmark of 114 deterministic problems derived from verified programs, and evaluate 9 tabular architectures as well as in-context learning using GPT-OSS-120B.

Result: TabPFN v2.5 performs exceptionally well in R^2 regression metrics both in-distribution and under distribution shift but struggles with exact computational outputs. In comparison, ICL performs better on exact matches but with fewer data.

Conclusion: Tabular models excel at smooth function approximations but fail at precise computational extrapolation. TabPFN and ICL show complementary strengths, suggesting a need for further research into integrating these approaches.

Abstract: Standard tabular benchmarks mainly focus on the evaluation of a model's capability to interpolate values inside a data manifold, where models good at performing local statistical smoothing are rewarded. However, there exists a very large category of high-value tabular data, including financial modeling and physical simulations, which are generated based upon deterministic computational processes, as opposed to stochastic and noisy relationships. Therefore, we investigate if tabular models can provide an extension from statistical interpolation to computational extrapolation.
  We propose TabularMath, a diagnostic benchmark of 114 deterministic problems (233,472 rows) generated from verified programs based on GSM8K and AIME. We evaluate 9 tabular architectures and in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-OSS-120B. On standard regression metrics, TabPFN v2.5 performs remarkably well, achieving R^2=0.998 in-distribution and maintaining positive R^2 even under distribution shift, which is unique among the tabular models we tested. When we measure rounded consistency (exact integer match), a different picture emerges: TabPFN v2.5 drops below 10% on out-of-distribution data, while ICL maintains around 40%. This gap between R^2 and exact-match accuracy suggests that tabular models learn smooth function approximations but struggle to recover precise computational outputs under extrapolation. The two paradigms appear complementary: TabPFN scales efficiently with data; ICL achieves exact computation from few examples. We release all code and data to support further investigation.

### [283] [Dynamic Topology Optimization for Non-IID Data in Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03383)
*Bart Cox,Antreas Ioannou,Jérémie Decouchant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes "Morph," a topology optimization algorithm for decentralized learning that improves model accuracy in non-IID and static settings through adaptive peer selection based on model dissimilarity. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning struggles with high model accuracy under non-IID data distributions and static communication topology. The authors aim to address this limitation.

Method: The authors introduce Morph, a topology optimization algorithm where nodes adaptively select peers based on maximum model dissimilarity, maintaining fixed in-degree and dynamically reshaping communication graphs through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection.

Result: Morph outperformed static and epidemic baselines in experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST, improving test accuracy by 1.12x and 1.08x, respectively, while closely approaching the fully connected upper bound. It showed faster convergence, improved stability, and fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: Morph effectively addresses data heterogeneity issues in decentralized learning by improving accuracy and efficiency without requiring global knowledge, offering significant practical benefits.

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables a set of nodes to train a model collaboratively without central coordination, offering benefits for privacy and scalability. However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge.

### [284] [The "Robert Boulton" Singularity: Semantic Tunneling and Manifold Unfolding in Recursive AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02526)
*Pengyue Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uncovers a failure mode called "Semantic Tunneling" in generative AI using recursive synthetic training data, where semantic diversity collapses due to optimizing statistical safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative AI stability and semantic diversity when trained on recursive synthetic data, addressing the limitations of conventional metrics like Perplexity (PPL).

Method: They identify "Semantic Tunneling" through a sliding-window protocol and propose using the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework with Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) to enhance AI's semantic diversity.

Result: The MNCIS and ASNC framework successfully expanded the model's effective rank from 3.62 to 5.35, increasing semantic diversity and preserving the long-tail data distribution.

Conclusion: Their approach prevents the semantic collapse observed in generative AI models, enabling more robust handling of diverse narratives while challenging conventional evaluation methods like PPL.

Abstract: The stability of generative artificial intelligence trained on recursive synthetic data is conventionally monitored via Perplexity (PPL). We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed "Semantic Tunneling." While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the "Robert Boulton" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces "Manifold Unfolding." MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an "Artificial Manifold" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.

### [285] [Mitigating Staleness in Asynchronous Pipeline Parallelism via Basis Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03515)
*Hyunji Jung,Sungbin Shin,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Asynchronous pipeline parallelism improves hardware utilization by eliminating pipeline bubbles but suffers from gradient staleness and linear delay with pipeline depth. This work tackles these issues using basis rotation, significantly improving scalability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the inefficiency caused by gradient staleness and pipeline depth in asynchronous pipeline parallelism, which undermines scalability in large neural network training.

Method: The authors propose basis rotation to realign the Hessian eigenbasis with the standard coordinate basis, enabling curvature-aware adaptive schemes like Adam to function more effectively in asynchronous training.

Result: The authors demonstrate theoretically and empirically the advantage of basis rotation, achieving a 76.8% reduction in iterations needed to reach the same training loss for a 1B-parameter LLM compared to existing asynchronous methods.

Conclusion: Basis rotation effectively addresses gradient staleness and alignment issues, restoring scalable asynchronous pipeline parallelism and accelerating convergence in large-scale training.

Abstract: Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.

### [286] [Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02528)
*Lixiang Fan,Bohao Li,Tao Zou,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGSTGNN, a novel framework to improve traffic forecasting by explicitly modeling the impacts of transportation incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic forecasting models neglect the impact of unpredictable incidents like accidents and adverse weather, leading to reduced accuracy.

Method: IGSTGNN models incident impact via Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) for spatial influence and Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) for dynamic effect reduction.

Result: State-of-the-art performance is achieved on a new large-scale dataset containing traffic and incident data. Modules are also seamlessly integrated into other models.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling incident impacts improves traffic prediction accuracy. The released dataset facilitates further research.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.

### [287] [Formulating Reinforcement Learning for Human-Robot Collaboration through Off-Policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02530)
*Saurav Singh,Rodney Sanchez,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that uses off-policy evaluation (OPE) to select state representations and reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) using only logged data, reducing human involvement and real-time interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods are labor-intensive, requiring domain expertise and real-time interactions, making them unsuitable for complex and safety-critical real-world applications. There is a need to reduce such dependencies.

Method: The proposed framework leverages OPE to evaluate and select optimal state spaces and reward functions offline—without needing environment interaction—by training offline RL agents.

Result: The method was validated on the OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander environment and a real-world NASA-MATB-II human-robot interaction scenario, demonstrating its robustness and applicability.

Conclusion: This approach automates key RL design choices, making offline RL more practical, reducing costs, and promoting scalability for real-world, human-robot interaction settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to transform real-world decision-making systems by enabling autonomous agents to learn from experience. Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios. This work enhances the feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions through a data-driven OPE-based evaluation, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings.

*Trishit Mondal,Ameya D. Jagtap*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy to control hypersonic inlet unstart at Mach 5, demonstrating robust and generalizable performance under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in hypersonic unstart phenomena affecting reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and flow instabilities hinder performance.

Method: The study utilized a DRL-based control strategy integrated with a high-fidelity CFD solver to simulate hypersonic inlet dynamics, learning optimal control policies under realistic conditions such as back pressure fluctuations, noisy measurements, and minimal sensor configurations.

Result: The DRL controller effectively stabilized the hypersonic inlet across a range of back pressures and operational uncertainties, generalizing to unseen scenarios and performing well with noisy sensor inputs and minimal sensors.

Conclusion: This study provides a practical, data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control, demonstrating robust performance under operational uncertainties and paving the way for reliable air-breathing propulsion at extreme speeds.

Abstract: The hypersonic unstart phenomenon poses a major challenge to reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and rapid pressure fluctuations can destabilize inlet operation. Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation. These results establish a data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties.

*Mahyar Alinejad,Yue Wang,George Atia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CADENT integrates automaton-based strategic knowledge with policy-level tactical guidance using experience-gated dynamic trust, significantly enhancing sample efficiency and adaptation in RL transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of domain shift and ineffective knowledge transfer in RL, especially the failure of existing methods to unify strategic and tactical guidance effectively.

Method: The CADENT framework combines strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level guidance, introducing an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically balances teacher and student inputs depending on state-action conditions.

Result: CADENT achieves 40-60% improved sample efficiency over baselines while retaining strong asymptotic performance across diverse RL environments, including grid worlds and continuous control.

Conclusion: CADENT successfully establishes a superior model for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL by unifying differing forms of guidance and enabling context-sensitive adaptation in new domains.

Abstract: Transfer learning promises to reduce the high sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet existing methods struggle with domain shift between source and target environments. Policy distillation provides powerful tactical guidance but fails to transfer long-term strategic knowledge, while automaton-based methods capture task structure but lack fine-grained action guidance. This paper introduces Context-Aware Distillation with Experience-gated Transfer (CADENT), a framework that unifies strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level knowledge into a coherent guidance signal. CADENT's key innovation is an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically weighs teacher guidance against the student's own experience at the state-action level, enabling graceful adaptation to target domain specifics. Across challenging environments, from sparse-reward grid worlds to continuous control tasks, CADENT achieves 40-60\% better sample efficiency than baselines while maintaining superior asymptotic performance, establishing a robust approach for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel hybrid deep learning framework, HyExDNN-RNN, for ADHD detection and classification with high accuracy, using explainable AI techniques for transparent diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in diagnosing ADHD by providing reliable, interpretable, and advanced computational methods that support psychological applications.

Method: The study utilized the HyExDNN-RNN model integrating feature selection (Pearson correlation), machine learning, and deep learning techniques, along with explainable AI methods like SHAP and PFI for transparent decision-making.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 99% for binary classification and 94.2% for multi-class categorization, while offering insights into feature importance and decision processes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential to improve ADHD diagnosis accuracy and provide interpretable insights, bridging AI techniques and psychological practices.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is challenging to diagnose and requires advanced approaches for reliable and transparent identification and classification. It is characterized by a pattern of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that is more severe and more frequent than in individuals with a comparable level of development. In this paper, an explainable framework based on a fine-tuned hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called HyExDNN-RNN model is proposed for ADHD detection, multi-class categorization, and decision interpretation. This framework not only detects ADHD, but also provides interpretable insights into the diagnostic process so that psychologists can better understand and trust the results of the diagnosis. We use the Pearson correlation coefficient for optimal feature selection and machine and deep learning models for experimental analysis and comparison. We use a standardized technique for feature reduction, model selection and interpretation to accurately determine the diagnosis rate and ensure the interpretability of the proposed framework. Our framework provided excellent results on binary classification, with HyExDNN-RNN achieving an F1 score of 99% and 94.2% on multi-class categorization. XAI approaches, in particular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), provided important insights into the importance of features and the decision logic of models. By combining AI with human expertise, we aim to bridge the gap between advanced computational techniques and practical psychological applications. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to assist in ADHD diagnosis and interpretation.

*Tianle Gu,Kexin Huang,Lingyu Li,Ruilin Luo,Shiyang Huang,Zongqi Wang,Yujiu Yang,Yan Teng,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMod, a novel multimodal safety moderation approach addressing shortcut learning and data sparsity, proposing trajectory-based learning and achieving efficient and effective moderation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve multimodal safety moderation, overcoming challenges like data sparsity and reliance on binary labels that lead to shortcut learning, which limits effective content discrimination.

Method: The paper develops UniMod, a structured learning framework transforming decision-making into a reasoning process, combined with UniRM, a multi-head scalar reward model offering multi-dimensional supervision. Specialized optimization is introduced for multi-task learning.

Result: UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation results, establishes new multimodal benchmarks with 40% of the leading baseline training data, and validates multi-attribute trajectory reasoning effectiveness.

Conclusion: UniMod and UniRM provide a robust and efficient framework for multimodal content moderation, addressing limitations of traditional binary labeling and promoting comprehensive safety semantics learning.

Abstract: Safety moderation is pivotal for identifying harmful content. Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

*Zheqi Lv,Zhenxuan Fan,Qi Tian,Wenqiao Zhang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents FAQ, a post-training quantization approach for large language models, which improves upon limitations of existing methods using future-layer activations for guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues such as quantization bias and error accumulation in post-training quantization of large language models, especially when calibration data is biased.

Method: The paper proposes FAQ, which uses future-layer activations and a window-wise preview mechanism to guide quantization more effectively, avoiding reliance on calibration noise and eliminating computationally expensive steps.

Result: FAQ consistently surpasses existing quantization methods in performance, with negligible additional cost, and is tailored for edge deployment without backward passes, data reconstruction, or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FAQ provides a robust and efficient alternative to existing PTQ methods, improving quantization stability and performance at minimal cost and without requiring extensive resources.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used method to compress large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. It typically sets quantization hyperparameters (e.g., scaling factors) based on current-layer activations. Although this method is efficient, it suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal and unstable quantization, especially when the calibration data is biased. To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead. Experiments show that FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requiring no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it well-suited for edge deployment.

*Shuxin Zhuang,Zi Liang,Runsheng Yu,Hongzong Li,Rong Feng,Shiqin Tang,Youzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the information capacity of vision-centric models, identifying phase transitions when processing increased visual data and develops a probabilistic scaling law for optimizing efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the upper limit of information visual tokens can represent and optimize compression without sacrificing recognition performance.

Method: Stress tests are conducted by progressively increasing character information within images, analyzing results with a probabilistic scaling law based on average token load and visual density.

Result: Three distinct phases are identified—Stable, Instability, and Collapse—providing insights into mechanical transitions in vision encoding. A probabilistic scaling law applicable across multiple Vision-Language Models is developed.

Conclusion: This study reveals fundamental mechanics in visual token compression and offers a universal scaling law to improve efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Recent vision-centric approaches have made significant strides in long-context modeling. Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase. We analyze the mechanical origins of these transitions and identify key factors. Furthermore, we formulate a probabilistic scaling law that unifies average vision token load and visual density into a latent difficulty metric. Extensive experiments across various Vision-Language Models demonstrate the universality of this scaling law, providing critical empirical guidance for optimizing the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in visual context compression.

*Arturo Tozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method using the Fubini Study metric to analyze high-dimensional representation drift, addressing ambiguities caused by gauge transformations like rescaling or sign flips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like Euclidean and cosine distances overestimate representation drift in high-dimensional systems, often failing to separate meaningful changes from parametrization artifacts.

Method: The paper adopts a projective geometric framework using the Fubini Study metric, tracks representation trajectories, and contrasts results with traditional metrics like Euclidean and cosine distances.

Result: The Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic representation drift while remaining invariant under gauge-induced variations, outperforming conventional metrics in measuring meaningful evolution.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a geometric method for assessing representation stability and assures improved diagnostics of structural evolution in high-dimensional datasets without introducing model-specific assumptions.

Abstract: High dimensional representation drift is commonly quantified using Euclidean or cosine distances, which presuppose fixed coordinates when comparing representations across time, training or preprocessing stages. While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances. Embedding representation dynamics in projective space connects data analysis with established geometric programs and yields observables that are directly testable in empirical workflows.

*Qingyu Wu,Jianfei Shen,Feiyi Fan,Yang Gu,Chenyang Xu,Yiqiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoCL is proposed as a novel contrastive learning method for human activity recognition (HAR) with a self-augmenting approach to improve recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of designing effective and automated data augmentation strategies for low-semantic sensor signals in human activity recognition (HAR), as traditional approaches relying on manual augmentation lack generalizability and flexibility in contrastive learning (CL).

Method: The authors introduced AutoCL, an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning method using a Siamese network with shared backbone parameters and an embedded generator that learns augmentation in the latent space. Additionally, they proposed a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy to enhance representation learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four widely-used HAR datasets showed that AutoCL significantly improves recognition accuracy, outperforming other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that AutoCL effectively mitigates the augmentation burden, enhances encoder representation learning, and delivers superior performance for wearable-based HAR.

Abstract: For low-semantic sensor signals from human activity recognition (HAR), contrastive learning (CL) is essential to implement novel applications or generic models without manual annotation, which is a high-performance self-supervised learning (SSL) method. However, CL relies heavily on data augmentation for pairwise comparisons. Especially for low semantic data in the HAR area, conducting good performance augmentation strategies in pretext tasks still rely on manual attempts lacking generalizability and flexibility. To reduce the augmentation burden, we propose an end-to-end auto-augmentation contrastive learning (AutoCL) method for wearable-based HAR. AutoCL is based on a Siamese network architecture that shares the parameters of the backbone and with a generator embedded to learn auto-augmentation. AutoCL trains the generator based on the representation in the latent space to overcome the disturbances caused by noise and redundant information in raw sensor data. The architecture empirical study indicates the effectiveness of this design. Furthermore, we propose a stop-gradient design and correlation reduction strategy in AutoCL to enhance encoder representation learning.

### [296] [Learning Better Certified Models from Empirically-Robust Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02626)
*Alessandro De Palma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using knowledge distillation from adversarially-trained teachers to improve certified robustness and standard performance of neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches for robust neural network models faced trade-offs between standard performance and certified robustness, looking to balance these limitations.

Method: The authors introduce knowledge distillation with a feature-space distillation objective, leveraging teachers trained with adversarial methods to enhance robust models.

Result: The method achieves improved performance for certifiably-robust models, outperforming prior approaches on robust computer vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: By combining adversarial training and distillation techniques, the paper demonstrates a reliable pathway for enhancing both certified robustness and standard performance of neural networks.

Abstract: Adversarial training attains strong empirical robustness to specific adversarial attacks by training on concrete adversarial perturbations, but it produces neural networks that are not amenable to strong robustness certificates through neural network verification. On the other hand, earlier certified training schemes directly train on bounds from network relaxations to obtain models that are certifiably robust, but display sub-par standard performance. Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art trade-offs between certified robustness and standard performance can be obtained through a family of losses combining adversarial outputs and neural network bounds. Nevertheless, differently from empirical robustness, verifiability still comes at a significant cost in standard performance. In this work, we propose to leverage empirically-robust teachers to improve the performance of certifiably-robust models through knowledge distillation. Using a versatile feature-space distillation objective, we show that distillation from adversarially-trained teachers consistently improves on the state-of-the-art in certified training for ReLU networks across a series of robust computer vision benchmarks.

*Mingda Liu,Zhenghan Zhu,Ze'an Miao,Katsuki Fujisawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model editing with Locate-and-Edit methods faces challenges in model collapse due to weight norm growth. A new approach, Norm-Anchor Scaling (NAS), mitigates this issue effectively and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of model collapse caused by the exponential growth of MLP weight norms during sequential edits in the Locate-and-Edit framework for large language models.

Method: The proposed method, Norm-Anchor Scaling (NAS), constrains the growth of weight norms during edits. It is a plug-and-play strategy requiring minimal implementation effort.

Result: NAS delays the collapse point of existing L&E algorithms by over 4 times and achieves a 72.2% average improvement in editing performance while incurring minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Norm-Anchor Scaling effectively mitigates model collapse in the L&E framework, enhancing its robustness and usability for sequence editing tasks.

Abstract: Model editing has emerged as a practical approach for mitigating factual errors and outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.

### [298] [Membership Inference Attacks from Causal Principles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02819)
*Mathieu Even,Clément Berenfeld,Linus Bleistein,Tudor Cebere,Julie Josse,Aurélien Bellet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores Membership Inference Attack (MIA) evaluation as a causal inference problem to identify and address biases in existing evaluation methods, introducing practical and statistically consistent estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and validity of MIA evaluations, particularly addressing the high computational costs and statistical weaknesses in current evaluation methods for training data memorization and privacy risks.

Method: Reframes MIA evaluation as causal inference, identifying biases in current evaluation methods, and derives causal equivalents for standard metrics. Further, it introduces estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with consistency guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates that the proposed causal-based approach enables accurate and reliable memorization measurement even under constraints such as distribution shift or impractical retraining.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework for evaluating training data memorization and privacy risks in AI using causal inference techniques, strengthening the reliability of MIA metrics.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to quantify training data memorization and assess privacy risks. Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.

*Wenhao Sun,Rong-Cheng Tu,Yifu Ding,Zhao Jin,Jingyi Liao,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SPA-Cache to improve Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) by speeding up hidden state updates during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Diffusion Language Models suffer from inefficient decoding due to the lack of caching methods that address costly recomputation and uniform resource allocation.

Method: Introduces SPA-Cache with a singular proxy for identifying critical updates and an adaptive strategy for budget allocation, targeting efficiency.

Result: SPA-Cache improves DLM decoding efficiency by achieving up to 8× throughput improvement over standard methods and 2–4× speedup compared to existing caching approaches.

Conclusion: SPA-Cache significantly enhances DLM efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: While Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a flexible, arbitrary-order alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, their non-causal nature precludes standard KV caching, forcing costly hidden state recomputation at every decoding step. Existing DLM caching approaches reduce this cost by selective hidden state updates; however, they are still limited by (i) costly token-wise update identification heuristics and (ii) rigid, uniform budget allocation that fails to account for heterogeneous hidden state dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SPA-Cache that jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation in DLM cache. First, we derive a low-dimensional singular proxy that enables the identification of update-critical tokens in a low-dimensional subspace, substantially reducing the overhead of update identification. Second, we introduce an adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality. Together, these contributions significantly improve the efficiency of DLMs, yielding up to an $8\times$ throughput improvement over vanilla decoding and a $2$--$4\times$ speedup over existing caching baselines.

### [300] [A Random Matrix Theory Perspective on the Consistency of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02908)
*Binxu Wang,Jacob Zavatone-Veth,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines why diffusion models produce consistent outputs despite being trained on separate subsets of data, attributing this to shared Gaussian statistics and linear effects in dataset splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and formalize the consistency in outputs of diffusion models trained on different subsets of a dataset, and its connection to spectral properties of the data.

Method: The authors use random matrix theory (RMT) to quantify the effects of finite datasets on diffusion models' denoiser and sampling map, analyzing expectations and variances based on Gaussian statistics and eigenproperties.

Result: They demonstrate that shared statistics heavily influence generated images, and introduce variance formulas to uncover factors like anisotropy, inhomogeneity, and data size scaling that drive cross-split disagreements.

Conclusion: The study offers a theoretical framework rooted in random matrix theory for explaining reproducibility in diffusion training, predicting stability and deviations in generative outputs based on data spectral properties.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on different, non-overlapping subsets of a dataset often produce strikingly similar outputs when given the same noise seed. We trace this consistency to a simple linear effect: the shared Gaussian statistics across splits already predict much of the generated images. To formalize this, we develop a random matrix theory (RMT) framework that quantifies how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of the learned denoiser and sampling map in the linear setting. For expectations, sampling variability acts as a renormalization of the noise level through a self-consistent relation $σ^2 \mapsto κ(σ^2)$, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward the dataset mean. For fluctuations, our variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: \textit{anisotropy} across eigenmodes, \textit{inhomogeneity} across inputs, and overall scaling with dataset size. Extending deterministic-equivalence tools to fractional matrix powers further allows us to analyze entire sampling trajectories. The theory sharply predicts the behavior of linear diffusion models, and we validate its predictions on UNet and DiT architectures in their non-memorization regime, identifying where and how samples deviates across training data split. This provides a principled baseline for reproducibility in diffusion training, linking spectral properties of data to the stability of generative outputs.

### [301] [Beyond Alignment: Expanding Reasoning Capacity via Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02545)
*Dayu Wang,Jiaye Yang,Weikang Li,Jiahui Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a method to expand reasoning space in LLMs beyond pre-trained biases, achieving state-of-the-art performance in mathematical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for LLMs might only realign latent reasoning capabilities rather than genuinely expanding them, and this paper aims to challenge that limitation by rethinking how latent reasoning can be modified geometrically.

Method: MRPO restructures the reasoning space of LLMs through two steps: Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to escape the pre-trained bias manifold, and Effective Rank regularization to maintain high-dimensional reasoning trajectories.

Result: The proposed MRPO method outperformed much larger models (like Qwen3-32B) and set new benchmarks in mathematical reasoning tasks using only a 4B-parameter model.

Conclusion: Through targeted geometric interventions, MRPO expands the reasoning capability of LLMs, addressing the low-rank bias limitation of pre-trained models and pushing performance boundaries in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

### [302] [Notes on the Reward Representation of Posterior Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02912)
*Pedro A. Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies decision-making using Bayesian inference and investigates when KL-regularized soft updates can be interpreted as Bayesian posterior updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how decision-making processes can be framed as inference and study the exact conditions for KL-regularized soft updates to match Bayesian posterior updates.

Method: Analyze KL-regularized updates within fixed probabilistic models to establish if they are equivalent to Bayesian posterior updates, focusing on coherence in reward descriptions linked to different orders of conditioning.

Result: KL-regularized updates can act as Bayesian posterior updates when behavioral changes are explainable as evidence reweighting, although absolute rewards remain context dependent.

Conclusion: While Bayesian inference offers useful insights into decision-making, absolute rewards are context-dependent and coherence constraints must link rewards across conditions to ensure consistency.

Abstract: Many ideas in modern control and reinforcement learning treat decision-making as inference: start from a baseline distribution and update it when a signal arrives. We ask when this can be made literal rather than metaphorical. We study the special case where a KL-regularized soft update is exactly a Bayesian posterior inside a single fixed probabilistic model, so the update variable is a genuine channel through which information is transmitted. In this regime, behavioral change is driven only by evidence carried by that channel: the update must be explainable as an evidence reweighing of the baseline. This yields a sharp identification result: posterior updates determine the relative, context-dependent incentive signal that shifts behavior, but they do not uniquely determine absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. Requiring one reusable continuation value across different update directions adds a further coherence constraint linking the reward descriptions associated with different conditioning orders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents D$^2$Quant, a framework improving weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) in large language models, addressing accuracy issues at sub-4-bit precision by tackling problems in weight quantization and activation deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally expensive, making deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments. Weight-only PTQ can alleviate these costs, but accuracy suffers significantly at precision below 4-bit, necessitating effective techniques for maintaining performance.

Method: The framework introduces a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) for down-projection matrices, with absorbable scaling factors boosting accuracy. It also proposes Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), mitigating activation distribution shifts using LayerNorm adjustments.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that D$^2$Quant achieves superior results compared to existing methods for weight-only PTQ in LLMs at sub-4-bit precision, impacting memory usage and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: D$^2$Quant effectively improves sub-4-bit weight-only PTQ by addressing key bottlenecks, ensuring better deployment of LLMs in resource-limited scenarios while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance, but their high compute and memory costs make deployment difficult in resource-constrained scenarios. Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision.

### [304] [Why Some Models Resist Unlearning: A Linear Stability Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02986)
*Wei-Kai Chang,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the theoretical framework of machine unlearning, focusing on the role of data geometry and coherence in optimization and forgettability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of machine unlearning and understand the conditions when it works, despite its critical role in privacy, regulation, and efficiency.

Method: The authors leverage the concept of asymptotic linear stability and introduce data coherence metrics to analyze unlearning. They provide a theoretical analysis using random matrix theory and a signal-plus-noise model to link data geometry to unlearning properties.

Result: They identify coherence thresholds influencing unlearning and outline when forgetting succeeds or fails. Stronger memorization (weaker signal-to-noise ratio) enhances forgettability, supported by empirical results like Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps mapping stability boundaries.

Conclusion: This work gives the first structured evaluation of the interplay between memorization, data coherence, and unlearning, providing useful insights for more effective unlearning methods in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the ability to erase the effect of specific training samples without retraining from scratch, is critical for privacy, regulation, and efficiency. However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Noise-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (naPINN) to tackle challenges in solving inverse problems under heavy measurement noise and outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PINNs' robustness in handling noisy and heavily corrupted observational data, as their performance degrades significantly in such scenarios.

Method: naPINN integrates an energy-based model within its training loop to detect and adaptively filter high-energy data points, supported by a reliability gate and rejection cost regularization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate naPINN's ability to outperform robust PINN baselines, effectively isolating outliers and reconstructing dynamics under severe noise and outlier conditions.

Conclusion: naPINN reliably addresses noise and outliers without prior noise distribution knowledge, enabling robust physical solution recovery from degraded data.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective methods for solving inverse problems and discovering governing equations from observational data. However, their performance degrades significantly under complex measurement noise and gross outliers. To address this issue, we propose the Noise-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (naPINN), which robustly recovers physical solutions from corrupted measurements without prior knowledge of the noise distribution. naPINN embeds an energy-based model into the training loop to learn the latent distribution of prediction residuals. Leveraging the learned energy landscape, a trainable reliability gate adaptively filters data points exhibiting high energy, while a rejection cost regularization prevents trivial solutions where valid data are discarded. We demonstrate the efficacy of naPINN on various benchmark partial differential equations corrupted by non-Gaussian noise and varying rates of outliers. The results show that naPINN significantly outperforms existing robust PINN baselines, successfully isolating outliers and accurately reconstructing the dynamics under severe data corruption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ToolTok introduces a multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents through progressive tool usage, achieving better performance, efficient learning, and strong generalization with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agent models struggle with generalization across varying input resolutions using coordinate-based methods or face challenges in data-scarce scenarios with alternative approaches.

Method: ToolTok uses a multi-step pathfinding approach, semantically anchored tool embeddings, and a curriculum of language-based and visual tasks for progressive learning.

Result: ToolTok outperforms models of similar scale, competes with larger models, and requires significantly less training data—under 1% compared to alternatives—showing excellent generalization.

Conclusion: ToolTok advances GUI agent modeling with efficient data usage, better scalability, and broad generalization capability, paving the way for novel paradigms in tool representation and interaction.

Abstract: Existing GUI agent models relying on coordinate-based one-step visual grounding struggle with generalizing to varying input resolutions and aspect ratios. Alternatives introduce coordinate-free strategies yet suffer from learning under severe data scarcity. To address the limitations, we propose ToolTok, a novel paradigm of multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents, where operations are modeled as a sequence of progressive tool usage. Specifically, we devise tools aligned with human interaction habits and represent each tool using learnable token embeddings. To enable efficient embedding learning under limited supervision, ToolTok introduces a semantic anchoring mechanism that grounds each tool with semantically related concepts as natural inductive bias. To further enable a pre-trained large language model to progressively acquire tool semantics, we construct an easy-to-hard curriculum consisting of three tasks: token definition question-answering, pure text-guided tool selection, and simplified visual pathfinding. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ToolTok achieves superior performance among models of comparable scale (4B) and remains competitive with a substantially larger model (235B). Notably, these results are obtained using less than 1% of the training data required by other post-training approaches. In addition, ToolTok demonstrates strong generalization across unseen scenarios. Our training & inference code is open-source at https://github.com/ZephinueCode/ToolTok.

*Zihan Dong,Zhixian Zhang,Yang Zhou,Can Jin,Ruijia Wu,Linjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new evaluation framework for mathematical reasoning in language models, addressing issues of small benchmark sizes and result variability using semiparametric estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to overcome the challenges of limited benchmark sizes and unstable model ranking in evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning, especially for difficult questions where traditional accuracy and rankings are unreliable.

Method: The method involves introducing a statistically efficient framework that integrates labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals from models judging reasoning chains. A semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) is developed to improve evaluation precision.

Result: The proposed one-step estimator demonstrated increased ranking accuracy, variance reduction, and asymptotic normality. It provided robust results in both simulations and experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework delivers more precise performance evaluation and stable model rankings, particularly benefiting scenarios with small sample sizes and high variability in model output.

Abstract: Evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs is constrained by limited benchmark sizes and inherent model stochasticity, yielding high-variance accuracy estimates and unstable rankings across platforms. On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows. Experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K further demonstrate more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is pretty unstable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyPAC, a method to route data inputs to cost-efficient annotation sources, ensuring annotation error is controlled with formal guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing annotation cost against quality, especially when multiple annotation sources like LLMs, reasoning models, and humans are available.

Method: HyPAC adaptively routes data using calibrated thresholds based on uncertainty. It uses importance sampling and upper confidence bounds to ensure optimal source selection while controlling annotation error.

Result: HyPAC significantly reduces annotation costs by 78.51% while maintaining tight control over annotation errors.

Conclusion: HyPAC demonstrates efficient annotation routing with cost savings, offering PAC guarantees on annotation error without reliance on data distribution or pre-trained models.

Abstract: Data annotation often involves multiple sources with different cost-quality trade-offs, such as fast large language models (LLMs), slow reasoning models, and human experts. In this work, we study the problem of routing inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while controlling the labeling error on test instances. We propose \textbf{HyPAC}, a method that adaptively labels inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while providing distribution-free guarantees on annotation error. HyPAC calibrates two decision thresholds using importance sampling and upper confidence bounds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to the appropriate annotation source. We prove that HyPAC achieves the minimum expected cost with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on the annotation error, free of data distribution and pre-trained models. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing the annotation cost by 78.51\% while tightly controlling the annotation error.

*Baohao Liao,Hanze Dong,Xinxing Xu,Christof Monz,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAGE, an improved framework for reinforcement learning with large language models under sparse rewards, solving the limitations of GRPO by adding privileged hints during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO struggles under sparse terminal rewards as it leads to reward collapse and ineffective updates. The motivation is to address these issues by reshaping the sampling distribution and improving policy performance.

Method: The proposed method introduces SAGE, where privileged hints (like plans) are sampled during training to increase diversity and prevent reward collapse. These hints do not affect task rewards but guide optimization. At test time, hints are omitted, ensuring fairness in deployment.

Result: SAGE achieves better performance compared to GRPO across multiple benchmarks, with gains of +2.0, +1.2, and +1.3 on different LLM setups, demonstrating improved optimization and adaptability.

Conclusion: By incorporating privileged hints and adaptive curriculums, SAGE solves GRPO's limitations under sparse rewards, ensuring robust policy learning and better outcomes in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex temporal patterns and multimodal features in Web-scale tasks lead to challenges such as error accumulation, vulnerability to out-of-distribution samples, and optimization stagnation in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: A lightweight Transformer model is combined with the Escape-Explore Optimizer (EEO) to improve exploration, generalization, and avoid sharp minima and saddle-point traps.

Result: The method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models across 11 time-series datasets and the Synapse medical image segmentation task, with improved generalization and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows potential as a versatile solution for Web-scale data mining and analysis, addressing foundational limitations in large-scale tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have achieved remarkable progress in tasks such as time-series forecasting and image segmentation. However, they frequently suffer from error accumulation in multivariate long-sequence prediction and exhibit vulnerability to out-of-distribution samples in image-related tasks. Furthermore, these challenges become particularly pronounced in large-scale Web data analysis tasks, which typically involve complex temporal patterns and multimodal features. This complexity substantially increases optimization difficulty, rendering models prone to stagnation at saddle points within high-dimensional parameter spaces. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight Transformer architecture in conjunction with a novel Escape-Explore Optimizer (EEO). The optimizer enhances both exploration and generalization while effectively avoiding sharp minima and saddle-point traps. Experimental results show that, in representative Web data scenarios, our method achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art models across 11 time-series benchmark datasets and the Synapse medical image segmentation task. Moreover, it demonstrates superior generalization and stability, thereby validating its potential as a versatile cross-task foundation model for Web-scale data mining and analysis.

Motivation: High-quality code-documentation pairs are rare and costly, limiting the training of models for code tasks, especially for niche programming languages.

Method: BatCoder uses back-translation strategies and reinforcement learning by generating documentation from code and reconstructing code from the documentation, leveraging semantic similarity as reward.

Result: BatCoder outperforms open-source baselines, achieving 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1 on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks with a 7B model.

Conclusion: BatCoder significantly boosts training feasibility for code-related tasks by enabling effective training with only code, demonstrating scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Training LLMs for code-related tasks typically depends on high-quality code-documentation pairs, which are costly to curate and often scarce for niche programming languages. We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.

*Bizhe Bai,Xinyue Wang,Peng Ye,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSN-RLVR enhances Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards to improve reasoning in LLMs by introducing trajectory-level exploration and adaptive noise control, yielding gains in solving mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exploration ceiling in RLVR approaches, which limits effective discovery of new strategies under large sampling budgets.

Method: PSN-RLVR perturbs policy parameters for trajectory-level exploration, employs truncated importance sampling (TIS) to address sampling-update mismatch, and uses real-time adaptive noise scheduling based on semantic diversity and self-certainty.

Result: PSN-GRPO, an instantiation of PSN-RLVR, improves pass-at-k performance under large sampling budgets across mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PSN-RLVR effectively enhances LLM reasoning, expands its boundary on various benchmarks, and outperforms prior exploration strategies while being orthogonal and composable.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.

*Xuancheng Li,Haitao Li,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving LLMs by introducing SEAM, a module for structured experience reuse, enhancing reasoning performance effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the static nature of LLMs and their tendency to redo reasoning or repeat mistakes by providing an efficient and robust mechanism for experience reuse.

Method: The authors propose SEAM, a plug-in module trained through executor rollouts and GRPO. It stores structured, instance-specific experiences within its parameters for guiding LLMs during reasoning tasks while keeping the core LLM frozen.

Result: SEAM significantly improves reasoning accuracy in mathematical benchmarks with minimal computational overhead. Ablations confirm its robustness.

Conclusion: SEAM effectively enhances LLM performance by leveraging structured, utility-trained experience reuse. Its ability to improve upon deployment highlights its practical value.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are largely static and often redo reasoning or repeat mistakes. Prior experience reuse typically relies on external retrieval, which is similarity-based, can introduce noise, and adds latency. We introduce SEAM (Structured Experience Adapter Module), a lightweight, executor-specific plug-in that stores experience in its parameters and generates a structured, instance-tailored experience entry in a single forward pass to guide a frozen LLM executor. SEAM is trained for utility via executor rollouts and GRPO while keeping the executor frozen, and it can be further improved after deployment with supervised fine-tuning on logged successful trajectories. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains across executors with low overhead. Extensive ablations and analyses further elucidate the mechanisms underlying SEAM's effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces daVinci-Agency, a data synthesis approach for training LLMs on long-horizon tasks using structured supervision derived from pull request (PR) sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with long-horizon tasks due to the lack of authentic training data that captures long-dependency structures and dynamics, and existing methods aren't scalable or efficient.

Method: The authors propose daVinci-Agency, which uses structured data from PR sequences, incorporating mechanisms for task decomposition, functional consistency, and bug-fix refinements to teach persistent goal-directed behavior.

Result: Fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on daVinci-Agency samples resulted in notable performance improvements, including a 47% relative gain on the Toolathlon benchmark.

Conclusion: daVinci-Agency enhances long-horizon task learning in LLMs by leveraging real-world software development as a model for task refinement and long-term consistency.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms...

*Yupeng Chen,Junchi Yu,Aoxi Liu,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how textual jailbreak attacks can transfer to audio systems in multimodal AI models, finding that textual vulnerabilities extend effectively to audio setups due to strong modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the largely unexplored connection between textual and audio jailbreak attacks and to address the implications of cross-modality integrity in omni-models.

Method: The authors analyzed modality alignment effects on vulnerability transfer, conducted empirical tests of various jailbreak attacks (text, text-audio transfer, and purely audio-based), and evaluated cross-model transferability under robust conditions.

Result: The study revealed that text-transferred audio attacks not only match but can outperform audio-based methods, demonstrating high effectiveness even with stricter audio-access constraints.

Conclusion: Text-based vulnerabilities can propagate across modalities, posing significant safety risks for multimodal systems. These findings highlight the need for more robust defenses and future attention to cross-modality safety.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.

*Philipp J. Schneider,Daniel Kuhn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable layer solving gradient saturation issues in deep learning systems with hard constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gradient saturation caused by existing projection methods in incorporating hard constraints for safety-critical systems.

Method: The authors propose Soft-Radial Projection, a radial mapping technique that ensures strict feasibility and avoids rank-deficient Jacobians, aiding better optimization.

Result: The method retains universal approximation property and demonstrates improved convergence and solution quality over existing methods in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Soft-Radial Projection overcomes optimization stalls seen in boundary-based projections, making it a reliable approach for constraints in deep learning models.

Abstract: Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.

*Zekang Yang,Hong Liu,Xiangdong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel interpretable deep learning framework called PA-MIL for cancer subtyping in pathology image analysis. It emphasizes phenotype awareness over traditional methods' post-hoc interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of post-hoc interpretability in traditional deep learning methods used for analyzing pathology whole-slide images, aiming for more accountable and reliable cancer subtyping explanations.

Method: The proposed PA-MIL approach integrates phenotype-aware learning by constructing a phenotype knowledge base, utilizing morphology-based language prompts, and employing a Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) for multi-level interpretative guidance.

Result: PA-MIL demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods while significantly advancing interpretability, leveraging phenotype saliency, and providing reliable cohort-level and case-level insights.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines competitive cancer subtyping with advanced interpretability by using phenotype-based evidence, establishing its reliability and accountability for practical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively researched in the analysis of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs). However, most existing methods are limited to providing prediction interpretability by locating the model's salient areas in a post-hoc manner, failing to offer more reliable and accountable explanations. In this work, we propose Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (PA-MIL), a novel ante-hoc interpretable framework that identifies cancer-related phenotypes from WSIs and utilizes them for cancer subtyping. To facilitate PA-MIL in learning phenotype-aware features, we 1) construct a phenotype knowledge base containing cancer-related phenotypes and their associated genotypes. 2) utilize the morphological descriptions of phenotypes as language prompting to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) devise the Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) grounded in genotype-to-phenotype relationships, which provides multi-level guidance for PA-MIL. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. PA-MIL leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and, using a linear classifier, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the genotype-phenotype relationships, as well as cohort-level and case-level interpretability, demonstrating the reliability and accountability of PA-MIL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sybil, a deep learning model for lung cancer risk prediction from CT scans, shows high precision but lacks causal verification. S(H)NAP, a new auditing framework, identifies Sybil's successes and critical failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for causal verification in assessing deep learning models like Sybil for lung cancer predictions, beyond correlation-based assessments.

Method: Proposed S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework using 3D diffusion bridge modeling for generative interventional attributions analyzed by expert radiologists.

Result: S(H)NAP identifies Sybil's strengths, such as expert-like lung nodule differentiation, and highlights its critical flaws like sensitivity to artifacts and radial bias.

Conclusion: Causal verification via S(H)NAP is crucial for uncovering limitations in models like Sybil, ensuring reliability before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, driving the development of automated screening tools to alleviate radiologist workload. Standing at the frontier of this effort is Sybil, a deep learning model capable of predicting future risk solely from computed tomography (CT) with high precision. However, despite extensive clinical validation, current assessments rely purely on observational metrics. This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score. Providing the first interventional audit of Sybil, we demonstrate that while the model often exhibits behavior akin to an expert radiologist, differentiating malignant pulmonary nodules from benign ones, it suffers from critical failure modes, including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and a distinct radial bias.

*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the sensitivity and stability aspects of training learning systems and shows when stability mechanisms do/don't explain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role stability plays in modern learning systems, particularly when interpolation is present, to explain their generalization capabilities.

Method: Developing a framework based on a function-space trajectory modeling training dynamics, proposing a contractive propagation condition, and deriving a stability certificate.

Result: The stability certificate predicts generalization differences across several training variables. It also identifies conditions where stability explains generalization versus when other mechanisms must step in.

Conclusion: Stability explains generalization in certain regimes, but alternative mechanisms are necessary for others, easing the understanding of training sensitivity and providing predictive insights.

Abstract: Modern learning systems often interpolate training data while still generalizing well, yet it remains unclear when algorithmic stability explains this behavior. We model training as a function-space trajectory and measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory.
  We propose a contractive propagation condition and a stability certificate obtained by unrolling the resulting recursion. A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, while we also prove that there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing that stability is not a universal explanation.
  Experiments confirm that certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations. The framework therefore identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success.

*Jiaming Ma,Binwu Wang,Pengkun Wang,Xu Wang,Zhengyang Zhou,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method, ReLearner, to address performance issues in spatiotemporal prediction models by introducing a bidirectional learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spatiotemporal prediction models struggle when there are discrepancies between inputs and target labels, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The proposed method, ReLearner, employs a bidirectional learning framework through an auxiliary inverse process that learns residuals between input and future data and consists of two modules: a Residual Learning Module to handle feature discrepancies and a Residual Smoothing Module to stabilize learning.

Result: Experiments on 11 datasets and 14 models show that ReLearner significantly improves prediction performance for Spatiotemporal Neural Networks.

Conclusion: ReLearner enhances existing models by integrating bidirectional learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling spatiotemporal discrepancies and achieving better predictive outcomes.

Abstract: Prevailing spatiotemporal prediction models typically operate under a forward (unidirectional) learning paradigm, in which models extract spatiotemporal features from historical observation input and map them to target spatiotemporal space for future forecasting (label). However, these models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance when spatiotemporal discrepancies exist between inputs and labels, for instance, when nodes with similar time-series inputs manifest distinct future labels, or vice versa. To address this limitation, we propose explicitly incorporating label features during the training phase. Specifically, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Residual Theorem, which generalizes the conventional unidirectional spatiotemporal prediction paradigm into a bidirectional learning framework. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we design an universal module, termed ReLearner, which seamlessly augments Spatiotemporal Neural Networks (STNNs) with a bidirectional learning capability via an auxiliary inverse learning process. In this process, the model relearns the spatiotemporal feature residuals between input data and future data. The proposed ReLearner comprises two critical components: (1) a Residual Learning Module, designed to effectively disentangle spatiotemporal feature discrepancies between input and label representations; and (2) a Residual Smoothing Module, employed to smooth residual terms and facilitate stable convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 real-world datasets across 14 backbone models demonstrate that ReLearner significantly enhances the predictive performance of existing STNNs.Our code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimal transport (OT) mapping on high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, introducing Riemannian Neural OT maps to avoid the curse of dimensionality associated with discrete methods, achieving scalability and effective approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural OT methods are limited to Euclidean geometry, and extending them to Riemannian manifolds faces challenges tied to dimensional issues and discretization.

Method: The authors propose Riemannian Neural OT maps, which use continuous neural-network parameterizations for OT maps, incorporating geometric structures directly without relying on discretized approximations.

Result: Riemannian Neural OT maps approximate Riemannian OT more efficiently with sub-exponential complexity compared to traditional discrete methods. Experiments show scalability and competitive outcomes.

Conclusion: Riemannian Neural OT maps offer a promising approach for generative modeling on high-dimensional manifolds, overcoming limitations of existing discretization methods.

Abstract: Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, scalable data annotation is costly, prone to annotator variability, and critical for supervised learning in large-scale datasets.

Method: AURA employs agentic AI with a probabilistic model combining Expectation-Maximization and confusion matrix analysis to infer true labels and annotator reliability without relying on ground truths.

Result: Across four benchmarks, AURA improves accuracy by up to 5.8% in typical cases and 50% in challenging annotator settings, and reliably assesses annotator quality.

Conclusion: AURA demonstrates enhanced annotation scalability, accuracy, and reliability assessment, marking progress for automated annotation pipelines in complex, multi-modal datasets.

Abstract: Data annotation is essential for supervised learning, yet producing accurate, unbiased, and scalable labels remains challenging as datasets grow in size and modality. Traditional human-centric pipelines are costly, slow, and prone to annotator variability, motivating reliability-aware automated annotation. We present AURA (Agentic AI for Unified Reliability Modeling and Annotation Aggregation), an agentic AI framework for large-scale, multi-modal data annotation. AURA coordinates multiple AI agents to generate and validate labels without requiring ground truth. At its core, AURA adapts a classical probabilistic model that jointly infers latent true labels and annotator reliability via confusion matrices, using Expectation-Maximization to reconcile conflicting annotations and aggregate noisy predictions. Across the four benchmark datasets evaluated, AURA achieves accuracy improvements of up to 5.8% over baseline. In more challenging settings with poor quality annotators, the improvement is up to 50% over baseline. AURA also accurately estimates the reliability of annotators, allowing assessment of annotator quality even without any pre-validation steps.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for high-rank matrix completion (HRMC) by clustering data into subspaces and minimizing distances, improving performance especially under low sampling rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for HRMC often lack solid theoretical support, generate uninterpretable results, and require more samples than theoretically necessary.

Method: The proposed method clusters incomplete vectors by identifying proxy subspaces using Grassmannian geometry, minimizing chordal and geodesic distances.

Result: The method achieves comparable results to leading methods with high sampling rates and outperforms them with low sampling rates, reducing the gap to the theoretical sampling limits.

Conclusion: This approach offers a theoretically supported and more effective alternative for HRMC, particularly under conditions of low data sampling.

Abstract: This paper approaches high-rank matrix completion (HRMC) by filling missing entries in a data matrix where columns lie near a union of subspaces, clustering these columns, and identifying the underlying subspaces. Current methods often lack theoretical support, produce uninterpretable results, and require more samples than theoretically necessary. We propose clustering incomplete vectors by grouping proxy subspaces and minimizing two criteria over the Grassmannian: (a) the chordal distance between each point and its corresponding subspace and (b) the geodesic distances between subspaces of all data points. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method performs comparably to leading methods in high sampling rates and significantly better in low sampling rates, thus narrowing the gap to the theoretical sampling limit of HRMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models with reinforcement learning on real-world tasks faces challenges like high costs and instability from online RL methods.

Method: The proposed method, Cobalt, uses offline code generation trajectories as contextual prompts and trains the model through single-step generation in an online bandit learning setup.

Result: Cobalt achieved significant performance improvements over existing methods (GRPO and VeRPO), improving R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench.

Conclusion: Cobalt offers a novel approach for effectively training language models on complex iterative tasks like multi-turn code generation while addressing reward hacking issues.

Abstract: Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

TL;DR: The study investigates the slow power-law convergence in loss during LLM training, linking it to intrinsic issues with softmax and cross-entropy components, which create optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why loss exhibits slow power-law convergence in training LLMs, and identify the role of specific model components in optimization bottlenecks.

Method: Systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of large language models to explore the impact of softmax and cross-entropy on training efficiency.

Result: Identifies that softmax and cross-entropy inherently cause power-law vanishing losses and gradients when learning peaked probability distributions, leading to universal exponent scaling of $1/3$.

Conclusion: The study explains observed neural scaling and proposes new directions to improve LLM training efficiency.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, partly because the loss exhibits slow power-law convergence whose origin remains debatable. Through systematic analysis of toy models and empirical evaluation of LLMs, we show that this behavior can arise intrinsically from the use of softmax and cross-entropy. When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for observed neural scaling and suggest new directions for improving LLM training efficiency.

TL;DR: This study compares predictive policing and hot spots policing in Baltimore, finding that both exhibit biases—but predictive policing, while temporarily fairer, amplifies bias faster over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing systems, addressing gaps in comparative studies, especially regarding racial bias and long-term behavior.

Method: A comprehensive simulation study in Baltimore assessing bias and performance of predictive policing compared to traditional hot spots policing.

Result: Both predictive and hot spots policing showed biases. Predictive policing was initially fairer and more accurate but became more biased over time, occasionally showing outcomes favoring over-policing in White neighborhoods.

Conclusion: Predictive policing's fairness and bias differ based on context, warranting city-specific evaluations. Simulations can identify inequities and long-term risks within these systems.

Abstract: There are ongoing discussions about predictive policing systems, such as those deployed in Los Angeles, California and Baltimore, Maryland, being unfair, for example, by exhibiting racial bias. Studies found that unfairness may be due to feedback loops and being trained on historically biased recorded data. However, comparative studies on predictive policing systems are few and are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative simulation study on the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore. Our results suggest that the situation around bias in predictive policing is more complex than was previously assumed. While predictive policing exhibited bias due to feedback loops as was previously reported, we found that the traditional alternative, hot spots policing, had similar issues. Predictive policing was found to be more fair and accurate than hot spots policing in the short term, although it amplified bias faster, suggesting the potential for worse long-run behavior. In Baltimore, in some cases the bias in these systems tended toward over-policing in White neighborhoods, unlike in previous studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a methodology for city-specific evaluation and behavioral-tendency comparison of predictive policing systems, showing how such simulations can reveal inequities and long-term tendencies.

Motivation: Existing pretraining methods rely on fixed, horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and heavy tuning, which aren't ideal for open-ended training scenarios.

Method: Introduce an anytime learning schedule involving polynomial decay rates linked to problem conditions, paired with weight averaging. The approach is evaluated empirically on various scales of language models.

Result: Anytime learning schedules match the performance of cosine decay schedules, achieving comparable final loss across extensive training ranges.

Conclusion: Weight averaging and simple learning rate schedules provide a viable anytime learning alternative to traditional cosine schedules for pretraining large language models.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained in continual or open-ended settings, where the total training horizon is not known in advance. Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.

### [328] [IceBench-S2S: A Benchmark of Deep Learning for Challenging Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Daily Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting in Deep Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02567)
*Jingyi Xu,Shengnan Wang,Weidong Yang,Siwei Tu,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces IceBench-S2S, a benchmark focused on enhancing daily seasonal-to-seasonal forecasts of Arctic sea ice using deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for Arctic sea ice forecasting are limited to subseasonal scales, hindering operational usage in areas like Arctic transportation and climate study.

Method: IceBench-S2S compresses spatial features into deep latent representations, then models temporal variations using deep learning forecasting frameworks. It standardizes training and evaluation pipelines across various models.

Result: IceBench-S2S successfully extends forecasting capability to 180-day periods, providing a generalized framework and practical model selection guidance.

Conclusion: The benchmark system establishes a robust platform to improve long-term forecasting of sea ice, crucial for ecological and operational applications.

Abstract: Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in regulating Earth's climate system, significantly influencing polar ecological stability and human activities in coastal regions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HTCL combines swift local adaptation and structured global consolidation through hierarchical Taylor expansion to mitigate task-order effects in Continual Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning systems often suffer from high variance due to random task ordering, limiting consistent performance and scalability.

Method: HTCL involves hierarchical task updates consolidated using Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion to achieve stable multiscale knowledge integration.

Result: HTCL improves mean accuracy by 7% to 25%, while reducing variance in final accuracy by up to 68% across random task orders.

Conclusion: HTCL provides a hierarchical, model-agnostic solution for Continual Learning that enhances accuracy and stability across diverse datasets and settings.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Hierarchical Taylor Series-based Continual Learning (HTCL)}$, a framework that couples fast local adaptation with conservative, second-order global consolidation to address the high variance introduced by random task ordering. To address task-order effects, HTCL identifies the best intra-group task sequence and integrates the resulting local updates through a Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion, yielding a consolidation step with theoretical guarantees. The approach naturally extends to an $L$-level hierarchy, enabling multiscale knowledge integration in a manner not supported by conventional single-level CL systems. Across a wide range of datasets and replay and regularization baselines, HTCL acts as a model-agnostic consolidation layer that consistently enhances performance, yielding mean accuracy gains of $7\%$ to $25\%$ while reducing the standard deviation of final accuracy by up to $68\%$ across random task permutations.

*Zhiqi Li,Yuchen Sun,Duowen Chen,Jinjin He,Bo Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Euler Mean Flows (EMF), a flow-based generative method improving trajectory consistency and efficiency for image synthesis and other generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of long-horizon trajectory consistency and optimization inefficiency in flow-based generative models while reducing computational costs.

Method: A novel framework called EMF replaces challenging trajectory consistency constraints with a linear surrogate derived from the semigroup formulation. This approach supports multiple prediction variants, avoids Jacobian computations, and offers a memory-efficient and computationally efficient training pipeline.

Result: EMF shows improved stability, higher sample quality, and significantly reduced training time (by ~50%) and memory usage in tasks like image synthesis and functional generation.

Conclusion: EMF provides a robust, efficient, and unified solution for generative modeling with increased performance and reduced resource consumption.

Abstract: We propose \emph{Euler Mean Flows (EMF)}, a flow-based generative framework for one-step and few-step generation that enforces long-range trajectory consistency with minimal sampling cost. The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image synthesis, particle-based geometry generation, and functional generation demonstrate improved optimization stability and sample quality under fixed sampling budgets, together with approximately $50\%$ reductions in training time and memory consumption compared to existing one-step methods for image generation.

*Haichuan Wang,Tao Lin,Lingkai Kong,Ce Li,Hezi Jiang,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the bias in LLM policies caused by KL regularization during alignment, proposing a reward model optimization method to better align with user preferences and boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods for LLM policies often inherit biases from the base policy due to KL regularization, which may conflict with user preferences. This challenge requires optimizing reward models to minimize this tradeoff and improve alignment.

Method: The authors formalize the problem as a Stackelberg game and propose a simple reward shaping scheme to approximate the optimal reward model.

Result: The method integrates smoothly with current alignment methods, improving average reward and achieving a win-tie rate over 66%, evaluated across various settings.

Conclusion: Optimizing reward models using their proposed method enhances alignment with user preferences while requiring minimal implementation overhead, proving effective and practical.

Abstract: Existing alignment methods directly use the reward model learned from user preference data to optimize an LLM policy, subject to KL regularization with respect to the base policy. This practice is suboptimal for maximizing user's utility because the KL regularization may cause the LLM to inherit the bias in the base policy that conflicts with user preferences. While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model. We empirically evaluate our method in inference-time alignment settings and demonstrate that it integrates seamlessly into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead. Our method consistently improves average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines, averaged across evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Product interactions unify and structure the construction of neural networks, offering insights based on interaction order and algebraic principles.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce product interactions, an algebraic formalism in which neural network layers are constructed from compositions of a multiplication operator defined over suitable algebras. Product interactions provide a principled way to generate and organize algebraic expressions by increasing interaction order. Our central observation is that algebraic expressions in modern neural networks admit a unified construction in terms of linear, quadratic, and higher-order product interactions. Convolutional and equivariant networks arise as symmetry-constrained linear product interactions, while attention and Mamba correspond to higher-order product interactions.

*Nan Zhang,Eugene Kwek,Yusen Zhang,Muyu Pan,Suhang Wang,Prasenjit Mitra,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuantLRM, a method for weight-only quantization of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using fine-tuning signals, achieving significant improvements in various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to compress Large Reasoning Models by analyzing the impact of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning, based on a hypothesis that the smallest and largest updates are more critical for quantization.

Method: QuantLRM uses restricted quadratic functions to fit weight updates and calculate channel importance by combining average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates, outperforming existing methods.

Result: QuantLRM shows consistent improvement in LRM quantization across fine-tuned models and reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average uplift of 6.55% for reinforcement learning fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: QuantLRM effectively quantizes LRMs by leveraging fine-tuning signals and pseudo-fine-tuning, demonstrating its broad applicability and performance enhancements for model compression.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization is important for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term "protecting both ends". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.

### [334] [Copula-Based Aggregation and Context-Aware Conformal Prediction for Reliable Renewable Energy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02583)
*Alireza Moradi,Mathieu Tanneau,Reza Zandehshahvar,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve aggregated renewable energy forecasts by integrating copula-based modeling and conformal prediction, ensuring reliability and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System operators need reliable fleet-level probabilistic forecasts to manage aggregated renewable energy but often rely on site-level forecasts that fail to account for cross-site dependencies and miscalibration.

Method: The paper introduces a framework combining copula-based dependence modeling and Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to produce reliable and calibrated fleet-level forecasts.

Result: Experiments on large-scale solar datasets show that the proposed method achieves near-nominal coverage and sharper prediction intervals compared to traditional aggregation methods.

Conclusion: The Copula+CACP approach offers a practical solution for calibrated fleet-level forecasting, addressing challenges of dependency awareness and miscalibration effectively.

Abstract: The rapid growth of renewable energy penetration has intensified the need for reliable probabilistic forecasts to support grid operations at aggregated (fleet or system) levels. In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals. Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP demonstrate that the proposed Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance time series forecasting by integrating Koopman operator theory with deep learning architectures, addressing stability, interpretability, and the bias-variance trade-off.

Method: The paper introduces variants of learnable Koopman operators (e.g., scalar-gated, MLP-shaped, etc.), focusing on controlling the properties (spectrum/stability/rank) of transition operators. These are combined with nonlinear backbones and benchmarked against established models.

Result: Experiments reveal that Koopman models achieve favorable trade-offs in bias-variance, better stability, and improved interpretability. The approach is validated through large-scale benchmarks and spectral analysis.

Conclusion: Learnable Koopman operators present a theoretically sound and practical solution for integrating dynamics theory with deep forecasting, showing stability, interpretability, and effectiveness in applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a unified family of learnable Koopman operator parameterizations that integrate linear dynamical systems theory with modern deep learning forecasting architectures. We introduce four learnable Koopman variants-scalar-gated, per-mode gated, MLP-shaped spectral mapping, and low-rank Koopman operators which generalize and interpolate between strictly stable Koopman operators and unconstrained linear latent dynamics. Our formulation enables explicit control over the spectrum, stability, and rank of the linear transition operator while retaining compatibility with expressive nonlinear backbones such as Patchtst, Autoformer, and Informer. We evaluate the proposed operators in a large-scale benchmark that also includes LSTM, DLinear, and simple diagonal State-Space Models (SSMs), as well as lightweight transformer variants. Experiments across multiple horizons and patch lengths show that learnable Koopman models provide a favorable bias-variance trade-off, improved conditioning, and more interpretable latent dynamics. We provide a full spectral analysis, including eigenvalue trajectories, stability envelopes, and learned spectral distributions. Our results demonstrate that learnable Koopman operators are effective, stable, and theoretically principled components for deep forecasting.

*Jiaxuan Zou,Zixuan Gong,Ye Su,Huayi Tang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper simplifies neural scaling laws by introducing a framework based on the coverage of patterns from a Zipfian distribution, deriving precise scaling laws and unifying them under a Max-Bottleneck principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanations of neural scaling laws often rely on specific architectures or complex methods, lacking universality. The paper seeks to provide a more general, intuitive understanding.

Method: The paper models learning tasks as progressive coverage of patterns from a Zipfian distribution, introduces the Effective Frontier ($k_\star$), and derives scaling laws for model capacity, dataset size, and compute using a Max-Bottleneck principle.

Result: It provides precise scaling laws for $N$, $D$, and $C$, explaining capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks. It also unifies Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling laws as equilibrium solutions.

Conclusion: This unified framework offers a broader theoretical understanding of neural scaling laws and connects seemingly contrasting results through the Max-Bottleneck principle.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws govern the prediction power-law improvement of test loss with respect to model capacity ($N$), datasize ($D$), and compute ($C$). However, existing theoretical explanations often rely on specific architectures or complex kernel methods, lacking intuitive universality. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that abstracts general learning tasks as the progressive coverage of patterns from a long-tail (Zipfian) distribution. We introduce the Effective Frontier ($k_\star$), a threshold in the pattern rank space that separates learned knowledge from the unlearned tail. We prove that reducible loss is asymptotically determined by the probability mass of the tail a resource-dependent frontier truncation. Based on our framework, we derive the precise scaling laws for $N$, $D$, and $C$, attributing them to capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks, respectively. Furthermore, we unify these mechanisms via a Max-Bottleneck principle, demonstrating that the Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling laws are not contradictory, but equilibrium solutions to the same constrained optimization problem under different active bottlenecks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework designed to enhance optimization under constraints by structuring the process into three specialized agents, significantly outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency of existing optimization methods used in language models under strict parameter-blind constraints, especially those requiring iterative fine-tuning for systems-critical performance.

Method: ContextEvolve divides the optimization into three agents: Summarizer (code abstraction), Navigator (trajectory optimization), and Sampler (experience prioritization) to emulate reinforcement learning principles in a training-free setup.

Result: ContextEvolve achieves a 33.3% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on the ADRS benchmark and reduces token consumption by 29.0%, showcasing its superior efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables RL-like optimization in a parameter-blind context, making it a promising direction for optimizing performance-critical algorithms with large language models.

Abstract: Large language models are transforming systems research by automating the discovery of performance-critical algorithms for computer systems. Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space. On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical entity-centric framework for offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) to address long-horizon tasks involving multiple entities, achieving over 150% improvement on challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving long-horizon goals in complex multi-entity environments is difficult due to combinatorial complexity, sparse rewards, and high-dimensional observations in reinforcement learning.

Method: A two-level hierarchical framework with a value-based GCRL agent and a modular factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. They are trained independently and composed post hoc using selective subgoal generation.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves an RL agent's performance, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest benchmark task while generalizing to various horizons and entity counts.

Conclusion: The method improves GCRL for multi-entity domains, showcasing enhanced performance, generalization, and modularity while addressing challenges posed by sparse rewards and combinatorial state-spaces.

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical entity-centric framework for offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) that combines subgoal decomposition with factored structure to solve long-horizon tasks in domains with multiple entities. Achieving long-horizon goals in complex environments remains a core challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Domains with multiple entities are particularly difficult due to their combinatorial complexity. GCRL facilitates generalization across goals and the use of subgoal structure, but struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces, especially under sparse reward. We employ a two-level hierarchy composed of a value-based GCRL agent and a factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. The RL agent and subgoal generator are trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on the value function, making the approach modular and compatible with existing GCRL algorithms. We introduce new variations to benchmark tasks that highlight the challenges of multi-entity domains, and show that our method consistently boosts performance of the underlying RL agent on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest task in our suite and generalizing to increasing horizons and numbers of entities.

*Jihao Xin,Tian Lvu,Hatem Ltaief,David Keyes,Marco Canini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP) to reduce memory and compute costs in long-context inference for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV-Cache inefficiencies in modern RoPE-based LLMs lead to computational and memory bottlenecks during long-context inference.

Method: The authors propose RAP, which prunes RoPE-aligned column pairs to maintain the 2x2 RoPE rotation structure while reducing memory and computational overhead in KV-Cache and attention parameters.

Result: RAP achieves 20-30% reduction in KV-Cache size, attention parameters, and FLOPs while preserving model accuracy on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B. It decreases attention latency during inference.

Conclusion: RAP effectively optimizes long-context inference in LLMs by improving efficiency without compromising performance, resolving existing limitations in RoPE-based architectures.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.

TL;DR: This study analyzes the role of sampling mechanisms in the safety behavior of diffusion language models (DLMs) while introducing a lightweight safety signal for improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how sampling mechanisms influence refusal behavior and robustness in DLMs and AR models, with a focus on enhancing safety and interpretability.

Method: The paper develops an analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, introducing the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal to monitor safety-related behaviors in language models.

Result: The SRI signal identifies anomalous behavior through internal recovery dynamics and enables efficient detectors for harmful generations, showing competitive or superior performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Sampling strategies significantly affect safety behavior in language models, and the proposed SRI signal offers a practical and effective means to enhance safety and interpretability during text generation.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering parallel decoding and controllable sampling dynamics while achieving competitive generation quality at scale. Despite this progress, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, enabling comparison between AR and diffusion sampling. Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\times$ lower inference overhead.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised method for constructing a global reference system by learning tangent spaces of a data manifold using vector fields, achieving interpretable intrinsic coordinates and demonstrating empirical effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of isometric objectives in learning intrinsic data manifold structures, particularly the assumption of manifold flatness, and to establish a coherent global coordinate chart for improved analysis and downstream tasks.

Method: A novel unsupervised framework based on learning tangent vector fields through flows that map data samples to a common reference, with constraints to prevent collapse and a scalable integration-free objective inspired by flow matching.

Result: The method demonstrated proper alignment of tangents and coherent global coordinate structures in synthetic manifolds, and competitive performance in downstream classification tasks using CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Minimizing the proposed objective effectively recovers global coordinate charts when they exist, proving theoretical soundness and practical scalability for manifold learning applications.

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised approach for constructing a global reference system by learning, in the ambient space, vector fields that span the tangent spaces of an unknown data manifold. In contrast to isometric objectives, which implicitly assume manifold flatness, our method learns tangent vector fields whose flows transport all samples to a common, learnable reference point. The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists. Empirically, we obtain correct tangent alignment and coherent global coordinate structure on synthetic manifolds. We also demonstrate the scalability of our method on CIFAR-10, where the learned coordinates achieve competitive downstream classification performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of learning behavioral taxonomies from animal-borne sensor data with limited labels, proposing a semi-supervised discovery approach using novel containment scoring for behavior novelty detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the scarcity of labels, class imbalance, and missing behaviors in behavioral taxonomy discovery from animal motion sensor data.

Method: They developed a semi-supervised approach for behavior discovery involving embedding learning, label-guided clustering, and a KDE+HDR containment score to evaluate the novelty of discovered behavior groups.

Result: The approach successfully identifies novel behaviors, showcasing low overlap novelty detection and high overlap in negative-control settings with no genuine novelty.

Conclusion: HDR-based containment scoring proves effective in ecological motion time series, offering a practical solution for class discovery under limited annotations and challenging conditions.

Abstract: Learning behavioral taxonomies from animal-borne sensors is challenging because labels are scarce, classes are highly imbalanced, and behaviors may be absent from the annotated set. We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.

Method: The authors propose a causal offline RL objective that accounts for worst-case performance arising from confounding biases and provide a practical implementation using expressive flow-matching policies and a deep discriminator.

Result: Across 25 pixel-based tasks, the proposed method achieves a 120% success rate compared to confounding-unaware state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of causal adjustments in offline RL to overcome confounding biases, improving both robustness and overall success rates in complex tasks.

Abstract: Expressive policies based on flow-matching have been successfully applied in reinforcement learning (RL) more recently due to their ability to model complex action distributions from offline data. These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy. Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks demonstrate that our proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120\% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI systems by leveraging structural causal models and formalizing causal abstraction networks.

Method: The authors use Gaussian SCMs combined with sheaf-theoretic principles. They separate the problem into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and employ SPECTRAL, an iterative method with closed-form updates, for efficient solving.

Result: Synthetic data experiments demonstrate competitive performance in causal abstraction learning and successful reconstruction of diverse network structures.

Conclusion: The sheaf-theoretic approach and proposed methods improve causal abstraction learning, supporting the development of robust AI systems.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves and cosheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we tackle the learning of consistent causal abstraction network (CAN), a sheaf-theoretic framework where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs) adhering to the semantic embedding principle, and (iii) edge stalks correspond--up to permutation--to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

*Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the performance of smaller-sized LLM pretraining techniques, using varying forms of parallelism on GPU clusters, and proposes an optimal approach for efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable efficient pretraining of smaller-sized LLMs on limited datasets and academic testbeds, making use of commodity GPUs and optimizing pretraining methods.

Method: Different forms of parallelism (data, intra-operator, inter-operator/pipeline) and their combinations were analyzed on testbeds with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPUs. Open-source tools Alpa and Ray were used, and models like GPT-2 medium/large were pretrained under varying network conditions.

Result: Alpa's execution plans that optimize intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism performed the best, especially in GPU clusters with geographical distribution and network latencies in the range of tens of milliseconds.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and proposes a systematic approach for selecting optimal pretraining techniques, leading to better performance and resource optimization in smaller-sized LLM pretraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require enormous computing power to pretrain on massive datasets. When limited datasets are available, smaller-sized LLMs are better choice to pretrain (on user-specified datasets) by following the scaling laws of LLMs. Using pretrained models, vector embeddings can be generated for raw data and stored using vector databases to support modern AI applications and semantic search. In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining. We set up different GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPU hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of network latency on pretraining performance especially when GPUs are geographically distributed. We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed. This was especially true when the network latencies were in 10's of milliseconds. Based on the insights gained from the experiments, we propose a systematic approach for selecting the appropriate pretraining technique to achieve high training performance/lower execution time as well as to reduce the number of GPUs used.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reduction-based framework for online learning with delayed feedback, improving existing methods and achieving better regret bounds in both first-order and bandit convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing delayed feedback in online learning to improve existing theoretical results and provide delay-adaptive reduction techniques for better performance.

Method: A continuous-time model is proposed, decomposing the regret into delay-independent and delay-induced terms. This approach adapts any online linear optimization algorithm to handle round-dependent delays with unified analysis for various feedback scenarios.

Result: For bandit convex optimization, the framework achieves significantly improved regret bounds, with delay-dependent terms outperforming previous works. For first-order feedback, it recovers state-of-the-art bounds via simpler analysis.

Conclusion: The framework provides an enhanced, unified approach to handle delayed feedback in online learning, improving theoretical bounds and offering adaptive solutions for various feedback and optimization settings.

Abstract: We develop a reduction-based framework for online learning with delayed feedback that recovers and improves upon existing results for both first-order and bandit convex optimization. Our approach introduces a continuous-time model under which regret decomposes into a delay-independent learning term and a delay-induced drift term, yielding a delay-adaptive reduction that converts any algorithm for online linear optimization into one that handles round-dependent delays. For bandit convex optimization, we significantly improve existing regret bounds, with delay-dependent terms matching state-of-the-art first-order rates. For first-order feedback, we recover state-of-the-art regret bounds via a simpler, unified analysis. Quantitatively, for bandit convex optimization we obtain $O(\sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}} + T^{\frac{3}{4}}\sqrt{k})$ regret, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(\min\{\sqrt{T d_{\text{max}}},(Td_{\text{tot}})^{\frac{1}{3}}\})$ in previous work to $O(\sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}})$. Here, $k$, $T$, $d_{\text{max}}$, and $d_{\text{tot}}$ denote the dimension, time horizon, maximum delay, and total delay, respectively. Under strong convexity, we achieve $O(\min\{σ_{\text{max}} \ln T, \sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}}\} + (T^2\ln T)^{\frac{1}{3}} {k}^{\frac{2}{3}})$, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(d_{\text{max}} \ln T)$ in previous work to $O(\min\{σ_{\text{max}} \ln T, \sqrt{d_{\text{tot}}}\})$, where $σ_{\text{max}}$ denotes the maximum number of outstanding observations and may be considerably smaller than $d_{\text{max}}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of high-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data by developing two novel spatially regularized methods, Spatial NMF (SNMF) and Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which significantly improve clustering performance and biological coherence in single-cell image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of analyzing high-dimensional data from high-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms like Xenium, which require effective methods for representation learning and clustering to handle complex biological and spatial contexts.

Method: The paper introduces two methods: SNMF, which enforces spatial smoothness by diffusing cell factor vectors, and hSNMF, which integrates spatial and transcriptomic similarities through hybrid adjacency and Leiden clustering with a tunable parameter alpha.

Result: The methods (SNMF and hSNMF) outperform other spatial baselines in spatial compactness, cluster separability, and biological coherence, as demonstrated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset.

Conclusion: SNMF and hSNMF effectively address challenges in spatial transcriptomics data analysis, delivering improved clustering performance and higher biological relevance for single-cell imaging and transcriptomics studies.

Abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms, such as Xenium, generate single-cell images that capture both molecular and spatial context, but their extremely high dimensionality poses major challenges for representation learning and clustering. In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARA introduces a modular attention mechanism improving the geometric flexibility and accuracy of machine learning force fields for atomistic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning force fields often rely on fixed angular expansions, limiting their geometric flexibility and interactions.

Method: MARA builds upon spherical attention, adapted for molecular SE(3) tasks, to provide flexible modular weighting of local environments through angular and radial coordinates.

Result: MARA enhances energy and force predictions, reduces errors, and improves the robustness of atomistic models across molecular benchmarks.

Conclusion: Continuous spherical attention via MARA enhances expressiveness, stability, and reliability in atomistic modeling, providing a generalizable geometric operator.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have become essential for accurate and efficient atomistic modeling. Despite their high accuracy, most existing approaches rely on fixed angular expansions, limiting flexibility in weighting local geometric interactions. We introduce Modular Angular-Radial Attention (MARA), a module that extends spherical attention -- originally developed for SO(3) tasks -- to the molecular domain and SE(3), providing an efficient approximation of equivariant interactions. MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments. Unlike existing attention mechanisms in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, MARA can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner into models such as MACE without architectural modifications. Across molecular benchmarks, MARA improves energy and force predictions, reduces high-error events, and enhances robustness. These results demonstrate that continuous spherical attention is an effective and generalizable geometric operator that increases the expressiveness, stability, and reliability of atomistic models.

*Riccardo Zaccone,Stefanos Laskaridis,Marco Ciccone,Samuel Horváth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexRank introduces a method to adaptively deploy pretrained deep neural networks at variable computational costs by extracting nested submodels using low-rank weight decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to adaptively deploy large deep neural networks, such as LLMs and ViTs, to varying computational budgets due to their high training and deployment costs.

Method: FlexRank utilizes low-rank weight decomposition and importance-based nested consolidation to create scalable submodels from pretrained networks that adapt to different cost budgets.

Result: FlexRank provides a framework to achieve a tradeoff between computational cost and model performance, enabling adaptive deployment without needing to retrain models for each specific computational budget.

Conclusion: The method allows practical deployment of large pretrained models across diverse environments, supporting the "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm while optimizing cost-performance balance.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep neural networks, encompassing large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has made training from scratch prohibitively expensive and deployment increasingly costly. These models are often used as computational monoliths with fixed cost, a rigidity that does not leverage overparametrized architectures and largely hinders adaptive deployment across different cost budgets. We argue that importance-ordered nested components can be extracted from pretrained models, and selectively activated on the available computational budget. To this end, our proposed FlexRank method leverages low-rank weight decomposition with nested, importance-based consolidation to extract submodels of increasing capabilities. Our approach enables a "train-once, deploy-everywhere" paradigm that offers a graceful trade-off between cost and performance without training from scratch for each budget - advancing practical deployment of large models.

### [350] [Expert-Data Alignment Governs Generation Quality in Decentralized Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02685)
*Marcos Villagra,Bidhan Roy,Raihan Seraj,Zhiying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the generation quality in Decentralized Diffusion Models (DDMs) and discovers that expert-data alignment significantly impacts generation quality, contrary to initial assumptions about stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand what governs the generation quality in Decentralized Diffusion Models, especially in scenarios with disjoint data clusters and independent experts, due to observed disagreement among predictions.

Method: The authors systematically test hypotheses through comparative analyses of sampling dynamics and numerical stability, alongside data-cluster distance analysis and expert disagreement evaluations in DDM systems.

Result: Sparse Top-2 routing with data-aligned experts significantly improves generation quality (FID 22.6), while full ensemble routing worsens it (FID 47.9), despite better stability metrics. Experts aligned closely with their training data clusters consistently produce better predictions.

Conclusion: Expert-data alignment is more crucial for guiding routing strategies in DDMs than numerical stability, demonstrating that quality deteriorates with expert disagreements and misalignment.

Abstract: Decentralized Diffusion Models (DDMs) route denoising through experts trained independently on disjoint data clusters, which can strongly disagree in their predictions. What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics.

*Wenshuai Zhao,Zhiyuan Li,Yi Zhao,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Martin Trapp,Joni Pajarinen,Juho Kannala,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a masking strategy for improving diffusion models by training them with only sparsely supervised data, which leads to better global consistency in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models, despite their success in generative tasks, face issues with spatial inconsistency because of the local nature of their denoising processes.

Method: The authors introduce a masking strategy during training, where up to 98% of pixels are masked, enabling diffusion models to avoid overfitting and forcing them to rely on contextual cues.

Result: Their experiments demonstrate that the method achieves competitive FID scores, reduces training instability on small datasets, and decreases memorization.

Conclusion: The proposed sparsely supervised learning enhances diffusion models by promoting global consistency and using essential contextual information effectively, with minimal changes required to the existing training frameworks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. However, they often suffer from spatially inconsistent generation, arguably due to the inherent locality of their denoising mechanisms. This can yield samples that are locally plausible but globally inconsistent. To mitigate this issue, we propose sparsely supervised learning for diffusion models, a simple yet effective masking strategy that can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Interestingly, the experiments show that it is safe to mask up to 98\% of pixels during diffusion model training. Our method delivers competitive FID scores across experiments and, most importantly, avoids training instability on small datasets. Moreover, the masking strategy reduces memorization and promotes the use of essential contextual information during generation.

*Sayak Chakrabarti,Toniann Pitassi,Josh Alman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how quantization impacts Transformer expressivity, showing that reducing precision undermines specific computations like equality comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is widely used for inference acceleration, but its effect on Transformer expressivity is not well understood. This research aims to characterize this tradeoff theoretically.

Method: The study uses mathematical proofs combining finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds to determine expressivity limits based on bit precision.

Result: The authors prove that precise tasks (like equality comparisons) are highly sensitive to quantization—dropping one bit in precision can make certain tasks impossible.

Conclusion: The findings guide practitioners to calibrate quantization levels, emphasizing the need for adequate precision in tasks requiring equality comparisons to preserve model reliability.

Abstract: Quantization reduces the numerical precision of Transformer computations and is widely used to accelerate inference, yet its effect on expressivity remains poorly characterized. We demonstrate a fine-grained theoretical tradeoff between expressivity and precision: For every p we exhibit a function Γ, inspired by the equality function, and prove that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute Γ, with p bits of precision, but not with p-1 bits of precision.
  This result concretely explains the widely observed phenomenon of empirical loss of expressivity when quantization is used. Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.
  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight "one-bit" threshold.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BinaryPPO, a method that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem using offline reinforcement learning, offering improved accuracy over supervised approaches in noisy and imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles with label noise, class imbalance, and sparse supervision in real-world binary classification tasks.

Method: The proposed BinaryPPO method uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function to penalize uncertain or incorrect predictions, learning robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction.

Result: BinaryPPO improves binary classification accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, across eight domain-specific benchmarks and different model architectures.

Conclusion: Confidence-based reward design, as implemented in BinaryPPO, is a robust alternative to supervised fine-tuning for binary classification, particularly in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for binary classification tasks such as toxicity detection, factuality verification, and causal inference. However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines. We provide an in-depth analysis of the role of reward shaping, advantage scaling, and policy stability in enabling this improvement. Overall, we demonstrate that confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification. Our code is available at https://github.com/psyonp/BinaryPPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a framework approximating maximum likelihood in sampling-based setups, achieving efficient results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning fails to directly maximize likelihood in scenarios with binary outcome feedback, necessitating an improved approach.

Method: Introduces MaxRL, which uses compute-indexed sample-based objectives interpolating between reinforcement learning and maximum likelihood. It includes an unbiased policy-gradient estimator.

Result: MaxRL showed test-time scaling efficiency up to 20 times better than GRPO-trained models and demonstrated better data and compute scaling.

Conclusion: MaxRL is a promising framework for improving reinforcement learning in binary-outcome setups, providing better scaling and accuracy.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is the method of choice to train models in sampling-based setups with binary outcome feedback, such as navigation, code generation, and mathematical problem solving. In such settings, models implicitly induce a likelihood over correct rollouts. However, we observe that reinforcement learning does not maximize this likelihood, and instead optimizes only a lower-order approximation. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a sampling-based framework to approximate maximum likelihood using reinforcement learning techniques. MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated. The resulting objectives admit a simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimator and converge to maximum likelihood optimization in the infinite-compute limit. Empirically, we show that MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods in all models and tasks we tested, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to its GRPO-trained counterpart. We also observe MaxRL to scale better with additional data and compute. Our results suggest MaxRL is a promising framework for scaling RL training in correctness based settings.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical foundations and effects of steering intermediate representations in large language models, particularly focusing on the steering strength's impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many methods enable steering LLMs via intermediate representations, but the guidelines for setting steering strength are unclear. Finding the optimal magnitude is crucial to balancing model performance and desired behavior.

Method: The authors conduct the first theoretical analysis exploring how steering strength impacts the model's next-token probabilities, concept presence, and cross-entropy. They develop governing qualitative laws and perform empirical validation on eleven language models.

Result: The study identifies non-monotonic behaviors in steering strength’s effects and provides precise quantitative insights. These theoretical predictions were validated across diverse LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Understanding steering strength is crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without degradation. Empirical results support theoretical findings, offering important guidance for advanced LLM manipulation.

Abstract: A popular approach to post-training control of large language models (LLMs) is the steering of intermediate latent representations. Namely, identify a well-chosen direction depending on the task at hand and perturbs representations along this direction at inference time. While many propositions exist to pick this direction, considerably less is understood about how to choose the magnitude of the move, whereas its importance is clear: too little and the intended behavior does not emerge, too much and the model's performance degrades beyond repair. In this work, we propose the first theoretical analysis of steering strength. We characterize its effect on next token probability, presence of a concept, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities. Our analysis reveals surprising behaviors, including non-monotonic effects of steering strength. We validate our theoretical predictions empirically on eleven language models, ranging from a small GPT architecture to modern models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods for dysphagia are invasive or rely on radiographic imaging, underscoring the need for a portable, noninvasive, and scalable alternative.

Method: The authors propose a framework employing portable acoustic sensing to capture neck signals during swallowing and leverage applied machine learning to detect dysphagia patterns.

Result: With an achieved AUC-ROC of 0.904 over 5 independent train-test splits, the method demonstrates promising efficiency in abnormality detection.

Conclusion: Noninvasive acoustic sensing presents a viable, scalable option for monitoring pharyngeal health and enabling early dysphagia detection.

Abstract: Pharyngeal health plays a vital role in essential human functions such as breathing, swallowing, and vocalization. Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive acoustic sensing as a practical and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which portions of deep learning models' hidden semantic representations contribute to their predictions and address the inefficiencies of existing clustering methods for concept-based explanations.

Method: The authors propose the Vector Quantized Latent Concept (VQLC) framework founded on VQ-VAE architecture, which maps continuous representations into discrete, human-interpretable concept vectors through a learned codebook.

Result: The evaluations demonstrated that VQLC improves scalability in clustering token representations while providing explanations that are of comparable quality to existing methods such as hierarchical clustering.

Conclusion: VQLC offers a scalable and effective approach for generating human-understandable explanations of deep learning models' decision-making processes, overcoming the limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Deep Learning models encode rich semantic information in their hidden representations. However, it remains challenging to understand which parts of this information models actually rely on when making predictions. A promising line of post-hoc concept-based explanation methods relies on clustering token representations. However, commonly used approaches such as hierarchical clustering are computationally infeasible for large-scale datasets, and K-Means often yields shallow or frequency-dominated clusters. We propose the vector quantized latent concept (VQLC) method, a framework built upon the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture that learns a discrete codebook mapping continuous representations to concept vectors. We perform thorough evaluations and show that VQLC improves scalability while maintaining comparable quality of human-understandable explanations.

Conclusion: RLAnything successfully strengthens reinforcement learning systems by leveraging optimized feedback mechanisms and environment adaptation, enhancing both policy training and reward modeling for LLM applications.

Abstract: We propose RLAnything, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically forges environment, policy, and reward models through closed-loop optimization, amplifying learning signals and strengthening the overall RL system for any LLM or agentic scenarios. Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively. We also that optimized reward-model signals outperform outcomes that rely on human labels. Code: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL

*Huu Binh Ta,Michael Cardei,Alvaro Velasquez,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Search-Augmented Masked Diffusion (SearchDiff) integrates informed search into the denoising process, improving sampling for structured and symbolic generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of standard discrete diffusion models, which lack mechanisms for enforcing hard constraints or optimizing non-differentiable properties during inference.

Method: SearchDiff integrates informed search into the reverse denoising process of diffusion models, modifying the reverse transitions based on user-defined property satisfaction.

Result: Experiments in biological design and symbolic reasoning demonstrate improved constraint satisfaction and adherence to properties, outperforming both diffusion and autoregressive baselines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel neurosymbolic inference approach for better constraint handling and optimization in sequence generation tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models generate sequences by iteratively denoising samples corrupted by categorical noise, offering an appealing alternative to autoregressive decoding for structured and symbolic generation. However, standard training targets a likelihood-based objective that primarily matches the data distribution and provides no native mechanism for enforcing hard constraints or optimizing non-differentiable properties at inference time. This work addresses this limitation and introduces Search-Augmented Masked Diffusion (SearchDiff), a training-free neurosymbolic inference framework that integrates informed search directly into the reverse denoising process. At each denoising step, the model predictions define a proposal set that is optimized under a user-specified property satisfaction, yielding a modified reverse transition that steers sampling toward probable and feasible solutions. Experiments in biological design and symbolic reasoning illustrate that SearchDiff substantially improves constraint satisfaction and property adherence, while consistently outperforming discrete diffusion and autoregressive baselines.

*Viresh Pati,Yubin Kim,Vinh Pham,Jevon Twitty,Shihao Yang,Jiecheng Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CAPS, a novel attention mechanism for time series forecasting, addressing global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the forecasting of time series data by addressing distinct temporal structures like trends, shocks, and seasonality, which are not effectively managed by existing methods.

Method: CAPS uses SO(2) rotations for phase alignment, additive gating paths (Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, Clock), and the Clock mechanism for temporal weighting within an attention layer.

Result: CAPS outperforms vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and shows competitive performance against seven strong baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CAPS framework effectively decouples complex temporal structures in forecasting tasks with linear complexity, enhancing prediction accuracy and flexibility.

Abstract: This paper presents $\textbf{CAPS}$ (Clock-weighted Aggregation with Prefix-products and Softmax), a structured attention mechanism for time series forecasting that decouples three distinct temporal structures: global trends, local shocks, and seasonal patterns. Standard softmax attention entangles these through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths -- Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline -- within a single attention layer. We introduce the Clock mechanism, a learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance. Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks surpass vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrate competitive performance against seven strong baselines with linear complexity. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/vireshpati/CAPS-Attention.

*Ke Wang,Yifan Tang,Nguyen Gia Hien Vu,Faez Ahmed,G. Gary Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot generative framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, which facilitates design generation with minimal data and computation, achieving competitive results without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for engineering design are often impractical due to high computational costs and the need for large datasets and frequent retraining with changing requirements.

Method: The proposed method uses TabPFN to enable conditional design generation sequentially, requiring limited reference samples and no task-specific training or fine-tuning.

Result: The framework is successfully evaluated on three datasets (ship hull designs, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil), showcasing low errors in performance, resistant adaption to variation, and lower computational overhead compared to diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: Zero-shot, data-efficient generation provides a practical alternative for parametric engineering design, allowing for fast deployment, adaptability, and reduced resource demand in real-world settings.

Abstract: Deep generative models for engineering design often require substantial computational cost, large training datasets, and extensive retraining when design requirements or datasets change, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering design workflow. In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows.

*Arjun Roy,Prajna G. Malettira,Manish Nagaraj,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoPrune introduces a stable, topology-based data pruning method that is robust to noise and transferable across architectures, achieving high precision and accuracy with significant dataset reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric data pruning methods are unstable due to reliance on extrinsic geometry, degrading performance with feature noise or cross-architecture transfers.

Method: The framework operates at two scales: (1) applying a topology-aware manifold approximation for a global embedding, and (2) using differentiable persistent homology for local optimization, prioritizing samples by structural complexity.

Result: TopoPrune ensures high accuracy even at large pruning rates (e.g., 90%), is robust against noise perturbations, and exhibits superior cross-architecture transferability.

Conclusion: TopoPrune offers a stable, topology-driven solution for data-efficient learning, overcoming limitations of traditional geometric pruning methods.

Abstract: Geometric data pruning methods, while practical for leveraging pretrained models, are fundamentally unstable. Their reliance on extrinsic geometry renders them highly sensitive to latent space perturbations, causing performance to degrade during cross-architecture transfer or in the presence of feature noise. We introduce TopoPrune, a framework which resolves this challenge by leveraging topology to capture the stable, intrinsic structure of data. TopoPrune operates at two scales, (1) utilizing a topology-aware manifold approximation to establish a global low-dimensional embedding of the dataset. Subsequently, (2) it employs differentiable persistent homology to perform a local topological optimization on the manifold embeddings, ranking samples by their structural complexity. We demonstrate that our unified dual-scale topological approach ensures high accuracy and precision, particularly at significant dataset pruning rates (e.g., 90%). Furthermore, through the inherent stability properties of topology, TopoPrune is (a) exceptionally robust to noise perturbations of latent feature embeddings and (b) demonstrates superior transferability across diverse network architectures. This study demonstrates a promising avenue towards stable and principled topology-based frameworks for robust data-efficient learning.

*Zihao Jing,Qiuhao Zeng,Ruiyi Fang,Yan Sun,Boyu Wang,Pingzhao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDT-Former, a method for improving molecular graph understanding using dynamic token generation, which avoids fine-tuning costly LLM backbones and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with molecular graphs due to limitations in current graph-LLM bridges that use Q-Former-style connectors (designed for vision tasks) and lack stereochemical and substructural context.

Method: The researchers developed EDT-Former, a model employing entropy-guided dynamic tokens aligned with molecular patches to preserve local and global molecular structures, aligning frozen graph encoders with LLMs without LLM backbone fine-tuning.

Result: EDT-Former achieved computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeQA, Mol-Instructions, TDC, and MoleculeNet benchmarks for molecular understanding.

Conclusion: EDT-Former improves scalability and generalization in multimodal molecular understanding through efficient and effective alignment of molecular graphs with LLMs.

Abstract: Molecular understanding is central to advancing areas such as scientific discovery, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand molecular graphs effectively. Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks. These designs overlook stereochemistry and substructural context and typically require costly LLM-backbone fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and generalization. We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding

### [365] [On the Sample Efficiency of Inverse Dynamics Models for Semi-Supervised Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02762)
*Sacha Morin,Moonsub Byeon,Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau,Sébastien Lachapelle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses semi-supervised imitation learning, analyzing inverse dynamics models (IDM) and their applications like VM-IDM and IDM labeling, identifying key advantages and proposing improvements to an existing algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance policy learning by improving sample efficiency in semi-supervised imitation learning, leveraging IDM's inherent advantages.

Method: The paper investigates IDM learning in SSIL by analyzing properties via statistical learning theory, conducting novel experiments, and refining the LAPO algorithm.

Result: Findings reveal superior sample efficiency in IDM-based policies compared to behavior cloning and demonstrate the advantages using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction.

Conclusion: IDM-based policy learning offers improved efficiency compared to standard approaches, and the proposed refinements enhance latent action policy learning in SSIL frameworks.

Abstract: Semi-supervised imitation learning (SSIL) consists in learning a policy from a small dataset of action-labeled trajectories and a much larger dataset of action-free trajectories. Some SSIL methods learn an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to predict the action from the current state and the next state. An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA). Motivated by these insights, we finally propose an improved version of the existing LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning.

### [366] [Exposing Vulnerabilities in Explanation for Time Series Classifiers via Dual-Target Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02763)
*Bohan Wang,Zewen Liu,Lu Lin,Hui Liu,Li Xiong,Ming Jin,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights the vulnerability of interpretability in time series deep learning systems by introducing TSEF, which achieves targeted misclassification without disrupting explanation consistency, revealing explanation stability is not a reliable robustness indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the over-reliance on explanation stability as a proxy for robustness in interpretable time series deep learning systems, which can be misleading and exploited adversarially.

Method: The authors developed TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack method, to manipulate both classifier and explainer outputs, achieving misclassification while maintaining plausible and consistent explanations.

Result: The study demonstrates that explanations can remain stable and consistent even when targeted misclassifications occur, thereby challenging the reliability of explanation stability as a robustness indicator.

Conclusion: Explanation stability should not be used as a standalone measure of robustness in time series tasks. Coupling-aware robustness evaluation methods must be incorporated for more trustworthy analysis.

Abstract: Interpretable time series deep learning systems are often assessed by checking temporal consistency on explanations, implicitly treating this as evidence of robustness. We show that this assumption can fail: Predictions and explanations can be adversarially decoupled, enabling targeted misclassification while the explanation remains plausible and consistent with a chosen reference rationale. We propose TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack that jointly manipulates the classifier and explainer outputs. In contrast to single-objective misclassification attacks that disrupt explanation and spread attribution mass broadly, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with the reference. Across multiple datasets and explainer backbones, our results consistently reveal that explanation stability is a misleading proxy for decision robustness and motivate coupling-aware robustness evaluations for trustworthy time series tasks.

### [367] [Privately Fine-Tuned LLMs Preserve Temporal Dynamics in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02766)
*Lucas Rosenblatt,Peihan Liu,Ryan McKenna,Natalia Ponomareva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PATH, a generative framework for creating differentially private synthetic longitudinal tabular data using fine-tuned language models, outperforming existing methods in preserving temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on private synthetic tabular data primarily assumes independent rows and overlooks the temporal aspects of longitudinal datasets, such as in electronic health records. Flattening data for marginal-based methods fails to maintain necessary temporal coherence.

Method: PATH treats entire longitudinal tables as the synthesis unit and employs the autoregressive capabilities of differentially private, fine-tuned large language models for generating data.

Result: PATH improves preservation of long-range temporal dependencies, reducing distributional distance by over 60% and state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to traditional marginal-based methods, while maintaining similar marginal fidelity.

Conclusion: The PATH framework effectively addresses the deficits of conventional approaches for synthesizing longitudinal datasets by leveraging advanced language model capabilities, making it superior for preserving complex temporal structures.

Abstract: Research on differentially private synthetic tabular data has largely focused on independent and identically distributed rows where each record corresponds to a unique individual. This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.

*Meng Ding,Jinhui Xu,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies full data-replay in continual learning, offering a theoretical framework to understand its effectiveness and identifying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as critical to preventing forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, focusing on the relatively unexplored theoretical underpinnings of full data-replay approaches.

Method: The authors analyze continual learning from a feature learning perspective, using a multi-view data model, and validate their findings through synthetic and real-world experiments.

Result: They identify that forgetting occurs under full replay if noise dominates signals, while sufficient signal accumulation enables recovery of earlier tasks. Moreover, task ordering that prioritizes high-signals aids learning and prevents forgetting.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for full data-replay in continual learning, highlighting the importance of SNR and task ordering in mitigating forgetting and promoting effective learning.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models on a sequence of tasks while retaining performance on previously learned ones. A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes.

*Saurav Raj Pandey,Harlin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BTCNet is a self-supervised multimodal learning framework for analyzing long physiological recordings, particularly in sleep studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing methods that treat short segments of physiological data independently and lack incorporation of the temporal and signal-interaction context.

Method: BTCNet incorporates segment timing within entire recordings and utilizes cross-attention to learn pairwise interactions among physiological signals, all in a self-supervised manner.

Result: BTCNet outperformed its non-time-aware variant and existing multimodal models for multiple pediatric sleep-related tasks, with notable gains in respiration-related tasks.

Conclusion: BTCNet is effective for long physiological recordings and achieves strong performance across varied tasks with sleep-related data, highlighting its utility in improving sleep analysis models.

Abstract: We present BiTimeCrossNet (BTCNet), a multimodal self-supervised learning framework for long physiological recordings such as overnight sleep studies. While many existing approaches train on short segments treated as independent samples, BTCNet incorporates information about when each segment occurs within its parent recording, for example within a sleep session. BTCNet further learns pairwise interactions between physiological signals via cross-attention, without requiring task labels or sequence-level supervision.
  We evaluate BTCNet on pediatric sleep data across six downstream tasks, including sleep staging, arousal detection, and respiratory event detection. Under frozen-backbone linear probing, BTCNet consistently outperforms an otherwise identical non-time-aware variant, with gains that generalize to an independent pediatric dataset. Compared to existing multimodal self-supervised sleep models, BTCNet achieves strong performance, particularly on respiration-related tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates ECG biometrics for individual identification, revealing strong privacy risks even in anonymized data, with embedding-based models significantly enhancing re-identification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of ECG data to uniquely identify individuals and the consequent privacy risks of utilizing such biometrics in real-world systems.

Method: Analyzed ECG data through fiducial features and embedding-based deep learning models (e.g., ArcFace), comparing tabular input and waveform approaches, and evaluated performance on a large-scale test set using metrics such as TAR, FAR, EER, and DIR.

Result: Embedding-based models showed enhanced performance, achieving high TAR at strict FAR thresholds and strong closed/open-set identification. Re-identification was effective, especially when using waveforms and large training sets.

Conclusion: ECG inherently carries individual identity information, compromising privacy even with anonymization. More robust privacy measures and operational protocols are needed to safeguard biometric data usage.

Abstract: This work studies electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics at large scale, evaluating how strongly an ECG can be linked to an individual and, consequently, how its anonymization may be compromised. We show that identity information is already present in tabular representations (fiducial features): even a simple MLP-based embedding network yields non-trivial performance, indicating that anonymization based solely on releasing features does not guarantee privacy. We then adopt embedding-based deep learning models (ArcFace), first on features and then on ECG waveforms, showing a performance jump when moving from tabular inputs to waveforms, and a further gain with larger training sets and consistent normalization across train/val/test. On a large-scale test set, verification achieves high TAR at strict FAR thresholds (TAR=0.908 @ FAR=1e-3; TAR=0.820 @ FAR=1e-4) with EER=2.53% (all-vs-all); closed-set identification yields Rank@1=0.812 and Rank@10=0.910. In open-set, a two-stage pipeline (top-K shortlist on embeddings + re-ranking) reaches DIR@FAR up to 0.976 at FAR=1e-3 and 1e-4. Overall, the results show that ECG carries a measurable individual signature: re-identification is already possible with tabular features and is further amplified by embedding-based models, making privacy implications and realistic operational protocols essential to consider.

*Arian Khorasani,Théophile Demazure*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF) module for multimodal affect modeling, handling asynchrony in EEG and physiology efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling asynchronous EEG and peripheral physiological data in multimodal affect analysis, as existing methods often overlook this or rely on computationally expensive warping methods.

Method: CTAF uses soft bidirectional alignments, a time-aware cross-attention mechanism, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives, optionally with weak supervision, to fuse modalities.

Result: CTAF improves cosine margins for matched pairs, enhances cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and competes with baselines on classification metrics (accuracy and macro-F1) while requiring fewer labels.

Conclusion: CTAF offers a label-efficient and generalizable solution for EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony, demonstrating its utility in psychophysiological time series by modeling central and autonomic nervous system coupling.

Abstract: We study multimodal affect modeling when EEG and peripheral physiology are asynchronous, which most fusion methods ignore or handle with costly warping. We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.

TL;DR: LEMON is a model-agnostic framework for explaining multimodal predictions that is efficient and faithful, offering unified explanations across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models lack explainability methods that are efficient, architecture-independent, and scalable.

Method: LEMON utilizes a modality-aware surrogate model with group-structured sparsity to produce explanations, treating predictors as black boxes and optimizing computational efficiency.

Result: LEMON is evaluated on diverse tasks, achieving competitive faithfulness while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to baselines.

Conclusion: LEMON provides interpretable multimodal explanations with improved computational efficiency, making it suitable for scalable applications.

Abstract: Multimodal models are ubiquitous, yet existing explainability methods are often single-modal, architecture-dependent, or too computationally expensive to run at scale. We introduce LEMON (Local Explanations via Modality-aware OptimizatioN), a model-agnostic framework for local explanations of multimodal predictions. LEMON fits a single modality-aware surrogate with group-structured sparsity to produce unified explanations that disentangle modality-level contributions and feature-level attributions. The approach treats the predictor as a black box and is computationally efficient, requiring relatively few forward passes while remaining faithful under repeated perturbations. We evaluate LEMON on vision-language question answering and a clinical prediction task with image, text, and tabular inputs, comparing against representative multimodal baselines. Across backbones, LEMON achieves competitive deletion-based faithfulness while reducing black-box evaluations by 35-67 times and runtime by 2-8 times compared to strong multimodal baselines.

Motivation: Achieving real-time, accurate solutions for PDEs that generalize well to unseen geometries while maintaining physical conservation laws.

Method: The study introduces Geo-NeW, a data-driven method that combines mesh-based transformer encodings with learned finite element spaces using Finite Element Exterior Calculus principles.

Result: Geo-NeW achieves state-of-the-art results on steady-state PDE benchmarks and significantly outperforms conventional methods on unseen geometries.

Conclusion: Geo-NeW effectively links geometry, boundary conditions, and PDE solutions, offering an innovative approach to enhance generalization in neural PDE methods.

Abstract: We aim to develop physics foundation models for science and engineering that provide real-time solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which preserve structure and accuracy under adaptation to unseen geometries. To this end, we introduce General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven finite element method. We jointly learn a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces defined on the underlying geometry. The resulting model is solved to generate predictions, while exactly preserving physical conservation laws through Finite Element Exterior Calculus. Geometry enters the model as a discretized mesh both through a transformer-based encoding and as the basis for the learned finite element spaces. This explicitly connects the underlying geometry and imposed boundary conditions to the solution, providing a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs, which we demonstrate improves generalization to unseen domains. We provide a novel parameterization of the constitutive model ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks, and provides a significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.

TL;DR: The paper examines the propagation of small latent perturbations in flow matching and employs Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) as a tool for understanding dependency structures in features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how small latent perturbations propagate through flows and use JVPs to understand feature dependencies in generated data.

Method: The authors derive closed-form expressions for optimal drifts and Jacobians in Gaussian and mixture-of-Gaussian setups, validate analytical Jacobians using numerical JVPs on low-dimensional benchmarks, and use an attribute classifier combined with flows to analyze feature correlations.

Result: JVP estimators successfully recover empirical correlations in image domains like MNIST and CelebA. Additionally, conditioning on classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations in line with common-cause hypotheses.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of JVPs for understanding feature dependencies in flows and suggests a correlation reduction technique, though it is not equivalent to formal interventions.

Abstract: Flow matching learns a velocity field that transports a base distribution to data. We study how small latent perturbations propagate through these flows and show that Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) provide a practical lens on dependency structure in the generated features. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal drift and its Jacobian in Gaussian and mixture-of-Gaussian settings, revealing that even globally nonlinear flows admit local affine structure. In low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks, numerical JVPs recover the analytical Jacobians. In image domains, composing the flow with an attribute classifier yields an attribute-level JVP estimator that recovers empirical correlations on MNIST and CelebA. Conditioning on small classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations in a way consistent with a hypothesized common-cause structure, while we emphasize that this conditioning is not a formal do intervention.

Conclusion: AgentOWL offers a significant advancement in hierarchical reinforcement learning, achieving efficient skill acquisition through simultaneous learning of abstract models and options.

Abstract: Building agents that can perform new skills by composing existing skills is a long-standing goal of AI agent research. Towards this end, we investigate how to efficiently acquire a sequence of skills, formalized as hierarchical neural options. However, existing model-free hierarchical reinforcement algorithms need a lot of data. We propose a novel method, which we call AgentOWL (Option and World model Learning Agent), that jointly learns -- in a sample efficient way -- an abstract world model (abstracting across both states and time) and a set of hierarchical neural options. We show, on a subset of Object-Centric Atari games, that our method can learn more skills using much less data than baseline methods.

*Michael Ogezi,Martin Bell,Freda Shi,Ethan Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continuous Number Modeling (CNM) to improve SVG-based image generation tasks, speeding training by over 30% and achieving better visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics, such as SVGs, offer benefits like flexibility and editing ease, but their numerical parameters are poorly encoded using token-based methods, which slow training and harm accuracy.

Method: The authors propose CNM, a method to model numbers as continuous values instead of discrete tokens. They then train a multimodal transformer and fine-tune it with reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback.

Result: CNM achieves a 30% faster training speed and enhances perceptual fidelity in SVG generation compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates CNM as an efficient method for high-quality vector graphic generation, presenting broader application potential and sharing their code for community use.

Abstract: For certain image generation tasks, vector graphics such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) offer clear benefits such as increased flexibility, size efficiency, and editing ease, but remain less explored than raster-based approaches. A core challenge is that the numerical, geometric parameters, which make up a large proportion of SVGs, are inefficiently encoded as long sequences of tokens. This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding. We then train a multimodal transformer on 2 million raster-to-SVG samples, followed by fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback to further improve visual quality. Our approach improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches. This work establishes CNM as a practical and efficient approach for high-quality vector generation, with potential for broader applications. We make our code available http://github.com/mikeogezi/CNM.

### [377] [A Single Revision Step Improves Token-Efficient LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02828)
*Yingchuan Zhang,Terry Ma,Wenxuan Zhong,Ping Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACER, a reasoning framework enabling LLM-produced traces to collaboratively revise conclusions to improve challenging task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reasoning trace aggregation methods fail due to isolated evaluation and susceptibility to misleading high-confidence hallucinated paths.

Method: PACER uses a training-free, inference-only approach with a structured coordination step, integrating consensus packets and self-reviews for trace revision.

Result: PACER matches or exceeds the performance of 256-sample majority voting on competitive math tasks, improving over raw ensemble methods.

Conclusion: Transforming simple consensus into collaborative logical refinement enhances reasoning task accuracy without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve higher accuracy on challenging reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute through multiple trajectory sampling. However, standard aggregation methods like majority voting or individual confidence-based filtering face a fundamental "blind spot": they evaluate each trace in isolation. As problems scale in difficulty, models often generate hallucinated paths that exhibit misleadingly high confidence, causing the true solution to be suppressed by a narrow margin in traditional voting. We ask: can we enable traces to "peer-review" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?
  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer. Individual traces then perform a targeted self-review conditioned on this packet, allowing them to identify specific logical junctions where they diverged from the broader consensus and pivot if their original reasoning is found to be flawed. Final predictions are obtained via confidence-weighted voting over these revised trajectories. On challenging competitive math benchmarks such as AIME and BRUMO, PACER matches or exceeds the accuracy of 256-sample majority voting, significantly outperforming raw ensemble baselines by transforming simple consensus into a collaborative logical refinement process.

*Sourajit Das,Dibyajyoti Chakraborthy,Romit Maulik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SC3D, a differentiable framework for discovering causal structures from multivariate time series with improved stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of discovering causal relationships from multivariate time series, which involves complex multivariate interactions across different lags and often has large combinatorial search spaces.

Method: The SC3D framework incorporates a two-stage process: Stage 1 preselects edges using node-wise prediction to generate masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, and Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing likelihood while enforcing sparsity and acyclicity conditions.

Result: SC3D demonstrated enhanced stability and improved recovery accuracy for both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing methods in experiments using synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems.

Conclusion: SC3D effectively discovers both lagged and instantaneous causal structures in multivariate time series, providing a reliable and accurate approach for this complex problem.

Abstract: Discovering causal structures from multivariate time series is a key problem because interactions span across multiple lags and possibly involve instantaneous dependencies. Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.

*Rares Grozavescu,Pengyu Zhang,Etienne Meunier,Mark Girolami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continuous-time Koopman framework to improve surrogate models for simulating turbulent flows, enhancing prediction stability, accuracy, and extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate models for simulating turbulent flows often face challenges balancing short-term accuracy and long-term stability, especially in discrete-time settings.

Method: The authors propose a continuous-time Koopman framework that uses numerical integration schemes for latent space evolution, with variable timesteps for robust and generalized forecasting.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy, long-horizon stability, and extrapolation capabilities, evaluated on classical CFD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The continuous-time Koopman framework advances surrogate modeling by offering flexible and stable latent space evolution, marking progress in turbulence simulation.

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating the simulation of turbulent flows. However, classical approaches which perform autoregressive rollouts often trade off between strong short-term accuracy and long-horizon stability. Koopman autoencoders, inspired by Koopman operator theory, provide a physics-based alternative by mapping nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted. In practice, most existing formulations operate in a discrete-time setting, limiting temporal flexibility. In this work, we introduce a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. By allowing variable timesteps at inference, the method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution and generalizes beyond training regimes. In addition, the learned dynamics closely adhere to the analytical matrix exponential solution, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting. We evaluate the approach on classical CFD benchmarks and report accuracy, stability, and extrapolation properties.

### [380] [Tabula RASA: Exposing and Breaking the Relational Bottleneck in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02834)
*Jonas Petersen,Camilla Mazzoleni,Riccardo Maggioni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RASA, a transformer modification for improved multi-hop relational reasoning, utilizing relational embeddings and sparse masking to enhance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with multi-hop relational reasoning tasks due to inherent depth requirements and structural limitations.

Method: The authors propose RASA, which incorporates edge-type embeddings and sparse masking to handle relational structure and limit attention space complexity.

Result: RASA achieves superior performance compared to standard transformers and matches GPT-4 on multi-hop reasoning tasks, with significant advantages at higher reasoning depths.

Conclusion: Minimal structural adjustments like RASA can enhance multi-hop reasoning in transformers, demonstrated through empirical success on relational reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance across many domains, yet struggle with tasks requiring multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data. We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and require $Ω(k)$ layers for $k$-hop reasoning. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal modification adding: (1) edge-type embeddings that inject relational structure into attention scores, and (2) sparse masking that restricts attention to graph-adjacent positions. While RASA has the same asymptotic depth requirements, sparse masking reduces the attention search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ patterns, and edge biases provide explicit relation routing. Empirically, on MetaQA (1/2/3-hop) and WebQuestionsSP, RASA outperforms standard transformers and matches GPT-4 at lower cost, with advantages growing with reasoning depth (+7.1 points on 3-hop). We do not claim formal learnability guarantees; the contribution is empirical validation that minimal structural modifications substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.

### [381] [Semantics-Aware Generative Latent Data Augmentation for Learning in Low-Resource Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02841)
*Jae-Sung Bae,Minje Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeLDA, a latent data augmentation method leveraging conditional diffusion models for improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning commonly underperforms in limited data regimes, despite its success in data-rich settings. This limitation persists even with foundation models during fine-tuning.

Method: The authors propose GeLDA, which uses semantics-aware generative models in a foundation model-induced low-dimensional latent space for high-quality data synthesis, conditioned on auxiliary semantic feature vectors.

Result: GeLDA improves performance in two tasks: (a) a 6.13% higher recall in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition; and (b) setting a state-of-the-art 74.7% accuracy for tail classes in ImageNet-LT classification.

Conclusion: GeLDA enhances data generation and downstream task performance in low-resource and imbalanced settings, leveraging semantic relationships for improved augmentation.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in data-rich regimes, deep learning often underperforms in the data-scarce settings common in practice. While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.

*Prajna G. Malettira,Manish Nagaraj,Arjun Roy,Shubham Negi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search framework for efficiently and effectively pruning large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient deployment of LLMs requires structured pruning. Existing pruning methods fail to capture complex global structural dependencies, and training-aware approaches are computationally costly.

Method: The authors introduced TraceNAS, which uses a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy to explore structured pruning of LLMs' depth and width without requiring training, while maintaining alignment with the pretrained model's loss landscape.

Result: TraceNAS can efficiently identify pruned models in 8.5 hours on a single GPU, significantly reducing the computational cost (10x less GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods) while maintaining competitive performance with baselines.

Conclusion: TraceNAS is an efficient and effective solution for structured pruning of LLMs, achieving competitive performance in commonsense and reasoning tasks with low computational cost.

Abstract: Structured pruning is essential for efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The varying sensitivity of LLM sub-blocks to pruning necessitates the identification of optimal non-uniformly pruned models. Existing methods evaluate the importance of layers, attention heads, or weight channels in isolation. Such localized focus ignores the complex global structural dependencies that exist across the model. Training-aware structured pruning addresses global dependencies, but its computational cost can be just as expensive as post-pruning training. To alleviate the computational burden of training-aware pruning and capture global structural dependencies, we propose TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. TraceNAS identifies pruned models that maintain a high degree of loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model using a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy, effectively selecting models that exhibit maximal performance potential during post-pruning training. TraceNAS is highly efficient, enabling high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, yielding a 10$\times$ reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that TraceNAS is competitive with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks.

### [383] [Zero Sum SVD: Balancing Loss Sensitivity for Low Rank LLM Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02848)
*Ali Abbasi,Chayne Thrash,Haoran Qin,Shansita Sharma,Sepehr Seifi,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Zero Sum SVD (ZS-SVD), a novel post-training compression method for large language models (LLMs) that optimizes low-rank approximations without expensive iterative computations. It reduces computational costs while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of high memory and compute costs associated with large language models and aims to improve upon current SVD-based compression techniques, which often lack adaptive rank allocation and require expensive optimization processes.

Method: ZS-SVD uses activation whitening with first-order calibration loss in whitened coordinates to globally prune singular components across the model, adhering to a zero-sum rule that predicts negligible cumulative loss. Additionally, it introduces a lightweight projected gradient correction post-truncation to further refine performance.

Result: ZS-SVD demonstrated consistent improvements in compression without significant loss of accuracy across various LLM architectures and benchmarks, validating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: ZS-SVD provides a globally optimized, adaptive, and computationally efficient approach to compressing large language models. The method maintains or improves performance while reducing memory and computational requirements. Code resources are also made publicly available.

Abstract: Advances in large language models have driven strong performance across many tasks, but their memory and compute costs still hinder deployment. SVD-based compression reduces storage and can speed up inference via low-rank factors, yet performance depends on how rank is allocated under a global compression ratio. Prior methods often use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices, despite large differences in loss sensitivity, or rely on expensive iterative pre-truncation optimization to determine per matrix ranks. We propose \textbf{Zero Sum SVD} (\textbf{ZS-SVD}), a post-training method that performs \emph{global} singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. \textbf{ZS-SVD} prunes components across the whole model with a \textbf{zero sum} rule that keeps the cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks without solving a rank allocation optimization. Motivated by evidence that gradients near pretrained solutions exhibit low rank structure, we also introduce an optional lightweight correction that applies a \textbf{single} projected gradient update after truncation, followed by re-truncation. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show consistent gains across diverse benchmarks and compression ratios. Code is available at https://github.com/mint-vu/Zero-Sum-SVD

*Stefanos Pertigkiozoglou,Mircea Petrache,Shubhendu Trivedi,Kostas Daniilidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper introduces RECM, a method to adjust neural network symmetry constraints dynamically to improve generalization and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strict equivariance constraints can hinder learning due to optimization complexity, and current methods to relax these constraints are task-tuned and costly.

Method: Proposes Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM) to adaptively learn symmetry relaxation levels using training signals without task-specific tuning.

Result: RECM provably converges relaxation levels to optimal values and achieves better performance across diverse symmetrical and approximate symmetrical tasks.

Conclusion: RECM balances equivariance and flexibility automatically, leading to superior performance with minimized prior knowledge requirements.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks exploit underlying task symmetries to improve generalization, but strict equivariance constraints can induce more complex optimization dynamics that can hinder learning. Prior work addresses these limitations by relaxing strict equivariance during training, but typically relies on prespecified, explicit, or implicit target levels of relaxation for each network layer, which are task-dependent and costly to tune. We propose Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM), a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from the training signal and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge about the task-dependent target relaxation level. We demonstrate that under the proposed RECM update, the relaxation level of each layer provably converges to a value upper-bounded by its symmetry gap, namely the degree to which its input-target distribution deviates from exact symmetry. Consequently, layers processing symmetric distributions recover full equivariance, while those with approximate symmetries retain sufficient flexibility to learn non-symmetric solutions when warranted by the data. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse exact and approximate equivariant tasks, including the challenging molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset.

*Gibbs Nwemadji,Bruno Loureiro,Jean Barbier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Excessive pre-training can hinder the fine-tuning process, particularly under LoRA settings, by slowing down optimization dynamics despite task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically investigate the relationship between pre-training strength and fine-tuning outcomes, challenging a common assumption that pre-training always helps.

Method: The authors mathematically analyze fine-tuning dynamics using single-index models and one-pass SGD. They use summary statistics to describe the convergence based on pre-training alignment and task non-linearity.

Result: The study finds that overly strong pre-training can slow down optimization during fine-tuning, even on aligned tasks, due to prolonged search phases.

Conclusion: The paper challenges the naive belief that more pre-training always helps in fine-tuning. Excessive pre-training can have adverse effects depending on task difficulty and alignment.

Abstract: Pre-training on a source task is usually expected to facilitate fine-tuning on similar downstream problems. In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.

### [386] [Late-Stage Generalization Collapse in Grokking: Detecting anti-grokking with Weightwatcher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02859)
*Hari K Prakash,Charles H Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new phase, called 'anti-grokking,' where after successful generalization, test accuracy unexpectedly collapses while training accuracy remains perfect in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and understand the phenomena beyond grokking in neural networks, specifically identifying and diagnosing the anti-grokking phase.

Method: They extended the training regime far beyond standard for two setups (MLP on MNIST and transformer on modular addition) and used the WeightWatcher tool to detect signals such as Correlation Traps and HTSR layer metrics.

Result: Correlation Traps and HTSR metrics successfully diagnosed anti-grokking. Other diagnostics failed to track this phase, showing that anti-grokking involves prototype memorization and catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: Anti-grokking represents a distinct late-stage failure in generalization for neural networks and offers insights into memorization and catastrophic forgetting, applying to various architectures including large-scale LLMs.

Abstract: \emph{Memorization} in neural networks lacks a precise operational definition and is often inferred from the grokking regime, where training accuracy saturates while test accuracy remains very low. We identify a previously unreported third phase of grokking in this training regime: \emph{anti-grokking}, a late-stage collapse of generalization.
  We revisit two canonical grokking setups: a 3-layer MLP trained on a subset of MNIST and a transformer trained on modular addition, but extended training far beyond standard. In both cases, after models transition from pre-grokking to successful generalization, test accuracy collapses back to chance while training accuracy remains perfect, indicating a distinct post-generalization failure mode.
  To diagnose anti-grokking, we use the open-source \texttt{WeightWatcher} tool based on HTSR/SETOL theory. The primary signal is the emergence of \emph{Correlation Traps}: anomalously large eigenvalues beyond the Marchenko--Pastur bulk in the empirical spectral density of shuffled weight matrices, which are predicted to impair generalization. As a secondary signal, anti-grokking corresponds to the average HTSR layer quality metric $α$ deviating from $2.0$. Neither metric requires access to the test or training data.
  We compare these signals to alternative grokking diagnostic, including $\ell_2$ norms, Activation Sparsity, Absolute Weight Entropy, and Local Circuit Complexity. These track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to identify anti-grokking. Finally, we show that Correlation Traps can induce catastrophic forgetting and/or prototype memorization, and observe similar pathologies in large-scale LLMs, like OSS GPT 20/120B.

*Xiyuan Wei,Linli Zhou,Bokun Wang,Chih-Jen Lin,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization algorithm, SCENT, for compositional entropic risk minimization problems involving Log-Expectation-Exponential (Log-E-Exp) functions, aiming to resolve numerical and convergence issues in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization algorithms for entropic risk minimization face challenges such as non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence, which hinder their application to large-scale machine learning problems.

Method: The proposed SCENT algorithm uses geometry-aware stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD) updates in the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization, leveraging a Bregman divergence tailored to the negative exponential function.

Result: SCENT achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for convex problems, theoretically outperforms standard SGD on the dual variable, and empirically excels in tasks like extreme classification and distributionally robust optimization.

Conclusion: SCENT is a robust and effective optimization algorithm addressing key limitations in entropic risk minimization, demonstrating both theoretical and practical advantages in machine learning contexts.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization for a family of problems termed $\textbf{compositional entropic risk minimization}$, in which each data's loss is formulated as a Log-Expectation-Exponential (Log-E-Exp) function. The Log-E-Exp formulation serves as an abstraction of the Log-Sum-Exponential (LogSumExp) function when the explicit summation inside the logarithm is taken over a gigantic number of items and is therefore expensive to evaluate. While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem. The key to our design is a $\textbf{stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD)}$ update for the dual variable, equipped with a Bregman divergence induced by a negative exponential function that faithfully captures the geometry of the objective. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the proposed SCENT algorithm for convex problems; (ii) we theoretically characterize the advantages of SPMD over standard SGD update for optimizing the dual variable; and (iii) we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SCENT on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning and distributionally robust optimization, where it consistently outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs), expanding Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for improved accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs are limited by fixed expressions restricting predictive accuracy and adaptability to user needs.

Method: The framework extends CBMs by introducing multiple experts with varied functional forms in Linear and Symbolic models.

Result: Models show enhanced adaptability and achieve a better balance between accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: M-CBEs offer a more versatile solution, enabling tailored accuracy-interpretability trade-offs for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) promote interpretability by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs typically fix their task predictor to a single linear or Boolean expression, limiting both predictive accuracy and adaptability to diverse user needs. We propose Mixture of Concept Bottleneck Experts (M-CBEs), a framework that generalizes existing CBMs along two dimensions: the number of experts and the functional form of each expert, exposing an underexplored region of the design space. We investigate this region by instantiating two novel models: Linear M-CBE, which learns a finite set of linear expressions, and Symbolic M-CBE, which leverages symbolic regression to discover expert functions from data under user-specified operator vocabularies. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that varying the mixture size and functional form provides a robust framework for navigating the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, adapting to different user and task needs.

*Anthony Fuller,James R. Green,Evan Shelhamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Souping, a method to generalize model soups to self-supervised learning (SSL), enhancing robustness and transferability using diverse ingredients from SSL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model soups require supervised learning and labeled data; this paper aims to expand the approach to self-supervised learning, which utilizes unlabeled data, for better adaptability to shifts and improved predictions.

Method: The authors propose Self-Souping, which involves mixing parameters of models fine-tuned using different SSL algorithms or hyperparameters on data shifts or tasks, followed by re-finetuning on the train data.

Result: Self-Souping improves prediction robustness on corrupted datasets, achieving gains of +3.5% on ImageNet-C and +7% on LAION-C. Combining diverse SSL ingredients surpasses the accuracy of any single method.

Conclusion: Self-Souping enables improved flexibility and robustness in self-supervised learning, leveraging varied SSL algorithms and hyperparameters to create superior model soups.

Abstract: Model soups are strange and strangely effective combinations of parameters. They take a model (the stock), fine-tune it into multiple models (the ingredients), and then mix their parameters back into one model (the soup) to improve predictions. While all known soups require supervised learning, and optimize the same loss on labeled data, our recipes for Self-\emph{Soup}ervision generalize soups to self-supervised learning (SSL). Our Self-Souping lets us flavor ingredients on new data sources, e.g. from unlabeled data from a task for transfer or from a shift for robustness. We show that Self-Souping on corrupted test data, then fine-tuning back on uncorrupted train data, boosts robustness by +3.5\% (ImageNet-C) and +7\% (LAION-C). Self-\emph{Soup}ervision also unlocks countless SSL algorithms to cook the diverse ingredients needed for more robust soups. We show for the first time that ingredients can differ in their SSL hyperparameters -- and more surprisingly, in their SSL algorithms. We cook soups of MAE, MoCoV3, and MMCR ingredients that are more accurate than any one single SSL ingredient.

*Zeyu Fang,Zuyuan Zhang,Mahdi Imani,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MC-ETM, a model to address distribution shift issues in offline RL, by using energy-based transition models to improve robustness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based offline RL faces challenges due to distribution shift, where policy rollouts explore states with weak dataset support, causing severe value estimation errors.

Method: The proposed MC-ETM approach trains energy-based transition models with a manifold projection and diffusion negative sampler, which enhances sensitivity to out-of-distribution data. Policy optimization includes reliability signals based on energy thresholds and stability is achieved through pessimistic penalties.

Result: MC-ETM achieves better multi-step dynamics modeling and higher normalized returns on offline RL benchmarks, especially under challenging dynamics and sparse data.

Conclusion: MC-ETM enhances robustness and performance in offline RL by addressing distribution shift issues with energy-based modeling and conservative policy strategies.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning is brittle under distribution shift: policy improvement drives rollouts into state--action regions weakly supported by the dataset, where compounding model error yields severe value overestimation. We propose Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM), which train conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection--diffusion negative sampler. MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk.

### [391] [DynSplit-KV: Dynamic Semantic Splitting for KVCache Compression in Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03184)
*Jiancai Ye,Jun Liu,Qingchen Li,Tianlang Zhao,Hanbin Zhang,Jiayi Pan,Ningyi Xu,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DynSplit-KV, a method for compressing Key-Value (KV) Cache dynamically to improve efficiency and accuracy in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing rigid splitting strategies for KVCache compression suffer from significant accuracy loss due to mismatched semantic boundaries, and they introduce high inference overhead in long-context scenarios.

Method: DynSplit-KV employs a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy to align semantics with the KVCache, and a uniform mapping strategy to transform variable-length blocks into fixed-length formats.

Result: DynSplit-KV achieves a 49.9% accuracy improvement, 2.2x speedup over FlashAttention, and 2.6x memory reduction in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed DynSplit-KV method effectively addresses the challenges of memory footprint and inference efficiency in long-context LLMs, achieving both reduced overhead and improved accuracy.

Abstract: Although Key-Value (KV) Cache is essential for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference, its growing memory footprint in long-context scenarios poses a significant bottleneck, making KVCache compression crucial. Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x. Experiments show that DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy, 2.2x speedup compared with FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), an innovative framework for multi-agent traffic signal control, achieving significant improvements in network-wide traffic flow and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in multi-agent coordination and sample usage within reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control systems.

Method: MADT reformulates traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging techniques such as graph attention mechanisms, temporal transformers, and return-to-go conditioning.

Result: MADT outperforms existing methods by reducing average travel time by 5-6%, excelling in experimental settings involving both synthetic and real-world traffic simulations.

Conclusion: MADT demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging historical data with offline learning, showcasing its potential for high-performing traffic signal optimization and future online tuning applications.

Abstract: Traffic signal control is a critical challenge in urban transportation, requiring coordination among multiple intersections to optimize network-wide traffic flow. While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.

### [393] [Prompt Augmentation Scales up GRPO Training on Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190)
*Wenquan Lu,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of entropy collapse in reinforcement learning for mathematical reasoning in large language models, introducing 'prompt augmentation' to stabilize training and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in reinforcement learning for mathematical reasoning, specifically the entropy collapse issue that restricts longer training horizons and sustained policy improvement.

Method: The paper introduces 'prompt augmentation,' which uses diverse prompts and formats during training to enhance rollout diversity, enabling stable and effective scaling of training without relying on KL regularization.

Result: The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance with a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model, reaching 44.5% per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3% per-question accuracy on standard datasets like AIME24 and MATH500.

Conclusion: Prompt augmentation offers a robust training strategy that addresses entropy collapse, allows longer, more stable training periods, and leads to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for adapting large language models called Streaming Merging, with a specific focus on ARM (Activation-guided Rotation-aware Merging) to optimize model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the increasing need for efficient and effective model adaptation as large language models (LLMs) grow in scale, with current methods being inadequate in maintaining fine-tuning dynamics.

Method: The paper proposes Streaming Merging, where ARM plays a core role. ARM uses rotation vectors derived from activation subspaces and treats merging coefficients as learning rates to approximate gradient descent processes. This preserves the geometric structure of parameter updates.

Result: ARM surpasses traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) convergence. Experimental results showed ARM works effectively across various model sizes (1.7B to 14B parameters) and domains like math and coding tasks.

Conclusion: ARM provides a scalable, lightweight, and innovative approach for model adaptation, outperforming conventional fine-tuning techniques and delivering superior efficiency.

Abstract: The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \textbf{ARM} (\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \textbf{R}otation-aware \textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a training strategy using wearable devices and AI to improve biosignal health monitoring accuracy by addressing clinical label sparsity and includes learnable decay rates for temporal sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance health monitoring algorithms using PPG biosignals, tackling the challenge of sparse clinical labels which diminish the reliability of distant supervision.

Method: A novel training strategy is developed to learn biomarker-specific decay rates that assign weights based on temporal gaps between samples and labels, incorporating a regularizer to avoid trivial solutions.

Result: The proposed method improves health monitoring accuracy (AUPRC of 0.715) on smartwatch PPG data across 450 participants, outperforming baseline models and validating robust decay functions.

Conclusion: The method offers improved accuracy and interpretable decay rates, demonstrating its ability to capture temporal sensitivity in health monitoring based on biosignals.

Abstract: Advances in wearable computing and AI have increased interest in leveraging PPG for health monitoring over the past decade. One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.

Result: Using CADS, the authors create MMSynthetic-20K dataset and develop R1-SyntheticVL, which achieves strong performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: CADS effectively synthesizes challenging and diverse multimodal data, leading to improved performance of MLLMs and demonstrating its value in real-world applications.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop effective data synthesis techniques that autonomously synthesize multimodal training data for enhancing MLLMs in solving complex real-world tasks. To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks.

*Shir Ashury-Tahan,Ariel Gera,Elron Bandel,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer,Leshem Choshen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper argues that robustness in models emerges naturally with task-specific competence and does not need to be treated as an independent capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between model robustness and task-specific competence, as robustness is seen as a critical challenge for real-world applications.

Method: Empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, varying temperatures).

Result: Found a strong positive correlation between high task performance and robustness, showing robustness mainly depends on task-specific competence.

Conclusion: Improving robustness may not require explicit effort since it emerges with performance gains. Easier tasks are suitable for reliable real-world deployment despite issues with new tasks.

Abstract: Robustness is often regarded as a critical future challenge for real-world applications, where stability is essential. However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment.

*Xiaoyuan Cheng,Wenxuan Yuan,Boyang Li,Yuanchao Xu,Yiming Yang,Hao Liang,Bei Peng,Robert Loftin,Zhuo Sun,Yukun Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALGD, a method improving the stability and safety of reinforcement learning (RL) using diffusion policies in off-policy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability and safety issues in online reinforcement learning settings, particularly when using diffusion-based methods for policy generation.

Method: The proposed method, ALGD, leverages an augmented Lagrangian approach to stabilize policy generation and training by locally convexifying the Lagrangian landscape in diffusion-based RL.

Result: ALGD stabilizes policy generation and training, maintaining strong and consistent performance across various environments in both theoretical and empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: ALGD enhances safe RL by resolving instability issues in diffusion-based settings without compromising the optimal policy distribution, proving its theoretical and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion policy sampling enables reinforcement learning (RL) to represent multimodal action distributions beyond suboptimal unimodal Gaussian policies. However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MeKi, a system for scaling LLMs on edge devices without increasing computational costs, by leveraging storage (ROM) to inject expert knowledge into the model during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deploy high-performance LLMs on edge devices like smartphones, addressing constraints in RAM and computational power is crucial for improved user experience and smooth operation.

Method: MeKi employs token-level memory experts to store semantic knowledge, and uses a re-parameterization strategy to compress training parameter matrices into compact static lookup tables stored in ROM, adding no latency overhead during inference.

Result: Experiments show that MeKi achieves significantly better performance compared to dense LLM baselines, with no additional inference delays, showcasing its ability to scale effectively through memory-based methods.

Conclusion: Memory-based scaling, as demonstrated by MeKi, is a promising paradigm for deploying efficient and high-capacity LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices such as smartphones.

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) typically relies on increasing the number of parameters or test-time computations to boost performance. However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi.

*Zimo Wang,Ishit Mehta,Haolin Lu,Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Tsui-Wei Weng,Tzu-Mao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distance Marching, a time-unconditional generative modeling technique that improves denoising directions and achieves better generative performance across datasets and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue in time-unconditional models where noisy inputs map to multiple noise levels, causing interference in supervision signals, and to develop a principled approach for improved denoising and generative modeling.

Method: Distance Marching is introduced as a new approach based on distance field modeling, alongside novel losses targeting closer denoising aims and two inference methods.

Result: Distance Marching improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to baselines, surpasses flow matching on ImageNet with fewer sampling steps, and aids in early stopping and OOD detection.

Conclusion: Distance Marching establishes a more precise and effective generative modeling approach, showing significant performance improvements and potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Time-unconditional generative models learn time-independent denoising vector fields. But without time conditioning, the same noisy input may correspond to multiple noise levels and different denoising directions, which interferes with the supervision signal. Inspired by distance field modeling, we propose Distance Marching, a new time-unconditional approach with two principled inference methods. Crucially, we design losses that focus on closer targets. This yields denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold. Across architectures, Distance Marching consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over recent time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet generation, despite removing time input, Distance Marching surpasses flow matching using our losses and inference methods. It achieves lower FID than flow matching's final performance using 60% of the sampling steps and 13.6% lower FID on average across backbone sizes. Moreover, our distance prediction is also helpful for early stopping during sampling and for OOD detection. We hope distance field modeling can serve as a principled lens for generative modeling.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a publicly available dataset for targeted identification of post-trauma sepsis, addressing a significant gap in sepsis research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis has high morbidity, mortality, and costs, and early detection can improve clinical outcomes, but current datasets overlook the complexities of critically ill trauma patients.

Method: The authors extracted and labeled a post-trauma sepsis dataset from MIMIC-III, aligning it with standardized clinical facts, and framed detection in ICU settings as a rare event detection problem.

Result: They validated the new dataset and conducted experiments to benchmark early detection methods, demonstrating the need for further advancements using their dataset.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings highlight the relevance of focused research on post-trauma sepsis, facilitating improved early detection strategies in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Sepsis is a major public health concern due to its high morbidity, mortality, and cost. Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called 3D-Learning to improve machine learning under worst-case distribution by leveraging diffusion models for better decision-making in out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine Learning models in PTO pipelines often fail under out-of-distribution conditions, leading to poor decision-making performance in applications like cloud LLM serving, and workload scheduling.

Method: Proposes 3D-Learning, which incorporates diffusion models to identify worst-case distributions for improving decisions, instead of relying on classical DRO approaches.

Result: 3D-Learning achieves better generalization and outperforms classical DRO and data augmentation methods in a resource provisioning task for language models.

Conclusion: By using diffusion models, the approach effectively balances average and worst-case decision-making performance under OOD situations.

Abstract: Predict-then-Optimize (PTO) pipelines are widely employed in computing and networked systems, where Machine Learning (ML) models are used to predict critical contextual information for downstream decision-making tasks such as cloud LLM serving, data center demand response, and edge workload scheduling. However, these ML predictors are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples at test time, leading to significant decision performance degradation due to large prediction errors. To address the generalization challenges under OOD conditions, we present the framework of Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (DR-DFL), which trains ML models to optimize decision performance under the worst-case distribution. Instead of relying on classical Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) techniques, we propose Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (3D-Learning), which searches for the worst-case distribution within the parameterized space of a diffusion model. By leveraging the powerful distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models, 3D-Learning identifies worst-case distributions that remain consistent with real data, achieving a favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios. Empirical results on an LLM resource provisioning task demonstrate that 3D-Learning outperforms existing DRO and Data Augmentation methods in OOD generalization performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR), combining sparse and standard VAEs to solve inverse problems with uncertainty estimation and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems require reconstructing hidden quantities from noisy measurements, often necessitating uncertainty estimation for interpretable and reliable solutions.

Method: The proposed vsPAIR architecture connects a standard VAE (observations) with a sparse VAE (quantities of interest) using a learned latent mapping and implements innovative sparse encoding techniques for structured inference.

Result: Experiments in blind inpainting and computed tomography demonstrate that vsPAIR effectively solves inverse problems, providing structured and interpretable uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: vsPAIR is a novel approach capable of addressing inverse problems with enhanced interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and structured representation.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to many scientific and engineering disciplines; they arise when one seeks to reconstruct hidden, underlying quantities from noisy measurements. Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.
  We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing retrosynthesis evaluation methods that rely on exact matches, which fail to capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis.

Method: Introduced ChemCensor, a metric emphasizing chemical plausibility, and a new dataset called CREED with millions of validated reactions for training and benchmarking LLMs.

Result: Demonstrated that the framework and the model trained on CREED improve performance over existing LLMs in retrosynthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and dataset better align retrosynthesis evaluations with human practices and enhance performance in this field.

Abstract: Recent progress has expanded the use of large language models (LLMs) in drug discovery, including synthesis planning. However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices. We also introduce CREED, a novel dataset comprising millions of ChemCensor-validated reaction records for LLM training, and use it to train a model that improves over the LLM baselines under this benchmark.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quant VideoGen (QVG), a framework designed to address KV cache memory bottlenecks in autoregressive video generation by optimizing memory efficiency and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle GPU memory constraints caused by KV cache growth in autoregressive video diffusion models, which limits hardware deployability and degrades long-horizon consistency in video generation.

Method: Quant VideoGen (QVG) employs Semantic Aware Smoothing to leverage video redundancy and Progressive Residual Quantization to manage memory efficiently while maintaining high generation quality.

Result: QVG reduces KV cache memory by up to 7 times with less than 4% end-to-end latency overhead, outperforming existing methods in video generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed QVG framework effectively enhances memory efficiency and video generation quality, paving the way for broader deployment and improved long-horizon video consistency.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

*Xiaocai Zhang,Neema Nassir,Lok Sang Chan,Milad Haghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MA2B-DDQN, a framework for optimizing traveler equity in traffic signal coordination via a unique action-branching control approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent DRL methods for multimodal traffic coordination are largely vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional, discrete action spaces.

Method: The authors developed an action-branching framework, decomposing control into intersection-level actions and a global action for phase durations. A human-centric reward was also designed to optimize for traveler-level equity, considering pedestrians, vehicles, and transit.

Result: The proposed MA2B-DDQN model demonstrated significant reduction in delayed travelers across realistic traffic scenarios and outperformed existing methods in Melbourne, Australia.

Conclusion: This scalable, human-centric DRL framework balances equity in multimodal traffic corridors and is adaptable to various urban settings, advocating for fairer traffic signal systems.

Abstract: Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.

*Hoang M. Ngo,Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Quan Nguyen,Nguyen Do,Incheol Shin,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-ShiftDP, a privacy mechanism specifically for Quantum Machine Learning (QML), leveraging quantum gradient properties to enhance data privacy while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving training data privacy in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as classical methods like DP-SGD do not exploit quantum-specific features.

Method: The paper combines the parameter-shift rule in QML with calibrated Gaussian and quantum noise, allowing a tighter sensitivity analysis, reduced noise requirements, and formal guarantees on privacy and utility.

Result: Experiments show that Q-ShiftDP outperforms classical differential privacy methods, achieving a better privacy-utility trade-off on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Q-ShiftDP enhances both data privacy and model performance in QML by utilizing the unique properties of quantum gradients and noise, offering a promising direction for private quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) promises significant computational advantages, but preserving training data privacy remains challenging. Classical approaches like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) add noise to gradients but fail to exploit the unique properties of quantum gradient estimation. In this work, we introduce the Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP), the first privacy mechanism tailored to QML. By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML.

### [408] [Co2PO: Coordinated Constrained Policy Optimization for Multi-Agent RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02970)
*Shrenik Patel,Christine Truong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Co2PO, an improved framework for constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using risk-aware communication and proactive safety measures, achieving better performance and compliance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in MARL of balancing exploration and safety constraints, as current methods often over-emphasize safety at the cost of exploration, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposed Co2PO architecture employs a shared blackboard for positional intent signals, a hazard predictor to forecast potential safety violations, and integrates forecasts into a constrained optimization process, enabling proactive risk management.

Result: Co2PO demonstrates superior returns and safety compliance compared to existing methods, validated through multi-agent safety benchmarks and ablation studies highlighting the importance of its components.

Conclusion: Co2PO balances exploration and safety constraints more effectively by integrating risk-aware communication and proactive optimization, proving its efficacy in complex MARL scenarios.

Abstract: Constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces a fundamental tension between exploration and safety-constrained optimization. Existing leading approaches, such as Lagrangian methods, typically rely on global penalties or centralized critics that react to violations after they occur, often suppressing exploration and leading to over-conservatism. We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components.

*Duy Nguyen,Hanqi Xiao,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Hyunji Lee,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoRSA, a framework for editing knowledge in large language models while addressing challenges such as generalization, stability, and knowledge conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keeping large language models up to date is crucial, but full retraining is costly. Existing methods like model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often face issues such as limited generalization and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The proposed CoRSA framework optimizes knowledge editing by improving input generalization, minimizing loss curvature for stability, and resolving conflicts between new and prior knowledge.

Result: CoRSA demonstrated significant improvement in generalization across fact editing benchmarks, reduced catastrophic forgetting by 27.82%, and achieved higher performance in the code domain compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CoRSA is a robust and efficient solution for updating knowledge in LLMs, maintaining high efficacy while addressing limitations of existing methods like knowledge conflicts and instability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on internal knowledge to solve many downstream tasks, making it crucial to keep them up to date. Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.

### [410] [Efficient Estimation of Kernel Surrogate Models for Task Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03783)
*Zhenshuo Zhang,Minxuan Duan,Hongyang R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses task attribution in AI models through kernel surrogate models, improving performance prediction and task selection efficiency compared to linear approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the task attribution challenge and quantify the influence of individual training tasks on target task performance in AI models efficiently, surpassing computationally infeasible methods.

Method: Proposed kernel surrogate models that capture second-order interactions among tasks and utilized a gradient-based estimation procedure to efficiently learn these kernels without retraining.

Result: Experimental results show kernel models are 25% more accurate in correlating with leave-one-out ground truth and provide a 40% improvement in downstream task selection compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Kernel surrogate models effectively improve task attribution transparency and downstream task selection, making them pivotal for optimizing multi-task training in AI systems.

Abstract: Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.

*Jiangyong Yu,Xiaomeng Han,Xing Hu,Chen Xu,Zhe Jiang,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI) framework to approximate nonlinear functions in LLMs and neural networks efficiently, significantly boosting computational efficiency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the substantial memory and computation costs in deploying LLMs, particularly focusing on the inefficiency of nonlinear layers.

Method: The NLI framework uses a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal approach to approximate nonlinear functions, employing Bellman's optimality principle for minimal interpolation error.

Result: The NLI framework enables seamless integration into LLMs with negligible accuracy loss. Hardware implementation (NLI Engine) achieves over 4x computational efficiency improvement compared to current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: NLI provides an efficient, hardware-friendly solution for nonlinear function approximation, making LLMs and other neural networks more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their deployment is often constrained by substantial memory footprints and computational costs. While prior work has achieved significant progress in compressing and accelerating linear layers, nonlinear layers-such as SiLU, RMSNorm, and Softmax-still heavily depend on high-precision floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs.

*Evan Wang,Simon Chess,Daniel Lee,Siyuan Ge,Ajit Mallavarapu,Vasily Ilin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces APRIL, a dataset for training models to repair erroneous Lean proofs and provide natural-language diagnoses using compiler feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Lean datasets lack supervision for understanding and repairing failures in proofs, making it difficult to train neural theorem provers to handle errors effectively.

Method: The authors created APRIL, a dataset with 260,000 pairs of erroneous proofs, compiler diagnostics, corrected proofs, and natural-language explanations.

Result: Training language models on APRIL significantly improves accuracy in repairing erroneous proofs and reasoning based on compiler feedback; a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms other open-source baselines.

Conclusion: Diagnostic-conditioned supervision, as demonstrated through APRIL, enhances the capability of feedback-using provers and offers a complementary training signal for improving theorem-proving systems.

Abstract: As neural theorem provers become increasingly agentic, the ability to interpret and act on compiler feedback is critical. However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers. Our dataset is available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/uw-math-ai/APRIL}{this link}.

### [413] [Adaptive Batch Sizes Using Non-Euclidean Gradient Noise Scales for Stochastic Sign and Spectral Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03001)
*Hiroki Naganuma,Shagun Gupta,Youssef Briki,Ioannis Mitliagkas,Irina Rish,Parameswaran Raman,Hao-Jun Michael Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive batch size method using non-Euclidean gradient noise scales tailored to modern machine learning optimizers like signSGD and specSGD. This approach significantly reduces training steps while matching validation loss on large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning systems rely on fixed or manually tuned batch sizes, which can be inflexible, brittle, and resource-intensive to optimize. Adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale (GNS) have potential, but existing approaches fail to account for the geometry of widely used optimizers beyond Euclidean methods.

Method: It derives and defines gradient noise scales based on the dual norms for optimizers like signSGD ($ll_∞$) and specSGD ($S_∞$). The authors also propose a practical variance estimation method that uses batch gradient data in distributed systems.

Result: Experiments show that the adaptive non-Euclidean GNS-based batch size strategies reduce training steps by up to 66% while maintaining comparable validation loss performance on a large-scale 160M parameter Llama model.

Conclusion: Adaptive batch size strategies incorporating non-Euclidean GNS are effective for modern optimizers, offering faster training while retaining model performance.

Abstract: To maximize hardware utilization, modern machine learning systems typically employ large constant or manually tuned batch size schedules, relying on heuristics that are brittle and costly to tune. Existing adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale (GNS) offer a principled alternative. However, their assumption of SGD's Euclidean geometry creates a fundamental mismatch with popular optimizers based on generalized norms, such as signSGD / Signum ($\ell_\infty$) and stochastic spectral descent (specSGD) / Muon ($\mathcal{S}_\infty$). In this work, we derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD that naturally emerge from the geometry of their respective dual norms. To practically estimate these non-Euclidean metrics, we propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages the local mini-batch gradients on different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS enable us to match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160 million parameter Llama model.

*Xiangrui Zhang,Chunyue Song,Wei Dai,Zheng Zhang,Kaihua Gao,Furong Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents CGSTAE, a model combining a correlation graph learning method and spatial-temporal encoder-decoder to enhance fault detection and monitoring in industrial processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability and interpretability in industrial process monitoring by addressing the dynamic relationships between variables and uncovering causality.

Method: The CGSTAE combines a correlation graph structure learning module (SSAM) with a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder utilizing GCLSTM. A novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is used to derive causal graphs.

Result: CGSTAE successfully reconstructs process data and enhances process monitoring and fault detection, validated through experiments on the Tennessee Eastman process and air separation process.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in improving interpretability and reliability for industrial process monitoring and fault detection by utilizing causal and spatial-temporal modeling.

Abstract: To improve the reliability and interpretability of industrial process monitoring, this article proposes a Causal Graph Spatial-Temporal Autoencoder (CGSTAE). The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process.

*Xueying Ding,Haomin Wen,Simon Klütterman,Leman Akoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OUTFORMER is a new model for outlier detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring labeled outlier data. It offers zero-shot, plug-and-play deployment with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying outlier detection without labeled outliers and simplify algorithm and hyperparameter selection in real-world tasks.

Method: OUTFORMER advances outlier detection through a mixture of synthetic priors, self-evolving curriculum training, and in-context learning. It is pretrained on synthetic datasets and operates in a zero-shot manner without requiring bespoke model training or selection.

Result: OUTFORMER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, including AdBench and two additional large-scale OD benchmarks with over 1,500 datasets, while maintaining efficient inference time.

Conclusion: OUTFORMER represents a significant step forward in the field of outlier detection, providing an effective, fast, and user-friendly solution for real-world deployment of OD tasks.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) is widely used in practice; but its effective deployment on new tasks is hindered by lack of labeled outliers, which makes algorithm and hyperparameter selection notoriously hard. Foundation models (FMs) have transformed ML, and OD is no exception: Shen et. al. (2025) introduced FoMo-0D, the first FM for OD, achieving remarkable performance against numerous baselines. This work introduces OUTFORMER, which advances FoMo-0D with (1) a mixture of synthetic priors and (2) self-evolving curriculum training. OUTFORMER is pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets and infers test labels of a new task by using its training data as in-context input. Inference is fast and zero-shot, requiring merely forward pass and no labeled outliers. Thanks to in-context learning, it requires zero additional work-no OD model training or bespoke model selection-enabling truly plug-and-play deployment. OUTFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the prominent AdBench, as well as two new large-scale OD benchmarks that we introduce, comprising over 1,500 datasets, while maintaining speedy inference.

*Yixuan Even Xu,John Kirchenbauer,Yash Savani,Asher Trockman,Alexander Robey,Tom Goldstein,Fei Fang,J. Zico Kolter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Antidistillation Fingerprinting (ADFP), a new method for robustly detecting when third-party models are trained using outputs from frontier large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current fingerprinting techniques that trade generation quality for fingerprint detectability, creating a need for improved distillation detection methods.

Method: ADFP identifies and samples tokens that maximize the detectability of fingerprints in student models by using a proxy model and aligning with the learning dynamics of students, rather than relying on heuristic or incidental biases.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like GSM8K and OASST1 show that ADFP significantly outperforms existing methods by improving detection confidence while maintaining high utility.

Conclusion: ADFP offers a principled and effective method to detect model distillation with minimal trade-offs, advancing fingerprinting techniques in LLMs.

Abstract: Model distillation enables efficient emulation of frontier large language models (LLMs), creating a need for robust mechanisms to detect when a third-party student model has trained on a teacher model's outputs. However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown.

*Guohao Yang,Tongle Wu,Yuanxiong Guo,Ying Sun,Yanmin Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedKRSO, a method to efficiently fine-tune large language models in federated learning settings, reducing communication and memory constraints while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high communication and memory costs during fine-tuning large language models in federated learning without sacrificing performance.

Method: The proposed method, FedKRSO, uses random low-dimensional subspaces for updates and accumulators for transmitting changes instead of full model parameters, significantly reducing resource requirements while enabling efficient fine-tuning.

Result: FedKRSO demonstrated superior performance with lower communication and memory overhead compared to existing approaches in various federated learning scenarios, tested on the GLUE benchmark.

Conclusion: FedKRSO bridges the gap between efficiency and performance in federated learning, making it viable for fine-tuning large language models even under resource constraints.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is essential to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks. As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Consistency Deep Equilibrium Models (C-DEQs) to accelerate inference in Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) through consistency distillation, achieving faster and more efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEQs, while powerful for infinite-depth modeling with constant memory usage, suffer from high inference latency due to iterative fixed-point solvers. There is a need to reduce this latency without compromising performance.

Method: The authors reframe DEQ inference as evolution along an ODE trajectory towards equilibrium. Their approach trains C-DEQs to map intermediate states directly to the fixed-point, allowing for faster inference with fewer steps.

Result: C-DEQs achieve consistent 2-20× accuracy improvements over conventional DEQs under the same inference budget across various domain tasks.

Conclusion: C-DEQs successfully accelerate DEQ inference while preserving performance, providing flexibility in computation-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in deep learning, offering the ability to model infinite-depth networks with constant memory usage. However, DEQs incur significant inference latency due to the iterative nature of fixed-point solvers. In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAFE-KD, a method for reducing inference costs by enabling early exit in deep networks, while guaranteeing selective misclassification risk through conformal risk control calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deciding when early exit is safe in multi-exit neural networks for reduced inference costs, while ensuring robustness and accuracy.

Method: The method involves attaching lightweight exit heads to vision backbones, employing Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD) to distill knowledge into each exit, enforcing consistency across exits, and calibrating inference using conformal risk control.

Result: SAFE-KD improves accuracy and compute trade-offs, ensures better calibration, maintains robustness to data corruption, and provides provable finite-sample risk guarantees across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: SAFE-KD demonstrates the feasibility of safe and efficient early-exit networks with reliable risk control, presenting a robust solution for practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Early-exit networks reduce inference cost by allowing ``easy'' inputs to stop early, but practical deployment hinges on knowing \emph{when} early exit is safe. We introduce SAFE-KD, a universal multi-exit wrapper for modern vision backbones that couples hierarchical distillation with \emph{conformal risk control}. SAFE-KD attaches lightweight exit heads at intermediate depths, distills a strong teacher into all exits via Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), and enforces deep-to-shallow consistency between exits. At inference, we calibrate per-exit stopping thresholds on a held-out set using conformal risk control (CRC) to guarantee a user-specified \emph{selective} misclassification risk (among the samples that exit early) under exchangeability. Across multiple datasets and architectures, SAFE-KD yields improved accuracy compute trade-offs, stronger calibration, and robust performance under corruption while providing finite-sample risk guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), a unified neural solver for homotopy problems, replacing hand-crafted heuristics with learned reinforcement learning policies, and achieving better performance in generalization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers for homotopy problems rely on suboptimal and task-specific heuristics, necessitating a unified and efficient approach.

Method: NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem, employs reinforcement learning, and incorporates amortized training for efficient inference across problem instances.

Result: NPC demonstrates superior efficiency, generalizes effectively to new instances, and outperforms traditional methods and baselines across homotopy tasks.

Conclusion: Unifying homotopy problems into a neural framework (NPC) improves solver design, offering efficient, robust solutions across domains while eliminating reliance on hand-crafted heuristics.

Abstract: The Homotopy paradigm, a general principle for solving challenging problems, appears across diverse domains such as robust optimization, global optimization, polynomial root-finding, and sampling. Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework.

Method: ProCAD includes a clarifying agent to ask clarifying questions for ambiguous or incomplete prompts, and a coding agent that translates the refined input into a CAD program. It uses fine-tuning on a specialized dataset and agentic supervised fine-tuning.

Result: ProCAD achieves significant improvements in robustness and accuracy. It reduces mean Chamfer distance by 79.9% and invalidity ratio from 4.8% to 0.9% compared to top models like Claude Sonnet 4.5.

Conclusion: ProCAD demonstrates effectiveness in handling ambiguous text prompts for CAD program generation, outperforming existing models and ensuring reduced errors and higher precision.

Abstract: Large language models have recently enabled text-to-CAD systems that synthesize parametric CAD programs (e.g., CadQuery) from natural language prompts. In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.

*Zhiyuan Yao,Yi-Kai Zhang,Yuxin Chen,Yueqing Sun,Zishan Xu,Yu Yang,Tianhao Hu,Qi Gu,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoBA-RL is proposed to optimize rollout budget allocation in reinforcement learning, overcoming inefficiencies in standard methods and improving LLM training outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in standard rollout budget allocation methods and improve the capability of LLM reasoning through optimized adaptive allocation.

Method: Developed CoBA-RL, using a Capability-Oriented Value function to evaluate sample training value and a heap-based greedy strategy to allocate resources effectively.

Result: Experimentation demonstrated improved trade-offs between exploration and exploitation, with enhanced generalization performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Optimizing training resource allocation via CoBA-RL enhances efficiency in LLM post-training, proposing significant advancements in reinforcement learning techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning.However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.

*Jinyan Ye,Zhongjie Duan,Zhiwen Li,Cen Chen,Daoyuan Chen,Yaliang Li,Yingda Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a method to optimize initial noise in generative models efficiently by focusing on low-frequency subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time scaling methods are inefficient due to generative models' spectral bias, where high-frequency perturbations have limited impact on outputs.

Method: The proposed SES framework uses evolutionary search to optimize initial noise within low-frequency subspaces, addressing inefficiencies caused by spectral bias.

Result: Experiments reveal SES improves generation quality while reducing computational cost, surpassing existing methods under the same budget.

Conclusion: SES offers a more efficient approach for aligning generative models with downstream tasks, leveraging spectral properties of the generative process.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling offers a versatile paradigm for aligning visual generative models with downstream objectives without parameter updates. However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation. We show that this inefficiency is closely related to a spectral bias in generative dynamics: model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly as frequency increases. Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance hybrid classical-quantum federated learning performance addressing the degradation caused by non-IID data distributions.

Method: Introduces FEDCOMPASS, a layered aggregation framework using spectral clustering for grouping clients and circular mean aggregation with adaptive optimization for stable quantum parameter updates.

Result: Experiments show FEDCOMPASS achieves up to 10.22% higher accuracy and better stability compared to other methods.

Conclusion: FEDCOMPASS effectively addresses the challenges in hybrid classical-quantum federated learning under non-IID data, offering significant performance gains and improved model convergence.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients under privacy constraints. Quantum computing offers potential for alleviating computational and communication burdens in federated learning, yet hybrid classical-quantum federated learning remains susceptible to performance degradation under non-IID data. To address this,we propose FEDCOMPASS, a layered aggregation framework for hybrid classical-quantum federated learning. FEDCOMPASS employs spectral clustering to group clients by class distribution similarity and performs cluster-wise aggregation for classical feature extractors. For quantum parameters, it uses circular mean aggregation combined with adaptive optimization to ensure stable global updates. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that FEDCOMPASS improves test accuracy by up to 10.22% and enhances convergence stability under non-IID settings, outperforming six strong federated learning baselines.

*Jinwoo Lim,Suhyun Kim,Soo-Mook Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes shortcut learning in deep-learning models using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework, focusing on linear and complex neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of shortcut learning, where models overly rely on dominant but non-generalizable features from training data.

Method: Leveraging the NTK framework, analysis is conducted on linear neural networks, defining features as eigenfunctions of NTK to study shortcut learning properties. Empirical extension to more complex architectures (e.g., ResNet-18).

Result: Shortcut features are linked to larger eigenvalues when influenced by imbalanced cluster distributions; features with larger eigenvalues dominate network outputs post-training. Max-margin bias is shown to be insufficient to explain shortcut learning.

Conclusion: Linear neural network findings provide insights into shortcut learning characteristics, extended to complex models.

Abstract: One of the chronic problems of deep-learning models is shortcut learning. In a case where the majority of training data are dominated by a certain feature, neural networks prefer to learn such a feature even if the feature is not generalizable outside the training set. Based on the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we analyzed the case of linear neural networks to derive some important properties of shortcut learning. We defined a feature of a neural network as an eigenfunction of NTK. Then, we found that shortcut features correspond to features with larger eigenvalues when the shortcuts stem from the imbalanced number of samples in the clustered distribution. We also showed that the features with larger eigenvalues still have a large influence on the neural network output even after training, due to data variances in the clusters. Such a preference for certain features remains even when a margin of a neural network output is controlled, which shows that the max-margin bias is not the only major reason for shortcut learning. These properties of linear neural networks are empirically extended for more complex neural networks as a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network and a ResNet-18.

*Felix X. -F. Ye,Xingjie Li,An Yu,Ming-Ching Chang,Linsong Chu,Davis Wertheimer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlashSinkhorn, a GPU-efficient solver for entropic optimal transport (EOT) that substantially reduces memory and computational overhead compared to existing methods like Sinkhorn iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GPU solvers for EOT are inefficient at scale due to heavy memory traffic and non-fused operations, necessitating an optimized solution.

Method: The proposed method, FlashSinkhorn, retools stabilized Sinkhorn updates as row-wise log-sum-exp operations for bias-normalized scores. It leverages FlashAttention-like fusions and Triton kernels to minimize memory access and run scalable optimization for transport tasks.

Result: FlashSinkhorn demonstrates core speedups of up to 32× in forward passes and 161× end-to-end on A100 GPUs compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling more scalable applications.

Conclusion: FlashSinkhorn introduces a highly efficient, scalable EOT solver for GPU workflows, offering dramatic improvements in speed and memory efficiency, which is crucial for downstream tasks in large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (EOT) via Sinkhorn iterations is widely used in modern machine learning, yet GPU solvers remain inefficient at scale. Tensorized implementations suffer quadratic HBM traffic from dense $n\times m$ interactions, while existing online backends avoid storing dense matrices but still rely on generic tiled map-reduce reduction kernels with limited fusion. We present \textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention. This enables FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling: fused Triton kernels stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass, substantially reducing HBM IO per iteration while retaining linear-memory operations. We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\times$ forward-pass and $161\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks. For reproducibility, we release an open-source implementation at https://github.com/ot-triton-lab/ot_triton.

*Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan,Zijie Liu,Zhen Tan,Charles Fleming,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS), overcoming limitations of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and achieving performance closer to Reinforcement Learning (RL) in training language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and complexity of RL and the catastrophic forgetting issue in SFT caused by supervision mismatch, aiming for an efficient, stable method that preserves model capabilities.

Method: Introduced TMS, a reward-free, dynamic curriculum that uses the model’s historical checkpoints to align training progressively, minimizing policy-label divergence (PLD).

Result: TMS improves performance on reasoning and instruction-following tasks, notably enhancing accuracy and retention compared to standard SFT and iterative SFT, while nearing RL performance.

Conclusion: TMS provides an efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting in SFT, bridging the gap to RL performance without the need for reward models or verifiers while maintaining model retention.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) are the two dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks. While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a class of geometry-aware architectures that preserve geometric structure by interleaving geometric updates between layers. It establishes universal approximation results and explores conditions for learning constraints through data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for preserving geometric structure in machine learning models, particularly for tasks where data resides on manifolds, to improve accuracy and robustness.

Method: The proposed architectures rely on alternating geometric updates guided by discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds. Both analytic and learned projections are used, with connections to heat-kernel limits for unknown constraints.

Result: The framework demonstrates feasibility and strong performance on tasks involving dynamics on S^2 and SO(3), and on S^{d-1}-valued features for both exact analytical and learned projections.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new class of geometry-aware models with universal approximation properties, enhancing model capabilities for constrained datasets on manifolds while offering practical implementation strategies.

Abstract: Preserving geometric structure is important in learning. We propose a unified class of geometry-aware architectures that interleave geometric updates between layers, where both projection layers and intrinsic exponential map updates arise as discretizations of projected dynamical systems on manifolds (with or without boundary). Within this framework, we establish universal approximation results for constrained neural ODEs. We also analyze architectures that enforce geometry only at the output, proving a separate universal approximation property that enables direct comparison to interleaved designs. When the constraint set is unknown, we learn projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, showing diffusion/flow-matching can be used as data-based projections. Experiments on dynamics over S^2 and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization methods by adaptively integrating curvature-adaptive properties without additional computational or memory demands.

Method: PRISM leverages innovation-augmented polar decomposition to construct a low-rank quasi-second-order preconditioner for spectral descent methods.

Result: PRISM maintains computational efficiency while suppressing updates in high-variance subspaces and preserving strength in signal-dominated directions.

Conclusion: PRISM offers an advanced spectral optimization approach that integrates anisotropic spectral shaping while minimizing resource costs.

Abstract: We propose PRISM, an optimizer that enhances first-order spectral descent methods like Muon with partial second-order information. It constructs an efficient, low-rank quasi-second-order preconditioner via innovation-augmented polar decomposition. This mechanism enables PRISM to perform anisotropic spectral shaping, which adaptively suppresses updates in high-variance subspaces while preserving update strength in signal-dominated directions. Crucially, this is achieved with minimal computational overhead and zero additional memory compared to first-order baselines. PRISM demonstrates a practical strategy for integrating curvature-adaptive properties into the spectral optimization paradigm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents TextME, a text-only framework to enable modality expansion without paired datasets, demonstrating zero-shot performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of expanding multimodal representations to novel modalities, which is limited by the need for large-scale paired datasets, especially in expert-intensive fields like medical imaging and molecular analysis.

Method: The approach uses a text-only modality expansion framework called TextME, leveraging pretrained contrastive encoders and their geometric structures to project various modalities into a unified LLM embedding space for zero-shot cross-modal transfer.

Result: The study validates that consistent modality gaps enable text-only training to preserve pretrained encoder performance, and demonstrates emergent cross-modal retrieval across unaligned modality pairs, such as audio-to-image and 3D-to-image.

Conclusion: Text-only training proves to be a viable, practical approach for modality expansion without reliance on paired supervision, enabling novel cross-modal retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Expanding multimodal representations to novel modalities is constrained by reliance on large-scale paired datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, text-3D, text-molecule), which are costly and often infeasible in domains requiring expert annotation such as medical imaging and molecular analysis. We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.

### [431] [Scaling Continual Learning with Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03473)
*Meng Lou,Yunxiang Fu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CaRE, a continual learner model using a Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts (BR-MoE) to address very long class-incremental learning (CIL) task sequences. Extensive experiments show it outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long CIL task sequences.

Method: The proposed CaRE employs a Bi-Level Routing Mixture-of-Experts (BR-MoE) mechanism: first dynamically activating task-specific routers, and then dynamically aggregating expert activations, to enhance feature representation learning.

Result: CaRE demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines across various datasets. It is capable of scaling to very long task sequences (100–300 tasks) and achieves significant improvements in CIL tasks.

Conclusion: CaRE proves to be a scalable and effective solution for CIL over long task sequences, paving the way for future advancements in continual learning methods.

Abstract: Continual learning, especially class-incremental learning (CIL), on the basis of a pre-trained model (PTM) has garnered substantial research interest in recent years. However, how to effectively learn both discriminative and comprehensive feature representations while maintaining stability and plasticity over very long task sequences remains an open problem. We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences. Code will be publicly released at https://github.com/LMMMEng/CaRE.git.

### [432] [Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03102)
*Yuki Ichihara,Yuu Jinnai,Kaito Ariu,Eiji Uchibe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) to improve efficiency in text generation without the inference-time costs of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current strong decoding methods for text generation are computationally expensive as they heavily rely on repeated sampling and scoring during inference.

Method: C-GRPO distills the Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding into training by using a group-relative objective to formulate consensus utilities, needing only a utility function and policy samples instead of gold references or curated labels.

Result: Experiments on machine translation and text summarization tasks demonstrate that C-GRPO performs comparably to MBR decoding and surpasses reference-free baseline methods, all with reduced inference-time costs.

Conclusion: C-GRPO offers an efficient alternative to MBR decoding, combining high performance in text generation tasks with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Many strong decoding methods for text generation follow a sample-and-rerank paradigm: they draw multiple candidates, score each under a utility (reward) function using consensus across samples, and return the best one. Although effective, these methods incur high computational costs during inference due to repeated sampling and scoring. Prior attempts to amortize inference-time computation typically rely on gold references, teacher labels, or curated preference data, increasing dataset construction effort and the demand for high-fidelity reward models. We propose Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), which distills Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding into training by formulating the consensus utility as a group-relative objective within GRPO. C-GRPO requires only a utility function and policy samples, without gold references or explicit preference labels. Under ideal conditions, we show that the objective function of C-GRPO is directionally aligned with the gradient of the expected-utility objective underlying MBR decoding, leading to a convergence guarantee. Experiments on machine translation (WMT 2024) and text summarization (XSum) demonstrate that C-GRPO successfully achieves performance comparable to MBR decoding without the associated inference-time overhead, while outperforming reference-free baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the representation learning and robust classification performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs), noting their robustness to degradations and new insights into their internal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the reasons behind the strong downstream classification performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) and to investigate their representation learning.

Method: The study involves layer-wise analysis of token embeddings and the introduction of two sensitivity indicators—directional alignment and head-wise retention of active features under degradations—to understand the robustness of MAEs.

Result: MAEs demonstrate robust classification performance even in the presence of blur, occlusions, and other degradations. They progressively develop class-aware latent spaces and exhibit global attention persistently throughout encoder layers.

Conclusion: MAEs possess robust learning mechanisms and feature representations that lead to strong downstream classification performance, setting them apart from standard Vision Transformers (ViTs).

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) achieve impressive performance in image classification tasks, yet the internal representations they learn remain less understood. This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces VLM-FS-EB, a novel Bayesian deep learning framework using function-space empirical Bayes regularization to address challenges with high-dimensional priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve uncertainty quantification and predictive accuracy in Bayesian deep learning by designing better priors for high-dimensional data.

Method: The paper leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate synthetic semantic context points and uses their embeddings to create functional priors.

Result: VLM-FS-EB performs better compared to various baseline methods in predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, particularly in out-of-distribution tasks and data-scarce environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing Gaussian process priors in high dimensions, improving performance and reliability.

Abstract: Bayesian deep learning (BDL) provides a principled framework for reliable uncertainty quantification by combining deep neural networks with Bayesian inference. A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), enabling direct fine-tuning of quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating error feedback and a memory-efficient approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning methods fail for quantized models due to their non-differentiable parameter space, necessitating approaches that work effectively with discrete optimization.

Method: The proposed QES method incorporates error feedback for high-precision gradients and seed replay to minimize memory usage, enabling effective fine-tuning of quantized LLMs.

Result: QES outperforms existing methods in zeroth-order fine-tuning, particularly on arithmetic reasoning tasks, demonstrating the potential for fully scaling quantized LLMs.

Conclusion: QES successfully addresses the limitations of fine-tuning on quantized models, making it feasible to optimize and scale LLMs entirely in the quantized space.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on memory-constrained devices, yet it renders models static and difficult to fine-tune. Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space. The source code is available at https://github.com/dibbla/Quantized-Evolution-Strategies .

Result: SATORIS-N outperforms conventional matrix completion methods (SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, etc.) and deep learning approaches, especially under high occlusion in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is robust and generalized, enabling reliable reconstruction in spatiotemporal contexts, aiding intelligent vehicle systems in handling sparse or faulty data during navigation.

Abstract: Traffic-density matrices from different days exhibit both low rank and stable correlations in their singular-vector subspaces. Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density
  reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization. When infrastructure sensors or vehicle-reported observations are incomplete - due to communication dropouts, sensor occlusions, or sparse connected vehicle penetration-reliable imputation becomes essential for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.

*Fanxiao Wani Qiu,Oscar Leong,Alexander LaTourrette*

TL;DR: The study explores how humans select informative examples for teaching using computational strategies and neural network representations. It finds that joint representativeness and diversity criteria better align with human behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational principles behind human selection of teaching exemplars, which balance representativeness, prototypicality, and diversity.

Method: The paper modeled human exemplar selection using pretrained neural network feature representations and subset selection strategies across novel visual categories.

Result: Human judgments were better captured by strategies that emphasize joint representativeness and diversity. Transformer-based neural networks aligned closer with human behavior than convolutional networks.

Conclusion: Dataset distillation and neural network-based models have significant potential in improving computational imitation of human teaching strategies.

Abstract: Teaching requires distilling a rich category distribution into a small set of informative exemplars. Although prior work shows that humans consider both representativeness and diversity when teaching, the computational principles underlying these tradeoffs remain unclear. We address this gap by modeling human exemplar selection using neural network feature representations and principled subset selection criteria. Novel visual categories were embedded along a one-dimensional morph continuum using pretrained vision models, and selection strategies varied in their emphasis on prototypicality, joint representativeness, and diversity. Adult participants selected one to three exemplars to teach a learner. Model-human comparisons revealed that strategies based on joint representativeness, or its combination with diversity, best captured human judgments, whereas purely prototypical or diversity-based strategies performed worse. Moreover, transformer-based representations consistently aligned more closely with human behavior than convolutional networks. These results highlight the potential utility of dataset distillation methods in machine learning as computational models for teaching.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemCast, a memory-based framework that improves time series forecasting by leveraging hierarchical memory and continual evolution strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based TSF methods lack explicit mechanisms for experience accumulation and continual evolution, which are critical for improving forecasting effectiveness.

Method: MemCast reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task, organizing learned knowledge into hierarchical memory (historical patterns, reasoning wisdom, and general laws). It employs dynamic confidence adaptation to enable continual evolution without test data leakage.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemCast surpasses previous methods in TSF accuracy across multiple datasets, showing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: MemCast offers a novel memory-enhanced approach to TSF, significantly improving forecasting performance and supporting continual learning and evolution of predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a critical role in decision-making for many real-world applications. Recently, LLM-based forecasters have made promising advancements. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods often lack explicit experience accumulation and continual evolution. In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Psychological Regret Model (PRM), improving reinforcement learning by providing regret-based feedback for faster convergence, outperforming methods like PPO in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning often struggles with slow convergence due to sparse or delayed rewards in complex environments.

Method: The PRM computes a regret signal by comparing the value of the optimal action with that of the chosen action at each step, converting sparse rewards into dense feedback signals.

Result: PRM delivers stable performance approximately 36% faster than traditional PPO algorithms in benchmark tasks like Lunar Lander.

Conclusion: PRM bridges behavioral economics and reinforcement learning, showing its effectiveness in tasks requiring fast policy adaptation, such as robotics and finance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from slow convergence due to sparse reward signals, particularly in complex environments where feedback is delayed or infrequent. This paper introduces the Psychological Regret Model (PRM), a novel approach that accelerates learning by incorporating regret-based feedback signals after each decision step. Rather than waiting for terminal rewards, PRM computes a regret signal based on the difference between the expected value of the optimal action and the value of the action taken in each state. This transforms sparse rewards into dense feedback signals through a step-wise scoring framework, enabling faster convergence. We demonstrate that PRM achieves stable performance approximately 36\% faster than traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in benchmark environments such as Lunar Lander. Our results indicate that PRM is particularly effective in continuous control tasks and environments with delayed feedback, making it suitable for real-world applications such as robotics, finance, and adaptive education where rapid policy adaptation is critical. The approach formalizes human-inspired counterfactual thinking as a computable regret signal, bridging behavioral economics and reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel probe-then-commit reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-objective decision-making in online settings, improving performance evaluation efficiency while guaranteeing reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the gap in theoretical understanding and practical algorithms for multi-objective optimization in limited feedback regimes, which are common in online resource selection scenarios like mobile edge computing and multi-radio access.

Method: The authors develop 'PtC-P-UCB,' a probe-then-commit algorithm using a frontier-aware probing strategy. It maximizes a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and employs marginal hypervolume gain for commitment. The approach is extended to multi-modal probing with variance-adaptive uncertainty fusion.

Result: The algorithm achieves a theoretical improvement of $1/\sqrt{q}$ in regret bounds, leading to more efficient decision-making under limited probing. It introduces measurable performance guarantees for both multi-objective and scalarized learning frameworks.

Conclusion: This work bridges classical bandit and full-information learning settings by providing an effective algorithm for intermediate scenarios. It advances understanding and practical methodologies in multi-objective online learning with limited feedback.

Abstract: We study an online resource-selection problem motivated by multi-radio access selection and mobile edge computing offloading. In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q>1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\tilde{O} (K_P d/\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\tilde{O} (L_φd\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $φ$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale.

*Jing-Cheng Pang,Liang Lu,Xian Tang,Kun Jiang,Sijie Wu,Kai Zhang,Xubin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLPT, a framework for improving reinforcement learning in large language models by focusing on a refined subset of actions, leading to better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL approaches for large language models struggle with a vast action space, including irrelevant tokens, which distracts the optimization process. The motivation is to address this inefficiency and focus on meaningful decision-making.

Method: RLPT reduces the action space by identifying promising tokens through semantic priors of the base model and constraining the policy optimization to this subset via masking, ensuring a more focused learning process.

Result: RLPT significantly reduces gradient variance, stabilizes RL training, improves sample efficiency, and achieves better performance across tasks like math, coding, and reasoning, tested on diverse model sizes and RL algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed RLPT framework refines reinforcement learning in LLMs by concentrating on meaningful token subsets, enhancing training stability, efficiency, and task performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).

TL;DR: SLOPE addresses sparse reward issues in model-based reinforcement learning by constructing informative potential landscapes instead of regressing scalar rewards. It shows improved performance across over 30 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of sparse reward settings in model-based reinforcement learning, where standard scalar reward regression leads to ineffective directional guidance for planning.

Method: SLOPE introduces optimistic distributional regression to construct potential landscapes, amplifying sparse success signals and providing exploration gradients.

Result: SLOPE outperformed leading baselines in more than 30 tasks across multiple benchmarks for different reward settings: fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense.

Conclusion: SLOPE enhances reward modeling in MBRL, improving exploration and overall effectiveness in various tasks and reward conditions.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) achieves high sample efficiency by simulating future trajectories with learned dynamics and reward models. However, its effectiveness is severely compromised in sparse reward settings. The core limitation lies in the standard paradigm of regressing ground-truth scalar rewards: in sparse environments, this yields a flat, gradient-free landscape that fails to provide directional guidance for planning. To address this challenge, we propose Shaping Landscapes with Optimistic Potential Estimates (SLOPE), a novel framework that shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes. SLOPE employs optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, which amplifies rare success signals and ensures sufficient exploration gradients. Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks demonstrate that SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense rewards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures using tropical geometry, demonstrating their unique geometric and combinatorial expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical basis of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures from a geometric and algebraic perspective, beyond heuristic explanations.

Method: The authors employ tropical geometry to relate MoE's top-$k$ routing mechanism to elementary symmetric tropical polynomial and analyze the input space through the Normal Fan of a Hypersimplex.

Result: The study shows that MoE architectures achieve combinatorial resilience and maintain high expressivity, compared to dense networks, which face capacity collapse on low-dimensional data.

Conclusion: This research provides a unified framework linking discrete and continuous geometry, rigorously supporting MoE architectures as superior for conditional computation.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures define the state-of-the-art, their theoretical success is often attributed to heuristic efficiency rather than geometric expressivity. In this work, we present the first analysis of MoE through the lens of tropical geometry, establishing that the Top-$k$ routing mechanism is algebraically isomorphic to the $k$-th elementary symmetric tropical polynomial. This isomorphism partitions the input space into the Normal Fan of a Hypersimplex, revealing that \textbf{sparsity is combinatorial depth} which scales geometric capacity by the binomial coefficient $\binom{N}{k}$. Moving beyond ambient bounds, we introduce the concept of \textit{Effective Capacity} under the Manifold Hypothesis. We prove that while dense networks suffer from capacity collapse on low-dimensional data, MoE architectures exhibit \textit{Combinatorial Resilience}, maintaining high expressivity via the transversality of routing cones. In this study, our framework unifies the discrete geometry of the Hypersimplex with the continuous geometry of neural functions, offering a rigorous theoretical justification for the topological supremacy of conditional computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiDAR sampling, an efficient method for aligning diffusion model outputs with human intent by avoiding high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limitations of current gradient guidance methods in aligning diffusion model outputs with human preferences.

Method: The proposed method computes expected future rewards (EFR) without neural backpropagation using marginal samples from pre-trained diffusion models. It incorporates lookahead sampling and a solver to guide particles efficiently.

Result: LiDAR sampling achieves significant improvements in performance with reduced computation. For example, it delivers comparable performance to the latest methods for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.

Conclusion: LiDAR sampling provides an efficient and effective solution for aligning generative outputs with human intent, making it computationally feasible and scalable.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance; however, generated samples often fail to fully align with human intent. This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of understanding how local interactions influence global brain organization through multiscale models, focusing on graph-level embeddings.

Method: The authors developed a hierarchical SSL framework that learns embeddings at multiple scales and created a synthetic benchmark mimicking connectome properties to evaluate SSL models.

Result: They found that generic SSL models fail to align with connectome-like topologies and are outperformed by classical approaches targeting topological features.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations of current graph SSL approaches in neuroimaging, calling for the development of topology-aware SSL objectives to better preserve structural properties.

Abstract: Understanding how local interactions give rise to global brain organization requires models that can represent information across multiple scales. We introduce a hierarchical self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that jointly learns node-, edge-, and graph-level embeddings, inspired by multimodal neuroimaging. We construct a controllable synthetic benchmark mimicking the topological properties of connectomes. Our four-stage evaluation protocol reveals a critical failure: the invariance-based SSL model is fundamentally misaligned with the benchmark's topological properties and is catastrophically outperformed by classical, topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch: SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore the very community structure that classical methods exploit. Our results expose a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data. We present this framework as a cautionary case study, highlighting the need for new, topology-aware SSL objectives for neuro-AI research that explicitly reward the preservation of structure (e.g., modularity or motifs).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve black-box optimization, a challenging task especially in high-dimensional settings, by leveraging the strengths of classical optimization and Bayesian approaches.

Method: BayeSQP uses second-order Gaussian processes to model objective and constraints, formulates a subproblem as a second-order cone program considering uncertainties, and selects new points via constrained Thompson sampling.

Result: Empirical testing demonstrates BayeSQP outperforming state-of-the-art methods in certain high-dimensional optimization problems.

Conclusion: BayeSQP provides a principled framework that combines classical methods with modern Bayesian optimization techniques for effective black-box optimization.

Abstract: We introduce BayeSQP, a novel algorithm for general black-box optimization that merges the structure of sequential quadratic programming with concepts from Bayesian optimization. BayeSQP employs second-order Gaussian process surrogates for both the objective and constraints to jointly model the function values, gradients, and Hessian from only zero-order information. At each iteration, a local subproblem is constructed using the GP posterior estimates and solved to obtain a search direction. Crucially, the formulation of the subproblem explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the function and derivative estimates, resulting in a tractable second-order cone program for high probability improvements under model uncertainty. A subsequent one-dimensional line search via constrained Thompson sampling selects the next evaluation point. Empirical results show thatBayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings. Our algorithm offers a principled and flexible framework that bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find frequent subgraph patterns in neural architectures, an essential task for optimizing design efficiency and gaining structural insights, while overcoming the limitations of enumeration-based and sampling-based methods.

Method: GraDE uses a novel Graph Diffusion Estimator, integrating graph diffusion models to score subgraph typicality within a learned distribution, balancing computational feasibility and discovery capability.

Result: Experiments show that GraDE achieves up to 114% better ranking accuracy and enables the discovery of frequent patterns with up to 30× higher median frequency compared to sampling-based methods.

Conclusion: GraDE successfully combines computational efficiency and high discovery capability, emerging as an effective tool for analyzing neural architectures.

Abstract: Finding frequently occurring subgraph patterns or network motifs in neural architectures is crucial for optimizing efficiency, accelerating design, and uncovering structural insights. However, as the subgraph size increases, enumeration-based methods are perfectly accurate but computationally prohibitive, while sampling-based methods are computationally tractable but suffer from a severe decline in discovery capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraDE, a diffusion-guided search framework that ensures both computational feasibility and discovery capability. The key innovation is the Graph Diffusion Estimator (GraDE), which is the first to introduce graph diffusion models to identify frequent subgraphs by scoring their typicality within the learned distribution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the estimator achieves superior ranking accuracy, with up to 114\% improvement compared to sampling-based baselines. Benefiting from this, the proposed framework successfully discovers large-scale frequent patterns, achieving up to 30$\times$ higher median frequency than sampling-based methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring robust safety alignment in LLMs, given the rise of adversarial jailbreak attacks that bypass safeguards.

Method: The study uses the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack as a case study to explore the influence of adversarial token positioning within the prompt, comparing prefix and suffix optimization strategies.

Result: Findings reveal that adversarial token placement (e.g., prefixes) significantly affects attack success rates, exposing a critical blind spot in current safety assessments of LLMs.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness evaluations of LLMs must account for token positioning to improve their defensive capabilities and safety alignment measures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption across multiple domains, creating an urgent need for robust safety alignment mechanisms. However, robustness remains challenging due to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment via adversarial prompts. In this work, we focus on the prevalent Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack and identify a previously underexplored attack axis in jailbreak attacks typically framed as suffix-based: the placement of adversarial tokens within the prompt. Using GCG as a case study, we show that both optimizing attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varying adversarial token position during evaluation substantially influence attack success rates. Our findings highlight a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations and underline the need to account for the position of adversarial tokens in the adversarial robustness evaluation of LLMs.

Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting hidden toxicity in multimodal data, reconciling the gap where seemingly benign individual materials become harmful in combination.

Method: Introduces Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs) to model semantic associations and the MTC metric to measure covert toxic content. Also constructs a benchmark dataset, Covert Toxic Dataset, for rigorous testing.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods in identifying both low- and high-covertness toxicity while providing interpretable results.

Conclusion: This work enhances the understanding and identification of covert multimodal toxicity by integrating explainable frameworks and metrics, pushing the boundaries of transparency in this field.

Abstract: Detecting toxicity in multimodal data remains a significant challenge, as harmful meanings often lurk beneath seemingly benign individual modalities: only emerging when modalities are combined and semantic associations are activated. To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified and generalized mechanism for label differential privacy that eliminates the need for separate analyses of individual randomized-response mechanisms.

Method: The authors developed BlockRR, a randomized-response framework, and provided a theoretical proof for its ε-label differential privacy. They also designed a weight-matrix-based partition method that ensures its privacy under composition.

Result: BlockRR achieved better test accuracy and per-class accuracy balance in high- and moderate-privacy settings ($ε \leq 3.0$) on imbalanced CIFAR-10 data. In low-privacy settings ($ε \geq 4.0$), it matches standard RR performance.

Conclusion: BlockRR offers a flexible, privacy-preserving mechanism applicable across varying privacy regimes, surpassing or matching existing methods in performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BlockRR, a novel and unified randomized-response mechanism for label differential privacy. This framework generalizes existed RR-type mechanisms as special cases under specific parameter settings, which eliminates the need for separate, case-by-case analysis. Theoretically, we prove that BlockRR satisfies $ε$-label DP. We also design a partition method for BlockRR based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information; the parallel composition principle ensures that the composition of two such mechanisms remains $ε$-label DP. Empirically, we evaluate BlockRR on two variants of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance. Results show that in the high-privacy and moderate-privacy regimes ($ε\leq 3.0$), our propsed method gets a better balance between test accuaracy and the average of per-class accuracy. In the low-privacy regime ($ε\geq 4.0$), all methods reduce BlockRR to standard RR without additional performance loss.

Motivation: This research addresses a theoretical justification for widely-used design patterns in operator learning and imaging, specifically for approximating continuous functionals in mathematical spaces.

Method: The authors leverage mathematical analysis to show how continuous functional approximations can be constructed through finite linear measurements and scalar nonlinearities. They extend their results to Banach spaces for finite-rank approximations.

Result: The study demonstrates that the proposed methods can uniformly approximate continuous functionals on compact subsets and extend to mappings valued in Banach spaces.

Conclusion: The findings support the theoretical foundation of common "measure, apply scalar nonlinearities, then combine" approaches, enhancing their credibility and utility in operator learning and imaging.

Abstract: We study universal approximation of continuous functionals on compact subsets of products of Hilbert spaces. We prove that any such functional can be uniformly approximated by models that first take finitely many continuous linear measurements of the inputs and then combine these measurements through continuous scalar nonlinearities. We also extend the approximation principle to maps with values in a Banach space, yielding finite-rank approximations. These results provide a compact-set justification for the common ``measure, apply scalar nonlinearities, then combine'' design pattern used in operator learning and imaging.

Result: MSDE demonstrated strong, consistent performance across multiple datasets, anomaly types, and noise levels compared to 13 unsupervised baselines using metrics like AUC-ROC and AUC-PR.

Conclusion: MSDE provides a robust, scalable alternative for unsupervised anomaly detection by effectively capturing geometric responses to density enhancement and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection stands as an important problem in machine learning, with applications in financial fraud prevention, network security and medical diagnostics. Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection.

### [454] [Lipschitz Multiscale Deep Equilibrium Models: A Theoretically Guaranteed and Accelerated Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03297)
*Naoki Sato,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lipschitz multiscale DEQ is proposed to solve Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) fixed-point convergence issues, achieving significant speed-up with minor accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEQs offer an efficient alternative to traditional deep networks by avoiding memory-intensive stacking of layers. However, the lack of fixed-point convergence in training and inference renders DEQs computationally expensive.

Method: The study proposes a Lipschitz multiscale DEQ architecture that guarantees fixed-point convergence by restructuring the model and tuning hyperparameters for both forward and backward passes.

Result: A speed-up of up to 4.75× was achieved in image classification tasks on CIFAR-10, though there was a small drop in accuracy.

Conclusion: Lipschitz multiscale DEQ significantly reduces computational overhead with theoretical guaranteed convergence, offering a promising alternative for balancing efficiency and performance in DEQs.

Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) achieve infinitely deep network representations without stacking layers by exploring fixed points of layer transformations in neural networks. Such models constitute an innovative approach that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in many large-scale numerical experiments, despite requiring significantly less memory. However, DEQs face the challenge of requiring vastly more computational time for training and inference than conventional methods, as they repeatedly perform fixed-point iterations with no convergence guarantee upon each input. Therefore, this study explored an approach to improve fixed-point convergence and consequently reduce computational time by restructuring the model architecture to guarantee fixed-point convergence. Our proposed approach for image classification, Lipschitz multiscale DEQ, has theoretically guaranteed fixed-point convergence for both forward and backward passes by hyperparameter adjustment, achieving up to a 4.75$\times$ speed-up in numerical experiments on CIFAR-10 at the cost of a minor drop in accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Periodic Regularized Q-learning (PRQ), extending Q-learning with regularization techniques for stable convergence under linear function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Q-learning's convergence is not guaranteed under linear function approximation, creating a need for stable methods.

Method: Developed PRQ by incorporating regularization at the projection operator level and extending it to a stochastic RL setting with theoretical analysis.

Result: Finite-time convergence guarantees for PRQ under linear function approximation are proven theoretically.

Conclusion: PRQ ensures stable and finite-time convergence in RL tasks using linear function approximation.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), Q-learning is a fundamental algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed in the tabular setting. However, this convergence guarantee does not hold under linear function approximation. To overcome this limitation, a significant line of research has introduced regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence under function approximation. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, periodic regularized Q-learning (PRQ). We first introduce regularization at the level of the projection operator and explicitly construct a regularized projected value iteration (RP-VI), subsequently extending it to a sample-based RL algorithm. By appropriately regularizing the projection operator, the resulting projected value iteration becomes a contraction. By extending this regularized projection into the stochastic setting, we establish the PRQ algorithm and provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that proves finite-time convergence guarantees for PRQ under linear function approximation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate reward design for Reinforcement Learning in clinical treatment, potentially enhancing policy outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reward engineering in clinical RL, which is pivotal for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes but limited by reliance on manual and non-generalizable heuristics.

Method: They propose an automated pipeline utilizing LLMs to design and validate reward functions by combining components such as survival, confidence, and competence, along with introducing quantitative metrics for validation.

Result: The framework allows automated reward design tailored to specific diseases and significantly improves policy performance by leveraging domain knowledge through LLMs.

Conclusion: This approach advances RL in clinical settings by offering a scalable, generalizable solution to reward engineering, improving policy learning and adaptability across varied diseases.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs). However, clinical RL is fundamentally bottlenecked by reward engineering: the challenge of defining signals that safely and effectively guide policy learning in complex, sparse offline environments. Existing approaches often rely on manual heuristics that fail to generalize across diverse pathologies. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline reward design and verification. We formulate the reward function using potential functions consisted of three core components: survival, confidence, and competence. We further introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select the optimal reward structure prior to deployment. By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, our framework automates the design of reward functions for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of the resulting policies.

*Yuelin Hu,Zhengxue Cheng,Wei Liu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents EGSPO, a hybrid training framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with token-level modulation to improve language model performance on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks, requiring innovative training methods to enhance their reliability and performance.

Method: EGSPO involves three stages: supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning with entropy computation, and entropy-based token-level gradient modulation to balance exploration and stability.

Result: EGSPO improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 3.8% gain on AIME and 2.9% on MATH, surpassing the previous baseline, CHORD phi.

Conclusion: EGSPO effectively enhances mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating its potential in refining hybrid training frameworks.

Abstract: Hybrid training methods for large language models combine supervised fine tuning (SFT) on expert demonstrations with reinforcement learning (RL) on model rollouts, typically at the sample level. We propose Entropy Gated Selective Policy Optimization (EGSPO), a three stage framework that extends sample level mixing with token level gradient modulation.
  Stage 1, SFT expert learning, establishes a reliable warm up policy using expert demonstrations with a pure SFT loss. Stage 2, RL rollout generation, samples trajectories from the current policy and computes per token predictive entropy. Stage 3, the EGSPO mechanism, applies entropy gated gradient allocation: a predictive entropy module routes high entropy tokens to full PPO updates to encourage exploration, and low entropy tokens to attenuated PPO updates to reduce variance and preserve knowledge. Critically, both branches incorporate the advantage function A_t, ensuring that incorrect trajectories receive consistent negative learning signals and preventing reinforcement of confident errors.
  EGSPO achieves consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with gains of 3.8 percent on AIME and 2.9 percent on MATH over the CHORD phi baseline, while incurring only 3.4 percent additional computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents an information-theoretic framework for adaptive sampling in high-dimensional design spaces under limited evaluation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable target-oriented discovery in high-dimensional and heterogeneous design spaces while dealing with costly evaluations.

Method: Reframes optimization as trajectory discovery, using information-theoretic principles and incorporating adaptive methodologies such as bootstrapped distillation and candidate manifold analysis.

Result: Demonstrated improved efficiency and reliability over 14 materials design tasks with varying candidate pool sizes and feature dimensions. Robustness also shown in synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances exploitation and exploration for efficient target discovery, showcasing its robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Target-oriented discovery under limited evaluation budgets requires making reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each new measurement is costly, whether experimental or high-fidelity simulation. We present an information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that reframes optimization as trajectory discovery: instead of approximating the full response surface, the method maintains and refines a low-entropy information state that concentrates search on target-relevant directions. The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Complementary 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel) further demonstrate robustness to rugged and multimodal landscapes.

*Renaud Gaucher,Aymeric Dieuleveut,Hadrien Hendrikx*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of traditional federated learning algorithms to adversarial nodes and proposes novel accelerated optimization schemes for improved Byzantine robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard federated learning algorithms are susceptible to malicious nodes (Byzantine failures), hindering secure and efficient model training.

Method: The paper connects robust distributed optimization to inexact gradient oracle analysis and introduces two acceleration approaches: Nesterov-type acceleration and Optimization under Similarity.

Result: The proposed solutions achieve optimal asymptotic error and significantly reduce communication complexity compared to existing robust methods, demonstrated both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: By reformulating Byzantine-robust distributed learning, the work enables accelerated algorithms and improved communication efficiency, enhancing robustness in federated learning.

Abstract: Standard federated learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial nodes, a.k.a. Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research.
  This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically.

TL;DR: The study introduces Bayesian Conformal Prediction (BCP) using Bayesian posterior predictive densities and quadrature to deliver reliable prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in providing prediction sets with valid guarantees, even under model misspecifications and difficult settings such as distribution shifts.

Method: Utilizes Bayesian posterior predictive densities and Bayesian quadrature within a split conformal framework to create accurate prediction sets.

Result: BCP achieves valid empirical coverage even under model misspecification and shows lower variability in prediction set size compared to alternatives like split conformal prediction.

Conclusion: BCP offers a practical and reliable approach to prediction set construction in regression and classification tasks, outperforming Bayesian credible intervals in sparse regression scenarios under misspecifications.

Abstract: Bayesian posterior predictive densities as non-conformity scores and Bayesian quadrature are used to estimate and minimise the expected prediction set size. Operating within a split conformal framework, BCP provides valid coverage guarantees and demonstrates reliable empirical coverage under model misspecification. Across regression and classification tasks, including distribution-shifted settings such as ImageNet-A, BCP yields prediction sets of comparable size to split conformal prediction, while exhibiting substantially lower run-to-run variability in set size. In sparse regression with nominal coverage of 80 percent, BCP achieves 81 percent empirical coverage under a misspecified prior, whereas Bayesian credible intervals under-cover at 49 percent.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new algorithm for unraveling causal graphs using an invariance-based test that is efficient and faster than prior methods, achieving superior results on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to improve the efficiency and scalability of causal graph recovery from observational data, while maintaining or enhancing the performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Method: The proposed method utilizes an invariance-based test on the conditional distribution of an effect given its causes over subsets with varied prior distributions. The algorithm capitalizes on the sparsity of causal graphs and has quadratic complexity.

Result: The results demonstrate that the algorithm provides a processing time improvement of up to 25x over existing methods, while achieving better or equivalent accuracy on a set of large-scale benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the introduced framework is a scalable and efficient alternative for recovering causal relationships, achieving cutting-edge performance and significantly reducing computational demands.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for recovering causal graphs from observational data, leveraging the observation that the distribution of an effect, conditioned on its causes, remains invariant to changes in the prior distribution of those causes. This insight enables a direct test for potential causal relationships by checking the variance of their corresponding effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets of the data. These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical experiments on a varied benchmark of large-scale datasets show superior or equivalent performance compared to existing works, while achieving enhanced scalability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedNMap, a federated learning method addressing nonsmooth regularizers and data heterogeneity for better speedup in nonconvex composite settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve federated learning in handling nonsmooth regularizers and data heterogeneity across clients while achieving better speedup performance in nonconvex composite models.

Method: FedNMap employs a normal map-based update strategy alongside local correction mechanisms to address data heterogeneity across clients and the challenges posed by nonsmooth regularizers.

Result: FedNMap shows linear speedup in federated learning with respect to the number of clients and local updates, tackling both nonconvex losses under Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition and without it.

Conclusion: The method establishes a significant advancement by demonstrating linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning, addressing a gap in current research.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedNMap, a normal map-based method for composite federated learning, where the objective consists of a smooth loss and a possibly nonsmooth regularizer. FedNMap leverages a normal map-based update scheme to handle the nonsmooth term and incorporates a local correction strategy to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across clients. Under standard assumptions, including smooth local losses, weak convexity of the regularizer, and bounded stochastic gradient variance, FedNMap achieves linear speedup with respect to both the number of clients $n$ and the number of local updates $Q$ for nonconvex losses, both with and without the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing linear speedup for nonconvex composite federated learning.

*Sangyeon Yoon,Hyesoo Hong,Wonje Jeung,Albert No*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study finds that syntactic similarity, not topicality, drives benign relearning in machine unlearning. Syntactic diversification is proposed to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of existing machine unlearning methods due to benign relearning, where forgotten content reemerges, challenging the effectiveness of unlearning models.

Method: The authors analyze the drivers of benign relearning and propose syntactic diversification by paraphrasing forget queries into diverse structures to counter the issue.

Result: Syntactic diversification suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and improves the balance between effective unlearning and maintaining model utility.

Conclusion: Syntactic similarity is the key factor behind benign relearning, and syntactic diversification proves effective in enhancing unlearning processes while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific content from trained models while preserving overall performance. However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes PPO's theoretical foundations, providing insights into convergence and advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical gaps in PPO's policy update scheme and enhance its effectiveness.

Method: The paper interprets PPO's updates as approximated policy gradient ascent, controls bias in surrogate gradients, uses random reshuffling techniques, and proposes weight corrections for Generalized Advantage Estimation.

Result: Convergence theorem for PPO was proven, bias control was analyzed, and a solution for mass collapse issue showed empirical improvements.

Conclusion: PPO's theoretical basis was clarified, convergence explained, and performance improved for specific environments.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is among the most widely used deep reinforcement learning algorithms, yet its theoretical foundations remain incomplete. Most importantly, convergence and understanding of fundamental PPO advantages remain widely open. Under standard theory assumptions we show how PPO's policy update scheme (performing multiple epochs of minibatch updates on multi-use rollouts with a surrogate gradient) can be interpreted as approximated policy gradient ascent. We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success. Additionally, we identify a previously overlooked issue in truncated Generalized Advantage Estimation commonly used in PPO. The geometric weighting scheme induces infinite mass collapse onto the longest $k$-step advantage estimator at episode boundaries. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction can yield substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signal, such as Lunar Lander.

*Jinwoo Choi,Sang-Hyun Lee,Seung-Woo Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a method for improving long-horizon tasks in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by using autoregressive subgoal modeling and an MLP-Mixer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hierarchical decision-making struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they typically generate a single subgoal and rely on separate networks for high- and low-level policies. This limits their ability to coordinate multiple intermediate decisions effectively.

Method: The authors propose CoGHP, a unified framework that uses autoregressive sequence modeling to generate a chain of latent subgoals and corresponding actions. It employs an MLP-Mixer backbone to enable cross-token communication and capture relationships between state, goal, subgoals, and actions.

Result: CoGHP demonstrated superior performance compared to strong offline baselines across navigation and manipulation benchmarks, particularly in challenging long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: CoGHP successfully enhances hierarchical decision-making in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by integrating subgoal reasoning within a unified architecture, achieving improved outcomes for complex tasks.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning remains challenging for long-horizon tasks. While hierarchical approaches mitigate this issue by decomposing tasks, most existing methods rely on separate high- and low-level networks and generate only a single intermediate subgoal, making them inadequate for complex tasks that require coordinating multiple intermediate decisions. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought paradigm and propose the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a novel framework that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given a state and a final goal, CoGHP autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by the primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step that conditions subsequent predictions. To implement this efficiently, we pioneer the use of an MLP-Mixer backbone, which supports cross-token communication and captures structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action. Across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and optimize the role of entropy in maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation during LLM fine-tuning, which has not been thoroughly investigated.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze entropy dynamics, derive mathematical expressions for entropy change during single logit updates, extend the analysis to GRPO, and propose entropy control methods inspired by their insights.

Result: The study provides empirical evidence supporting its theoretical conclusions, demonstrates the effectiveness of its proposed entropy-discriminator clipping methods, and offers a unified perspective on entropy-based methods.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding of entropy dynamics in LLM fine-tuning, equips researchers with theoretical and practical tools, and improves optimization of exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Abstract: Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the misalignment issue in financial forecasting, proposing that training labels do not always align with prediction goals due to market dynamics. It introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework to improve forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of training label design in financial forecasting and determine how the supervision signal affects model performance.

Method: A bi-level optimization framework that autonomously finds the optimal proxy label to address the Label Horizon Paradox, ensuring better generalization by balancing signal realization and noise accumulation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated consistent improvements over baseline methods on extensive financial datasets.

Conclusion: The study reveals the importance of label design in financial forecasting, introducing a dynamic approach that adapts supervision signals, with significant performance gains and new research opportunities.

Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial examples in random CNNs can exist at an optimal \(\ell_2\)-distance, derived through Fourier decomposition and gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance understanding of adversarial examples in CNNs, a topic less explored compared to fully connected networks.

Method: Utilizes Fourier decomposition to bound singular values of random convolutional operators and employs gradient descent to find adversarial perturbations.

Result: It proves adversarial examples in random CNNs can exist at \(\ell_2\)-distance \(\lVert x \rVert /\sqrt{d} \) and can be identified in one gradient descent step.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the optimality of adversarial examples' distance in random CNNs and the utility of Fourier decomposition for deriving such results.

Abstract: The existence of adversarial examples is relatively understood for random fully connected neural networks, but much less so for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The recent work [Daniely, 2025] establishes that adversarial examples can be found in CNNs, in some non-optimal distance from the input. We extend over this work and prove that adversarial examples in random CNNs with input dimension $d$ can be found already in $\ell_2$-distance of order $\lVert x \rVert /\sqrt{d}$ from the input $x$, which is essentially the nearest possible. We also show that such adversarial small perturbations can be found using a single step of gradient descent. To derive our results we use Fourier decomposition to efficiently bound the singular values of a random linear convolutional operator, which is the main ingredient of a CNN layer. This bound might be of independent interest.

### [469] [Beyond Variance: Prompt-Efficient RLVR via Rare-Event Amplification and Bidirectional Pairing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03452)
*Xin Sheng,Jiaxin Li,Yujuan Pang,Ran Peng,Yong Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes improvements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models, introducing a method of positive-negative pairing and Weighted GRPO, which result in better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address issues in RLVR where prompt selection based solely on training-accuracy variance often leads to unstable optimization and weaker transfer of learning.

Method: A new prompt selection method, positive-negative pairing, is introduced, where each minibatch includes a hard-but-solvable prompt (q+) and an easy-but-flawed prompt (q-). Weighted GRPO reweights binary outcomes at the pair level to emphasize rare successes and penalize rare failures, amplifying learning signals.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the baseline, achieving higher Pass scores (e.g., from 16.8 to 22.2 on AIME 2025 Pass@8) and comparable accuracy to large-scale RLVR setups, using fewer prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms provide more reliable optimization, efficient sample usage, and improved outcomes, demonstrating their utility for training language models on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is effective for training large language models on deterministic outcome reasoning tasks. Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts.

### [470] [Causal Inference on Networks under Misspecified Exposure Mappings: A Partial Identification Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03459)
*Maresa Schröder,Miruna Oprescu,Stefan Feuerriegel,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel partial identification framework to assess treatment effect robustness in network causal inference under misspecified exposure mappings, deriving bounds for direct and spillover effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating treatment effects in networks rely heavily on exposure mappings, which, if incorrect, significantly bias results. This motivates the need for a more robust approach.

Method: Sharp upper and lower bounds on treatment effects are derived using a new partial identification framework. The framework is instantiated in three common exposure scenarios and applies causal sensitivity analysis.

Result: Orthogonal estimators for the bounds are developed and shown to be valid, sharp, and efficient. Experiments confirm that the bounds remain reliable and informative even when exposure mappings are misspecified.

Conclusion: The framework enhances causal inference on networks by providing robust, reliable bounds under exposure mapping uncertainties, improving the reliability of conclusions in network treatment effect studies.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.

*Mingxuan Wang,Cheng Chen,Gaoyang Jiang,Zijia Ren,Chuangxin Zhao,Lu Shi,Yanbiao Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion model designed for generating single-cell RNA-seq data, ensuring better biological coherence and generation efficiency by leveraging a novel approach beyond autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell RNA-seq data possess unique challenges such as high dimensionality, sparsity, and disordered structure that lead to biases and accumulated errors in typical autoregressive models.

Method: The proposed scDiVa model employs a masked discrete diffusion mechanism that mimics dropout corruption, utilizing a bidirectional denoiser for precise modeling of discrete gene identities and continuous values. It incorporates depth-invariant sampling, normalized serialization, and a latent anchor token for better optimization.

Result: scDiVa, pre-trained on 59 million cells, demonstrates high-performance results in benchmarks such as batch integration, cell type annotation, and predicting perturbation responses, indicating broad transferability.

Conclusion: The study establishes that masked discrete diffusion is a powerful and biologically relevant methodology that addresses key challenges in single-cell RNA-seq generation, outperforming autoregressive models.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq profiles are high-dimensional, sparse, and unordered, causing autoregressive generation to impose an artificial ordering bias and suffer from error accumulation. To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction. These results suggest that masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregression.

*Elena Umili,Francesco Argenziano,Roberto Capobianco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepDFA integrates deterministic finite automata (DFA) and neural networks, enabling temporal logic integration into neural networks for better performance in sequential tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a challenge in integrating logical and temporal knowledge into deep neural networks, especially in domains involving sequential and subsymbolic data.

Method: DeepDFA introduces deterministic finite automata (DFA) or Moore Machines as differentiable layers in deep learning, allowing temporal logic to be embedded into neural networks.

Result: DeepDFA achieves state-of-the-art performances in tasks like image sequence classification and learning in non-Markovian environments, outperforming traditional and novel systems.

Conclusion: DeepDFA successfully combines symbolic reasoning with subsymbolic learning, enhancing performance in sequential and temporally extended domains.

Abstract: Integrating logical knowledge into deep neural network training is still a hard challenge, especially for sequential or temporally extended domains involving subsymbolic observations. To address this problem, we propose DeepDFA, a neurosymbolic framework that integrates high-level temporal logic - expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Moore Machines - into neural architectures. DeepDFA models temporal rules as continuous, differentiable layers, enabling symbolic knowledge injection into subsymbolic domains. We demonstrate how DeepDFA can be used in two key settings: (i) static image sequence classification, and (ii) policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments. Across extensive experiments, DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and novel neuro-symbolic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration. These results highlight the potential of DeepDFA to bridge subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the trade-offs in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques and introduces a new approach using intermediate components for better balance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance-forgetting trade-offs in adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks under constraints.

Method: Analyzed low-rank adaptation using principal components for initialization and proposed using intermediate components for more balanced adaptation.

Result: Improved task performance, reduced forgetting, and robustness across various computer vision and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Intermediate component initialization in LoRA leads to better trade-offs, reducing forgetting and enhancing downstream task performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods have emerged as crucial techniques for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks under computational and memory constraints. However, they face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, where existing methods provide inconsistent recommendations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance-forgetting trade-offs inherent in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. Our investigation reveals that fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and show more robustness to high learning rates than first (PiSSA) and last (MiLoRA) components in existing work. Building on these findings, we provide a practical approach for initialization of LoRA that offers superior trade-offs. We demonstrate in a thorough empirical study on a variety of computer vision and NLP tasks that our approach improves accuracy and reduces forgetting, also in continual learning scenarios.

*Xuejie Liu,Yap Vit Chun,Yitao Liang,Anji Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve inference performance in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) by proposing a novel objective and search framework to optimize unmasking paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing strategies for unmasking in dLLMs rely on heuristics that focus on local optimization, lacking global consistency and accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce 'Path LL', a trajectory-conditioned objective for assessing unmasking paths, and 'POKE', an efficient value estimator integrated within POKE-SMC, a Sequential Monte Carlo search framework for optimizing unmasking paths at inference time.

Result: Experiments across 6 reasoning tasks demonstrate a consistent 2%-3% accuracy improvement using POKE-SMC over strong baselines with comparable inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances downstream task accuracy and improves the computational efficiency for unmasking in dLLMs, advancing the Pareto frontier of accuracy vs. compute trade-off.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) support arbitrary-order generation, yet their inference performance critically depends on the unmasking order. Existing strategies rely on heuristics that greedily optimize local confidence, offering limited guidance for identifying unmasking paths that are globally consistent and accurate. To bridge this gap, we introduce path log-likelihood (Path LL), a trajectory-conditioned objective that strongly correlates with downstream accuracy and enables principled selection of unmasking paths. To optimize Path LL at inference time, we propose POKE, an efficient value estimator that predicts the expected future Path LL of a partial decoding trajectory. We then integrate this lookahead signal into POKE-SMC, a Sequential Monte Carlo-based search framework for dynamically identifying optimal unmasking paths. Extensive experiments across 6 reasoning tasks show that POKE-SMC consistently improves accuracy, achieving 2%--3% average gains over strong decoding-time scaling baselines at comparable inference overhead on LLaDA models and advancing the accuracy--compute Pareto frontier.

*Hai Zhong,Zhuoran Li,Xun Wang,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO) improves reinforcement learning by combining flow policies with a reparameterization framework for high sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RPG approaches are limited to Gaussian policies and miss the potential of advanced generative models, affecting performance and limiting exploration.

Method: RFO integrates flow policies and reparameterization for generating actions through ODE integration and dynamics backpropagation. It incorporates specific regularization terms for stability and supports action chunking.

Result: RFO demonstrates superior performance across diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, achieving nearly double the reward of state-of-the-art baselines in soft-body quadruped control.

Conclusion: RFO effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RPG frameworks by leveraging flow policies to achieve greater efficiency and performance in model-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reparameterization Policy Gradient (RPG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for model-based reinforcement learning, enabling high sample efficiency by backpropagating gradients through differentiable dynamics. However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PATCHES, a novel algorithm used to discover and analyze circuits in symbolic regression (SR) transformers, providing robust validation to understand these models' inner mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression transformers have demonstrated effectiveness but lack internal mechanistic understanding. The authors aim to explore these mechanisms and establish methods to identify correct circuits in SR models.

Method: The authors develop PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm, and validate its findings using a causal evaluation framework that prioritizes faithfulness, completeness, and minimality.

Result: PATCHES identified 28 circuits in SR transformers, providing the first detailed circuit characterization in this domain. The results demonstrate mean patching with performance evaluations as superior in isolating functionally accurate circuits.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability can effectively be applied to symbolic regression transformers. PATCHES offers a principled approach for circuit discovery, proposing SR as a promising field for such studies.

Abstract: Following their success across many domains, transformers have also proven effective for symbolic regression (SR); however, the internal mechanisms underlying their generation of mathematical operators remain largely unexplored. Although mechanistic interpretability has successfully identified circuits in language and vision models, it has not yet been applied to SR. In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach called Plausible Negative Samples (PNS) to improve reasoning capabilities of large language models by synthesizing high-quality, structured negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing methods overlook the quality of negative samples for enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models and treat all incorrect responses alike, missing the chance to improve their informativeness.

Method: The proposed method, PNS, creates high-quality negative samples using reverse reinforcement learning with a composite reward mechanism considering format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model evaluation, and chain-of-thought assessment.

Result: PNS outperformed other negative sample synthesis methods on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving performance by an average of 2.03% over reinforcement learning (RL)-trained models.

Conclusion: Synthesizing high-quality negative samples using PNS significantly boosts the reasoning capability of LLMs, making it a valuable tool for enhancing preference optimization techniques across various backbones and benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.

*Henri Arno,Dennis Frauen,Emil Javurek,Thomas Demeester,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rank-Learner, a two-stage learner designed for ranking individuals by treatment effects, which is more effective and robust than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in ranking individuals by treatment effects, rather than estimating exact treatment effect magnitudes, crucial for applications like patient prioritization and advertisement impact.

Method: A novel two-stage methodology called Rank-Learner is proposed, optimizing a pairwise objective to recover treatment effect orderings without explicit Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation. It is model-agnostic and has theoretical robustness via Neyman-orthogonality.

Result: Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and alternative non-orthogonal ranking methods in experiments, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper offers practitioners a robust, theoretically-sound, and model-agnostic approach to ranking treatment effects, filling a notable gap in causal learning research.

Abstract: Many decision-making problems require ranking individuals by their treatment effects rather than estimating the exact effect magnitudes. Examples include prioritizing patients for preventive care interventions, or ranking customers by the expected incremental impact of an advertisement. Surprisingly, while causal effect estimation has received substantial attention in the literature, the problem of directly learning rankings of treatment effects has largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods. Overall, we provide practitioners with a new, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by their treatment effects.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting risks in live streaming rooms with sparse malicious behaviors. It introduces AC-MIL, an advanced framework for risk assessment leveraging structured capsules and multi-instance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live streaming platforms face challenges in identifying coordinated malicious behaviors hidden within normal activities, presenting risks to user experiences and platform integrity.

Method: The authors propose a Multiple Instance Learning-based framework, AC-MIL, which models user behaviors through structured user-timeslot capsules and captures multi-granular semantics using temporal and cross-user dynamics to predict risks at room-level.

Result: AC-MIL demonstrates superior performance in risk prediction compared to state-of-the-art baselines using industrial datasets from Douyin. It also provides interpretability by pinpointing risky behavior segments.

Conclusion: AC-MIL effectively advances live streaming risk assessment by addressing weak supervision challenges, offering robust predictions and actionable evidence for interventions.

Abstract: Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve scalability, reduce training costs, and enhance the efficiency of logic neural networks for AI inference.

Method: Introducing WARP, a gradient-based framework utilizing hardware-native logic blocks, learnable thresholding, residual initialization, and stochastic smoothing.

Result: WARP achieves faster convergence, effectively handles deeper architectures, and scales to higher input arity.

Conclusion: WARP resolves limitations of prior approaches, offering a scalable and parameter-efficient solution for logic neural network training.

Abstract: Fast and efficient AI inference is increasingly important, and recent models that directly learn low-level logic operations have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing logic neural networks incur high training costs, introduce redundancy or rely on approximate gradients, which limits scalability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WAlsh Relaxation for Probabilistic (WARP) logic neural networks -- a novel gradient-based framework that efficiently learns combinations of hardware-native logic blocks. We show that WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions and that several prior approaches arise as restricted special cases. Training is improved by introducing learnable thresholding and residual initialization, while we bridge the gap between relaxed training and discrete logic inference through stochastic smoothing. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence than state-of-the-art baselines, while scaling effectively to deeper architectures and logic functions with higher input arity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of neural network training by exploiting sparsity while ensuring competitive accuracy and reduced computational overhead.

Method: The method alternates between static and dynamic sparsity pattern updates, based on Bregman iterations and adaptive freezing techniques, and integrates into a multilevel optimization framework.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves highly sparse and accurate models on benchmarks, reducing theoretical FLOPs to 6% compared to traditional SGD training without compromising test accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances sparsity, computational efficiency, and accuracy, making it suitable for efficient neural network training.

Abstract: We introduce a dynamic sparse training algorithm based on linearized Bregman iterations / mirror descent that exploits the naturally incurred sparsity by alternating between periods of static and dynamic sparsity pattern updates. The key idea is to combine sparsity-inducing Bregman iterations with adaptive freezing of the network structure to enable efficient exploration of the sparse parameter space while maintaining sparsity. We provide convergence guaranties by embedding our method in a multilevel optimization framework. Furthermore, we empirically show that our algorithm can produce highly sparse and accurate models on standard benchmarks. We also show that the theoretical number of FLOPs compared to SGD training can be reduced from 38% for standard Bregman iterations to 6% for our method while maintaining test accuracy.

TL;DR: MatGPTQ introduces a post-training quantization method for Matryoshka Quantization models, optimizing them for multiple precisions in one shot and improving memory and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of making Matryoshka Quantization more practical by removing reliance on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) and providing open-source tools and efficient kernels.

Method: MatGPTQ uses a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation to optimize models for multiple target precisions simultaneously, leveraging a small calibration dataset.

Result: The approach preserves accuracy at higher bit-widths while significantly improving performance at lower bit-widths across standard LLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MatGPTQ establishes a new state of the art in post-training quantization, enabling efficient multi-precision deployment with a single checkpoint and making it practical through open-source support and tools.

Abstract: Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, "sliceable" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the energy inefficiency of current digital hardware when applying machine learning and explore analog computing as a viable, energy-efficient alternative.

Method: The researchers propose a novel algorithm for exact gradient calculation using Kirchhoff's laws and graph theory. They introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a unified framework that includes Hebbian learning algorithms like Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation. They further validate their method through numerical simulations.

Result: The proposed algorithm enables training resistor networks efficiently without the need for replica or readout over all resistors. They demonstrate that selectively updating resistance values has minimal effects on performance.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising pathway to realizing energy-efficient analog computing systems for machine learning and highlights the versatility of using localized learning methods and selective updates for optimization.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving sepsis treatment by identifying clinically distinct phenotypes from the heterogeneous syndrome using clustering methods based on clinical relevance.

Method: Developed NPCNet, a deep clustering network with a target navigator, integrating temporal EHR data to classify sepsis patients into different phenotypes.

Result: NPCNet identified four sepsis phenotypes ($α$, $β$, $γ$, and $δ$) with distinct clinical patterns, including differentiation of patients likely to improve versus those at risk of deterioration.

Conclusion: NPCNet provides enhanced precision in treatment strategies for sepsis by uncovering meaningful and clinically significant phenotypes, aiding early treatment interventions like vasopressor administration.

Abstract: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identifying clinically distinct phenotypes may enable more precise treatment strategies. In recent years, many researchers have applied clustering algorithms to sepsis patients. However, the clustering process rarely incorporates clinical relevance, potentially limiting to reflect clinically distinct phenotypes. We propose NPCNet, a novel deep clustering network with a target navigator that integrates temporal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to better align sepsis phenotypes with clinical significance. We identify four sepsis phenotypes ($α$, $β$, $γ$, and $δ$) with divergence in SOFA trajectories. Notably, while $α$ and $δ$ phenotypes both show severe conditions in the early stage, NPCNet effectively differentiates patients who are likely to improve ($α$) from those at risk of deterioration ($δ$). Furthermore, through the treatment effect analysis, we discover that $α$, $β$, and $δ$ phenotypes may benefit from early vasopressor administration. The results show that NPCNet enhances precision treatment strategies by uncovering clinically distinct phenotypes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoGenCast, a hybrid method combining pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and flow-matching mechanisms for improved time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting requires understanding contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of temporal dynamics, limitations that existing methods (LLMs or diffusion models alone) fail to address adequately.

Method: CoGenCast reconfigures pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into an encoder-decoder structure with modified attention topology for context modeling and integrates flow-matching mechanisms to model temporal stochastic dynamics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CoGenCast consistently outperforms existing baselines in multiple benchmarks, achieving superior forecasting performance.

Conclusion: CoGenCast offers a hybrid framework that effectively bridges the gap between contextual semantic understanding and stochastic temporal modeling, enabling multimodal forecasting and cross-domain applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting can be viewed as a generative problem that requires both semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/liuyaguo/_CoGenCast.

*Weiqi Wang,Zhiyi Tian,Chenhan Zhang,Luoyu Chen,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EVE, a method that efficiently verifies machine unlearning using perturbations without requiring involvement in the model training phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning verification methods often rely on backdooring techniques and require participation during the model's training, which is impractical and inefficient.

Method: EVE employs perturbations designed via adversarial optimization to ensure that the model's predictions change after unlearning, providing verification through observation of prediction shifts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate EVE's superiority in verification accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, and it does not depend on the initial training phase.

Conclusion: EVE is an innovative and efficient method for verifying machine unlearning, optimizing both accuracy and speed, while eliminating the requirement for participation in the model's initial training; the source code is openly available.

Abstract: Verifying whether the machine unlearning process has been properly executed is critical but remains underexplored. Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy. The source code of EVE is released at \uline{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVE-C143}, providing a novel tool for verification of machine unlearning.

### [487] [Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring for Audio-Visual Joint Representation: Resolving Information Allocation Ambiguity for Robust Cross-Modal Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03570)
*Bixing Wu,Yuhong Zhao,Zongli Ye,Jiachen Lian,Xiangyu Yue,Gopala Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), a framework that improves cross-modal generalization by addressing semantic-specific leakage and enhancing representational consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to overcome the issue of semantic-specific leakage across modalities in cross-modal generalization tasks, which arises due to the absence of structural biases in existing symmetric frameworks.

Method: Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA) employs directional information allocation using structured semantic hierarchy from audio RVQ, adversarial decoupling using GRL to prevent semantic leakage, and Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) for fine-grained temporal alignment.

Result: Experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks show that AHA surpasses symmetric baseline methods in cross-modal transfer tasks, with additional validation in talking-face disentanglement tasks highlighting its improved consistency and disentanglement.

Conclusion: AHA outperforms existing cross-modal frameworks and introduces a robust approach for improving semantic consistency and generalization across audio-visual modalities.

Abstract: Audio-visual joint representation learning under Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source modality to an unlabeled target modality through a unified discrete representation space. Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.

*Huaguan Chen,Ning Lin,Luxi Chen,Rui Zhang,Wenbing Huang,Chongxuan Li,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach for aerodynamic inverse design by improving cost predictors and guided generation methods, validated with simulations and physical prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coupling high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations in inverse design problems like aerodynamic optimization.

Method: The authors propose a new training loss for cost predictors, a density-gradient optimization method, and a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation.

Result: Demonstrates consistent achievements in both optimization and guided generation in aerodynamic benchmarks, validated through simulations, experiments, and offline RL support.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance inverse design tasks while maintaining shape plausibility and efficiency, showing generality across various aerodynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Inverse design with physics-based objectives is challenging because it couples high-dimensional geometry with expensive simulations, as exemplified by aerodynamic shape optimization for drag reduction. We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation. Additional offline RL results further support the generality of our approach.

### [489] [APEX: Probing Neural Networks via Activation Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03586)
*Tao Ren,Xiaoyu Luo,Qiongxiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes APEX (Activation Perturbation for EXploration), a methodology for probing neural networks using perturbations in hidden activations, surpassing limitations of traditional input-space and parameter perturbation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to access structural information encoded in the intermediate representations of neural networks, which traditional methods fail to sufficiently uncover.

Method: APEX perturbs neural network hidden activations at inference time without altering inputs or model parameters. It theoretically transitions neural behavior from being sample-dependent to model-dependent.

Result: APEX is demonstrated to measure sample regularity, distinguish structured versus randomly labeled models, and reveal semantic prediction transitions in low-noise settings. In high-noise scenarios, it exposes model biases, such as backdoor-related class prediction concentration.

Conclusion: APEX enables novel insights into neural network behaviors by leveraging activation perturbation, offering a more effective alternative to input-space probing methods.

Abstract: Prior work on probing neural networks primarily relies on input-space analysis or parameter perturbation, both of which face fundamental limitations in accessing structural information encoded in intermediate representations. We introduce Activation Perturbation for EXploration (APEX), an inference-time probing paradigm that perturbs hidden activations while keeping both inputs and model parameters fixed. We theoretically show that activation perturbation induces a principled transition from sample-dependent to model-dependent behavior by suppressing input-specific signals and amplifying representation-level structure, and further establish that input perturbation corresponds to a constrained special case of this framework. Through representative case studies, we demonstrate the practical advantages of APEX. In the small-noise regime, APEX provides a lightweight and efficient measure of sample regularity that aligns with established metrics, while also distinguishing structured from randomly labeled models and revealing semantically coherent prediction transitions. In the large-noise regime, APEX exposes training-induced model-level biases, including a pronounced concentration of predictions on the target class in backdoored models. Overall, our results show that APEX offers an effective perspective for exploring, and understanding neural networks beyond what is accessible from input space alone.

### [490] [SAGE-5GC: Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating Anomaly Detection in the 5G Core Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03596)
*Cristian Manca,Christian Scano,Giorgio Piras,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the shortcomings of anomaly detection systems in 5G Core networks by proposing guidelines for realistic and adversarial evaluation, revealing the vulnerabilities of current detection models to crafted attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the unrealistic assumptions in evaluating existing anomaly detection systems, such as assuming IID data availability and no adversarial presence, which rarely reflect real-world 5G Core network conditions.

Method: The authors proposed SAGE-5GC (Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors) using domain knowledge and adversarial threat considerations. They assessed anomaly detectors in standard and adversarial scenarios, leveraging randomized perturbations and genetic algorithms to simulate realistic adversarial attacks.

Result: The results demonstrated that adversarially crafted attacks could severely impair the performance of 5G anomaly detectors. The proposed adversarial evaluations highlighted the vulnerabilities and the necessity for robust evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current anomaly detection systems require improved robustness against adversarial attacks. The introduced SAGE-5GC guidelines can help in designing and assessing anomaly detectors in realistic 5G network environments.

Abstract: Machine learning-based anomaly detection systems are increasingly being adopted in 5G Core networks to monitor complex, high-volume traffic. However, most existing approaches are evaluated under strong assumptions that rarely hold in operational environments, notably the availability of independent and identically distributed (IID) data and the absence of adaptive attackers.In this work, we study the problem of detecting 5G attacks \textit{in the wild}, focusing on realistic deployment settings. We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild.

*Fatima Ezzeddine,Osama Zammar,Silvia Giordano,Omran Ayoub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how counterfactual explanations in Machine Learning as a Service systems increase vulnerability to privacy attacks like membership inference and proposes defenses involving differential privacy and active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how counterfactual explanations in MLaaS systems impact privacy vulnerabilities and to design mechanisms that mitigate emerging risks without reducing the utility and explainability of these systems.

Method: Analyzing the connection between counterfactual explanations and strengthened membership inference attacks, followed by proposing a framework combining Differential Privacy and Active Learning to address the issue.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluation revealed a trade-off among privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality, emphasizing the complexity of balancing these factors.

Conclusion: Explainable MLaaS systems must strategically balance transparency, utility, and privacy to ensure responsible deployment.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) are increasingly integrated into Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems to improve transparency; however, ML models deployed via APIs are already vulnerable to privacy attacks such as membership inference and model extraction, and the impact of explanations on this threat landscape remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems.

*Dario Malchiodi,Mattia Ferraretto,Marco Frasca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to weight quantization by integrating quantization-awareness directly into the training process, reducing accuracy loss and achieving effective compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Neural Networks, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, struggle with deployment on resource-limited devices due to their large size and over-parameterization, necessitating model compression with minimal accuracy loss.

Method: The approach uses per-layer regularization terms to naturally cluster weights during training, embedding quantization parameters into the backpropagation process to align parameter space exploration with compression goals.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 demonstrate the proposed method effectively reduces the accuracy drop and maintains compression potential.

Conclusion: Integrating quantization during training offers a promising way to minimize accuracy compromise in weight quantization, marking a significant advancement in model compression techniques.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks reached state-of-the-art performance across numerous domains, but this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large and over-parameterized models, posing serious challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a result, model compression has become essential, and -- among compression techniques -- weight quantization is largely used and particularly effective, yet it typically introduces a non-negligible accuracy drop. However, it is usually applied to already trained models, without influencing how the parameter space is explored during the learning phase. In contrast, we introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This reduces the accuracy loss typically associated with quantization methods while preserving their compression potential. Furthermore, in our framework quantization representatives become network parameters, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to embed quantization parameters directly into the backpropagation procedure. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 models confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

*Cindy Xiangrui Kong,Yueqi Wang,Haoyang Zheng,Weijian Luo,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Phys-Instruct, a framework to improve diffusion-based PDE solvers by making them faster and more physics-consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high sampling cost and limited physical consistency in diffusion-based PDE solvers motivate the need for a faster and more accurate approach.

Method: Phys-Instruct employs a physics-guided distillation framework to compress diffusion PDE solvers into few-step generators while introducing PDE knowledge through explicit distillation guidance.

Result: Phys-Instruct achieves significantly faster inference and reduces PDE errors by over 8 times, outperforming existing diffusion-based solvers.

Conclusion: Phys-Instruct demonstrates its potential as a fast, effective, and physically consistent PDE solving framework using deep generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have demonstrated impressive accuracy and generalization in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Moreover, the resulting unconditional student model functions as a compact prior, enabling efficient and physically consistent inference for various downstream conditional tasks. Our results indicate that Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models.

*Milosh Devic,Jordan Gierschendorf,David Garson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTTVAE+TBS, a generative framework for generating tabular data under class imbalance, achieving strong minority class performance in multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating synthetic tabular data that is representative of minority classes, especially in domains like healthcare and fraud detection.

Method: CTTVAE+TBS integrates a Conditional Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder, class-aware triplet margin loss for structured latent space, and targeted sampling to favor underrepresented classes.

Result: CTTVAE+TBS outperforms other methods on downstream tasks for minority classes and competes with state-of-the-art models in maintaining data fidelity.

Conclusion: CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust, interpretable solution for generating tabular data prioritizing rare categories, with proven benefits in real-world applications.

Abstract: Generating synthetic tabular data under severe class imbalance is essential for domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making. However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical.

*Yicheng Zhang,Zhen Qin,Zhaomin Wu,Wenqi Zhang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper optimizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines by addressing limitations in retriever optimization, employing reinforcement learning (RL), and introducing advanced retrieval techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retriever optimization methods in RAG pipelines face objective mismatches, and the challenges of applying RL to optimize retrievers need resolution.

Method: The authors replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling, reframe RAG as a Markov decision process, and integrate retrieval history at each step to improve retriever optimization using RL.

Result: Experiments on various RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales show consistent performance improvements from the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based approach effectively enhances RAG performance by addressing key challenges in retriever optimization and advancing the state of evidence-based response generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance.

*Giovanni Luca Marchetti,Daniel Kunin,Adele Myers,Francisco Acosta,Nina Miolane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how neural networks perform structured operations using the sequential group composition task, focusing on factors like group structure, encoding, and sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how neural networks acquire the ability to perform computational tasks, such as arithmetic and algorithms, through the lens of a tractable structured task.

Method: The paper introduces the sequential group composition task, where networks predict cumulative products of elements from a finite group, which requires nonlinear architectures to solve. It also uses theoretical analysis and compares various network architectures.

Result: Two-layer networks learn representations based on Fourier statistics but require hidden widths exponential in sequence length. Recurrent and deeper networks leverage the task's associativity, achieving improved scaling with fewer steps or layers.

Conclusion: The sequential group composition task provides insights into deep learning mechanics, and deeper models are more efficient at solving such structured computation tasks.

Abstract: How do neural networks trained over sequences acquire the ability to perform structured operations, such as arithmetic, geometric, and algorithmic computation? To gain insight into this question, we introduce the sequential group composition task. In this task, networks receive a sequence of elements from a finite group encoded in a real vector space and must predict their cumulative product. The task can be order-sensitive and requires a nonlinear architecture to be learned. Our analysis isolates the roles of the group structure, encoding statistics, and sequence length in shaping learning. We prove that two-layer networks learn this task one irreducible representation of the group at a time in an order determined by the Fourier statistics of the encoding. These networks can perfectly learn the task, but doing so requires a hidden width exponential in the sequence length $k$. In contrast, we show how deeper models exploit the associativity of the task to dramatically improve this scaling: recurrent neural networks compose elements sequentially in $k$ steps, while multilayer networks compose adjacent pairs in parallel in $\log k$ layers. Overall, the sequential group composition task offers a tractable window into the mechanics of deep learning.

*Simon Dietz,Kai Klede,An Nguyen,Bjoern M Eskofier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ContraLog is a self-supervised, parser-free method for log anomaly detection using continuous message embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for log anomaly detection rely heavily on log parsers, which simplify log messages into templates but lose essential information, motivating the need for a parser-free approach.

Method: ContraLog employs a message encoder to create rich embeddings for individual log messages, a sequence encoder for temporal modeling, and combines masked language modeling with contrastive learning for self-supervised training.

Result: Experiments on datasets like HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird demonstrate that ContraLog effectively detects anomalies and its embeddings are meaningful even without sequence context.

Conclusion: Embedding-level prediction offers a promising approach for log anomaly detection, benefiting from rich semantic information without relying on parsers.

Abstract: Log files record computational events that reflect system state and behavior, making them a primary source of operational insights in modern computer systems. Automated anomaly detection on logs is therefore critical, yet most established methods rely on log parsers that collapse messages into discrete templates, discarding variable values and semantic content. We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences.

*Mattia Sabella,Alberto Archetti,Pietro Pinoli,Matteo Matteucci,Cinzia Cappiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuAIL is a training mechanism for tabular ML that uses feature reliability information to improve robustness against data corruption, without explicit data cleaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of tabular data often having non-uniform corruption (e.g., noise, missing entries) and limited feature reliability information, which limits standard robustness techniques.

Method: The proposed QuAIL method integrates feature-specific reliability priors into a model via a learnable feature-modulation layer, constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer.

Result: QuAIL was tested on 50 datasets and showed consistent performance improvements over neural baselines under various corruption types, excelling in low-data and biased scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating feature reliability into optimization is an effective way to enhance robustness in tabular machine learning, especially when faced with structured data corruption.

Abstract: Tabular machine learning systems are frequently trained on data affected by non-uniform corruption, including noisy measurements, missing entries, and feature-specific biases. In practice, these defects are often documented only through column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting the applicability of many robustness and cleaning techniques. We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning.

*Zishi Zhang,Jinhui Han,Ming Hu,Yijie Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses small-data, large-scale decision problems by leveraging a pretrain-then-finetune approach using a designed Transformer model, enabling effective decision-making in noisy and limited data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve large-scale decision-making challenges where a firm has limited and potentially noisy data for each instance but needs to make many operational decisions simultaneously.

Method: A pretrain-then-finetune pipeline is proposed, where a Transformer model is pretrained on synthetic data incorporating domain knowledge, followed by fine-tuning on real observations to adapt to the operational environment.

Result: The approach uses tailored architecture and training methods to ensure effectiveness, supported by theoretical error analysis that validates the joint impact of pretraining and fine-tuning in performance enhancement. It also identifies economies-of-scale effects in fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully integrates domain knowledge with machine learning, demonstrating the utility of pretraining and fine-tuning in improving decision-making capabilities even with limited noisy data.

Abstract: We consider small-data, large-scale decision problems in which a firm must make many operational decisions simultaneously (e.g., across a large product portfolio) while observing only a few, potentially noisy, data points per instance. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.

*Dylan Sandfelder,Mihai Cucuringu,Xiaowen Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a scalable framework for graph filtering using interpretable spectral kernels modulated by Gaussian factors, and explores its transferability across graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph filtering methods by designing a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable framework that can adapt to heterogeneous graph signal regimes.

Method: Developed Adaptive Spectral Shaping using modular spectral kernels and Gaussian factors, implemented with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, and introduced Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS) for transferable learning across graphs.

Result: Adaptive Spectral Shaping outperforms conventional methods in reconstruction error reduction, while TASS demonstrates consistent positive transfer across graphs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a versatile solution to graph signal processing, achieving a balance of scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Spectral Shaping, a data-driven framework for graph filtering that learns a reusable baseline spectral kernel and modulates it with a small set of Gaussian factors. The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling efficiently from the Boltzmann distribution is challenging due to costly simulation data and energy evaluations, necessitating improved training methods.

Method: The authors propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), which uses regularization techniques based on log-variance objectives in combination with standard data-driven approaches, without requiring additional samples.

Result: LDR achieves enhanced data efficiency, including up to one order of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The LDR framework broadly enhances performance and efficiency in sampling tasks, making it applicable to various simulation datasets and settings.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized probability densities is a central challenge in computational science. Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.

*Themistoklis Haris,Steve Choi,Mutiraj Laksanawisit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an optimized approach to the Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM), reducing its runtime from Θ(m) to Θ(√m) using lazy sampling and efficient data structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability bottleneck of the MWEM framework caused by its Θ(m) per-iteration time complexity, making it inefficient for large-scale private data analysis tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a lazy sampling modification using Gumbel noise and a k-Nearest Neighbor data structure to approximate selections in the exponential mechanism without exhaustive computation.

Result: The proposed approach improves runtime expectations to Θ(√m) and demonstrates enhanced computational efficiency and scalability in private linear query release and Linear Program solving applications.

Conclusion: The accelerated framework succeeds in significantly optimizing MWEM's runtime, making it more scalable while maintaining its effectiveness for private data tasks.

Abstract: The Multiplicative Weights Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) is a fundamental iterative framework for private data analysis, with broad applications such as answering $m$ linear queries, or privately solving systems of $m$ linear constraints. However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $Θ(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions. Experimental evaluation confirms that our method provides a substantial runtime improvement over classic MWEM.

*Rajat Masiwal,Colin Aitken,Adam Marchakitus,Mayank Gupta,Katherine Kowal,Hamid A. Pahlavan,Tyler Yang,Y. Qiang Sun,Michael Kremer,Amir Jina,William R. Boos,Pedram Hassanzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework integrating meteorology, AI, and social sciences to optimize AI-based weather prediction, focusing on Indian monsoon forecasting for agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to help vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income regions make better decisions against weather shocks using efficient AIWP models, which outperform traditional methods but currently lack stakeholder-focused validation.

Method: The paper develops a new framework that combines meteorology, AI, and social sciences to benchmark AIWP models based on real-world, decision-oriented operational needs.

Result: The framework demonstrated the ability of AIWP models to predict agriculturally relevant metrics, such as monsoon onset, weeks in advance, influencing a government-led initiative to deliver forecasts to 38 million Indian farmers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the application of AIWP models to support vulnerable populations in adapting to climate-induced weather shocks, especially benefiting rain-fed agriculture reliant on accurate forecasts.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change.

### [505] [Reasoning with Latent Tokens in Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03769)
*Andre He,Sean Welleck,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the trade-off between inference speed and performance in discrete diffusion models for language modeling, emphasizing the role of latent tokens in improving reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of autoregressive models on reasoning tasks requiring global coherence and explore how latent tokens, prominent in diffusion models, enhance language modeling and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study analyzes the effect of predicting a distribution over all tokens, introduces modulating latent tokens to balance speed and quality, and applies a multi-token prediction objective to autoregressive models to improve reasoning tasks.

Result: Empirical experiments show that modulating latent tokens allows a smooth trade-off between inference speed and quality in diffusion models. Additionally, incorporating latent tokens in autoregressive models significantly improves reasoning task performance.

Conclusion: Latent tokens, naturally arising in diffusion models, serve as a general mechanism to improve reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, and this mechanism can also benefit autoregressive models.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently become competitive with autoregressive models for language modeling, even outperforming them on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, but they require more computation at inference time. We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead.

*Changhao Wang,Yunfei Yu,Xinhao Yao,Jiaolong Yang,Riccardo Cantoro,Chaobo Li,Qing Cui,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniGeM, a framework that improves large language model training with better data quality strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in data quality for scaling large language models, which is not efficiently handled by current methods that separate data mixing and sample selection.

Method: UniGeM uses a unified approach treating data curation as a manifold approximation problem, employing Macro-Exploration for mixing weights and Micro-Mining for high-quality filtering.

Result: The framework achieved a 2x data efficiency increase compared to random baselines, and outperformed state-of-the-art methods in certain evaluations.

Conclusion: UniGeM effectively enhances data efficiency and performance in LLM training by unifying data mixing and selection processes.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly limited by data quality. Most methods handle data mixing and sample selection separately, which can break the structure in code corpora. We introduce \textbf{UniGeM}, a framework that unifies mixing and selection by treating data curation as a \textit{manifold approximation} problem without training proxy models or relying on external reference datasets. UniGeM operates hierarchically: \textbf{Macro-Exploration} learns mixing weights with stability-based clustering; \textbf{Micro-Mining} filters high-quality instances by their geometric distribution to ensure logical consistency. Validated by training 8B and 16B MoE models on 100B tokens, UniGeM achieves \textbf{2.0$\times$ data efficiency} over a random baseline and further improves overall performance compared to SOTA methods in reasoning-heavy evaluations and multilingual generalization.

*Ian Wu,Yuxiao Qu,Amrith Setlur,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that helps LLMs improve and adapt beyond their training data during test time, enhancing their reasoning capabilities significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable large language models (LLMs) to solve increasingly complex problems by improving performance through test-time adaptations and overcoming limitations posed by fixed problem distributions in standard reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose RC (Reasoning Chain), an iterative decoding method that leverages the asymmetry between LLMs' abilities in response generation and summarization to improve reasoning through multiple iterations during training and inference.

Result: Training a 4B parameter model with RC improves reasoning performance on the HMMT 2025 benchmark from 40% to nearly 70% while reducing dependence on larger model sizes and scaling better under test-time conditions.

Conclusion: RC allows LLMs to extrapolate effectively, continually improve reasoning, and leverage external scaffolds at test-time, marking a step forward in adaptive test-time learning and longer reasoning horizons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can continually improve beyond their training budgets are able to solve increasingly difficult problems by adapting at test time, a property we refer to as extrapolation. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.

### [508] [Reward Redistribution for CVaR MDPs using a Bellman Operator on L-infinity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03778)
*Aneri Muni,Vincent Taboga,Esther Derman,Pierre-Luc Bacon,Erick Delage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenge of handling tail-end risks with CVaR in Markov decision processes by proposing a new augmentation formulation that avoids sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points while ensuring convergence and performance trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tail-end risks, such as catastrophic events, pose significant challenges in safety-critical applications. Existing algorithms for static CVaR, relying on state augmentation, suffer from sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces a novel formulation for the static CVaR objective using augmented states, leading to a new Bellman operator that ensures dense rewards and contracting properties. It develops risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms under this framework.

Result: The proposed algorithms exhibit convergence and reduced approximation errors due to discretization. Empirical results validate the ability to learn CVaR-sensitive policies that balance performance and safety effectively.

Conclusion: The study presents improved methods for managing tail-end risks in Markov decision processes, successfully addressing key issues in current approaches and offering practical solutions for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Tail-end risk measures such as static conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used in safety-critical applications to prevent rare, yet catastrophic events. Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs.

*Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury,Rahul Kidambi,Avinava Dubey,David Wang,Gokhan Mergen,Amr Ahmed,Aranyak Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on inference-time unlearning for generative models, introducing a method to guarantee unlearning without modifying model parameters, significantly outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods degrade general-purpose capabilities of pre-trained models and face issues in real-world applications, especially for generative models.

Method: The paper proposes inference-time unlearning with a verifier that ensures unlearning guarantees through iterative response refinement, using conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead.

Result: The proposed framework reduces unlearning error by up to 93% across unlearning benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Inference-time unlearning can achieve efficient and reliable unlearning without retraining or modifying model parameters, making it applicable to generative models while retaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing specific information from a trained machine learning model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks.

*Bogdan Kulynych,Theresa Stadler,Jean Louis Raisaro,Carmela Troncoso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three main uses of synthetic data—privacy-preserving sharing, training augmentation, and variance reduction—by identifying fundamental and practical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to critically assess high expectations placed on synthetic data to solve challenges related to data access, scarcity, and representation.

Method: Authors formalize three key use cases and analyze their feasibility through formal analysis and case studies, identifying constraints and conditions under which synthetic data can achieve desired outcomes.

Result: The study highlights that many envisioned applications of synthetic data face constraints and are not well-suited for the problems they aim to address.

Conclusion: The classification and analysis offer decision-makers tools to evaluate the appropriateness of synthetic data for specific challenges, cautioning against over-reliance on it for unsuitable problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modelling have led many to see synthetic data as the go-to solution for a range of problems around data access, scarcity, and under-representation. In this paper, we study three prominent use cases: (1) Sharing synthetic data as a proxy for proprietary datasets to enable statistical analyses while protecting privacy, (2) Augmenting machine learning training sets with synthetic data to improve model performance, and (3) Augmenting datasets with synthetic data to reduce variance in statistical estimation. For each use case, we formalise the problem setting and study, through formal analysis and case studies, under which conditions synthetic data can achieve its intended objectives. We identify fundamental and practical limits that constrain when synthetic data can serve as an effective solution for a particular problem. Our analysis reveals that due to these limits many existing or envisioned use cases of synthetic data are a poor problem fit. Our formalisations and classification of synthetic data use cases enable decision makers to assess whether synthetic data is a suitable approach for their specific data availability problem.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Manifold Random Features (MRFs) for approximating bi-variate functions and kernels on manifolds using a discrete-to-continuous approach leveraging Graph Random Features (GRFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to develop a theoretically sound, accurate mechanism for approximating functions on general manifolds, which can often lack analytical solutions.

Method: The method involves discretizing the manifold, using Graph Random Features to model fields on those manifolds, resulting in continuous, positive features for approximation.

Result: The authors establish a theoretical connection between GRFs and traditional random features and successfully re-discover a simplified computation method for Gaussian kernel approximation with applications in linear-attention Transformers.

Conclusion: Manifold Random Features present a robust and low-variance solution for function approximation on manifolds, theoretically backed and experimentally validated, offering insights into both graph-based and kernel-based approaches.

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for creating random features to approximate bi-variate functions (in particular, kernels) defined on general manifolds. This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approximation mechanisms that otherwise, in general scenarios, cannot be derived analytically. MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies.

*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of machine learning (ML) models to improve critical heat flux (CHF) predictions in rod bundle geometries, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the prediction accuracy of critical heat flux (CHF) in full-scale reactor core simulations using machine learning methods, as current approaches like empirical correlations and lookup tables are less accurate.

Method: The study implemented purely data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs) and hybrid bias-correction ML models into the CTF subchannel code to predict CHF in rod bundles, using tube-based CHF data for training and testing performance against conventional models.

Result: ML-based approaches outperformed the baseline models (W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, Groeneveld LUT) in predicting CHF location and magnitude, with the hybrid LUT model showing the best performance metrics.

Conclusion: ML models are effective in improving CHF predictions for rod bundles, indicating their potential for reactor core simulation enhancements.

Abstract: The prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a highly active research activity in recent years, the goal of which is to build models more accurate than current conventional approaches such as empirical correlations or lookup tables (LUTs). Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL3AN-GNN, a learning network that uses a curriculum-guided multi-stage attention system to improve imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of imbalanced node classification in GNNs, where disproportionately represented labels lead to poor model fairness and performance on minority classes.

Method: The authors devised CL3AN-GNN, a method that incorporates: (1) a three-stage attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed), mimicking how humans learn, (2) curriculum-guided feature learning starting from simpler patterns to complex ones, and (3) iterative message passing and loss weighting.

Result: Experiments on eight diverse datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements in metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over state-of-the-art techniques, supporting the model’s applicability for varied graph data.

Conclusion: CL3AN-GNN offers a theoretically sound curriculum learning approach for GNNs, effectively handling imbalanced classifications with faster convergence, better generalization, and precise interpretability.

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.

TL;DR: SymPlex is a reinforcement learning framework for discovering symbolic solutions to PDEs without requiring ground-truth expressions, using hierarchical modeling and grammar-constrained decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deriving interpretable, human-readable symbolic solutions to PDEs, which traditional numerical or neural methods fail to achieve effectively.

Method: The framework reformulates PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and introduces SymFormer, a Transformer-based model with tree-relative self-attention and grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding.

Result: Empirical evaluations reveal that SymPlex can recover exact symbolic solutions for non-smooth and parametric PDEs, demonstrating its effectiveness and interpretability.

Conclusion: SymPlex provides a novel approach for solving PDEs symbolically, enhancing interpretability and handling non-smooth behaviors while overcoming limitations of numerical approximation and neural methods.

Abstract: We propose SymPlex, a reinforcement learning framework for discovering analytical symbolic solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) without access to ground-truth expressions. SymPlex formulates symbolic PDE solving as tree-structured decision-making and optimizes candidate solutions using only the PDE and its boundary conditions. At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) and proposes Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT) to learn from noisy intervention data while leveraging prior policy to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve autonomous systems' ability to learn reliably from human intervention signals, which are noisy and incomplete, and necessary for enhancing performance during testing.

Method: RIFT uses a residual fine-tuning approach that blends intervention feedback with a prior policy to address ambiguity and under-specification in human intervention signals.

Result: Theoretical analysis finds conditions for effective policy improvement with RIFT, while experiments show its consistent improvement across varying policies and intervention strategies.

Conclusion: Residual fine-tuning enhances robust policy learning from interventions, highlighting the potential of intervention-based learning in robust autonomous systems.

Abstract: Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work.

*Erfan Miahi,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies and leverages weight-update sparsity in reinforcement learning (RL) to propose an efficient method for policy weight synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bandwidth bottleneck in distributed RL synchronization over constrained networks or decentralized settings.

Method: Conducts a study on step-level and multi-step weight-update sparsity to develop PULSE, a method transmitting only modified indices and values for efficient parameter updates.

Result: PULSE achieves over 100x communication reduction while maintaining performance and bit-identical dynamics, reducing bandwidth from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s.

Conclusion: PULSE enables decentralized RL to achieve near-centralized throughput by effectively reducing synchronization bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component for post-training large language models (LLMs). However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.

*Romain Cosentino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors present PLATE, a continual learning method for pretrained models that doesn't require access to old-task data. It exploits redundancy in pretrained networks to optimize plasticity while retaining past knowledge, offering a structured low-rank update approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in adapting foundation models where pretraining distributions are often unavailable, making continual learning feasible without old-task data.

Method: Developed PLATE, which leverages geometric redundancy in pretrained networks to construct update subspaces from redundant neurons and parameterizes layers using structured low-rank updates ($ΔW = B A Q^\top$).

Result: PLATE achieves efficient continual learning, providing explicit control of plasticity-retention trade-offs, reducing functional drift, and improving knowledge retention guarantees.

Conclusion: PLATE represents a practical solution for continual learning in pretrained models. By leveraging redundancy, it facilitates adaptation to new tasks without reliance on old-task data.

Abstract: We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees. These insights lead to \textsc{PLATE} (\textbf{Pla}sticity-\textbf{T}unable \textbf{E}fficient Adapters), a continual learning method requiring no past-task data that provides explicit control over the plasticity-retention trade-off. PLATE parameterizes each layer with a structured low-rank update $ΔW = B A Q^\top$, where $B$ and $Q$ are computed once from pretrained weights and kept frozen, and only $A$ is trained on the new task.

*Sangjun Park,Elliot Meyerson,Xin Qiu,Risto Miikkulainen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores the metacognitive abilities of LLMs and introduces a framework with Evolution Strategy for aligning internal knowledge with explicit behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) utilize their internal memory for metacognition.

Method: Introduces a dual-prompt method to measure metacognitive ability ($d_{\rm{type2}}'$) and ESMA for aligning internal knowledge to explicit behaviors.

Result: ESMA exhibited strong generalization across diverse untrained settings and improved metacognitive referencing abilities.

Conclusion: Sparse parameter modifications through ESMA resulted in notable improvements in aligning LLMs' explicit behaviors with their internal knowledge.

Abstract: Metacognition is a critical component of intelligence, specifically regarding the awareness of one's own knowledge. While humans rely on shared internal memory for both answering questions and reporting their knowledge state, this dependency in LLMs remains underexplored. This study proposes a framework to measure metacognitive ability $d_{\rm{type2}}'$ using a dual-prompt method, followed by the introduction of Evolution Strategy for Metacognitive Alignment (ESMA) to bind a model's internal knowledge to its explicit behaviors. ESMA demonstrates robust generalization across diverse untrained settings, indicating a enhancement in the model's ability to reference its own knowledge. Furthermore, parameter analysis attributes these improvements to a sparse set of significant modifications.

*Wojciech Achtelik,Hubert Guzowski,Maciej Smołka,Jacek Mańdziuk*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Evolution of Test Functions (EoTF), a framework for automatically generating benchmark functions that match desired exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of widely used benchmark suites like BBOB and CEC, which rely on hand-crafted functions and lack diversity in representing real-world problem landscapes.

Method: Adapts LLM-driven evolutionary search to generate interpretable numpy implementations of objective functions. These generated functions aim to match a target ELA feature vector.

Result: EoTF reliably generates non-trivial functions with matching ELA characteristics and preserves optimizer performance rankings. Its scalability outperforms a baseline neural network generator in 3D and higher dimensions.

Conclusion: EoTF provides a scalable, interpretable, and effective method for generating benchmark test functions tailored to specific landscape properties, improving evaluation and training of meta-black-box optimizers.

Abstract: The development of black-box optimization algorithms depends on the availability of benchmark suites that are both diverse and representative of real-world problem landscapes. Widely used collections such as BBOB and CEC remain dominated by hand-crafted synthetic functions and provide limited coverage of the high-dimensional space of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) features, which in turn biases evaluation and hinders training of meta-black-box optimizers. We introduce Evolution of Test Functions (EoTF), a framework that automatically generates continuous optimization test functions whose landscapes match a specified target ELA feature vector. EoTF adapts LLM-driven evolutionary search, originally proposed for heuristic discovery, to evolve interpretable, self-contained numpy implementations of objective functions by minimizing the distance between sampled ELA features of generated candidates and a target profile. In experiments on 24 noiseless BBOB functions and a contamination-mitigating suite of 24 MA-BBOB hybrid functions, EoTF reliably produces non-trivial functions with closely matching ELA characteristics and preserves optimizer performance rankings under fixed evaluation budgets, supporting their validity as surrogate benchmarks. While a baseline neural-network-based generator achieves higher accuracy in 2D, EoTF substantially outperforms it in 3D and exhibits stable solution quality as dimensionality increases, highlighting favorable scalability. Overall, EoTF offers a practical route to scalable, portable, and interpretable benchmark generation targeted to desired landscape properties.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EXAQC, an evolutionary algorithm to automatically design and train parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), achieving high performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional quantum circuit design approaches, which lack scalability, flexibility, and problem and hardware adaptability.

Method: EXAQC employs an evolutionary search technique inspired by neuroevolution and genetic programming to optimize gate types, connectivity, parameterization, and depth, while considering hardware constraints. It supports Qiskit and Pennylane libraries for customizable configurations.

Result: Preliminary results show over 90% accuracy on benchmark classification tasks and high fidelity in emulating target quantum states with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: EXAQC demonstrates the potential of evolutionary algorithms for scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design, advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Designing effective quantum circuits remains a central challenge in quantum computing, as circuit structure strongly influences expressivity, trainability, and hardware feasibility. Current approaches, whether using manually designed circuit templates, fixed heuristics, or automated rules, face limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability, often producing circuits that are poorly matched to the specific problem or quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), an evolutionary approach to the automated design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) which leverages and extends on strategies from neuroevolution and genetic programming. The proposed method jointly searches over gate types, qubit connectivity, parameterization, and circuit depth while respecting hardware and noise constraints. The method supports both Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, allowing the user to configure every aspect. This work highlights evolutionary search as a critical tool for advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms, providing a principled pathway toward scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design. Preliminary results demonstrate that circuits evolved on classification tasks are able to achieve over 90% accuracy on most of the benchmark datasets with a limited computational budget, and are able to emulate target circuit quantum states with high fidelity scores.

*Haoxuan Yin,Andrzej S. Murawski,C. -H. Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LMML, a metaprogramming language with strong type safety guarantees for open code, using a semantic model based on game semantics to prove program equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of ensuring type safety in metaprogramming languages with higher-order references and maintaining program equivalence during program optimizations.

Method: Layered Modal ML (LMML) employs contextual modal types to manage free variables in code and uses operational game semantics to model program equivalence.

Result: LMML ensures type safety for open code and provides a fully abstract semantic model to capture program equivalence, addressing both call-by-value and call-by-name substitutions.

Conclusion: The language LMML is a groundbreaking step in metaprogramming, ensuring safe and semantically equivalent optimizations through robust type-safety and semantic modeling techniques.

Abstract: MetaML-style metaprogramming languages allow programmers to construct, manipulate and run code. In the presence of higher-order references for code, ensuring type safety is challenging, as free variables can escape their binders. In this paper, we present Layered Modal ML (LMML), \textit{the first metaprogramming language that supports storing and running open code under a strong type safety guarantee}. The type system utilises contextual modal types to track and reason about free variables in code explicitly.
  A crucial concern in metaprogramming-based program optimisations is whether the optimised program preserves the meaning of the original program. Addressing this question requires a notion of program equivalence and techniques to reason about it. In this paper, we provide a semantic model that captures contextual equivalence for LMML, establishing \textit{the first full abstraction result for an imperative MetaML-style language}. Our model is based on traces derived via operational game semantics, where the meaning of a program is modelled by its possible interactions with the environment. We also establish a novel closed instances of use theorem that accounts for both call-by-value and call-by-name closing substitutions.

### [523] [From Separate Compilation to Sound Language Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03777)
*Federico Bruzzone,Walter Cazzola,Luca Favalli*

TL;DR: This paper introduces nlgcheck, a static analysis tool for the Neverlang language workbench to ensure compile-time correctness, preserving modularity, reusability, and performance under separate compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of modularity, reusability, and separate compilation in programming languages, focusing on runtime errors caused by invalidated attributes in attribute grammars within the Neverlang language workbench.

Method: Developed nlgcheck, a static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis, which identifies potential runtime errors, particularly undefined attribute accesses, at compile time.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed improvement in robustness, preventing runtime errors while maintaining modular development and acceptable performance for daily usage.

Conclusion: nlgcheck enhances the reliability of modular language extensions in Neverlang, ensuring correctness without compromising flexibility or separate compilation performance.

Abstract: The development of programming languages involves complex theoretical and practical challenges, particularly when addressing modularity and reusability through language extensions. While language workbenches aim to enable modular development under the constraints of the language extension problem, one critical constraint -- separate compilation -- is often relaxed due to its complexity. However, this relaxation undermines artifact reusability and integration with common dependency systems. A key difficulty under separate compilation arises from managing attribute grammars, as extensions may introduce new attributes that invalidate previously generated abstract syntax tree structures. Existing approaches, such as the use of dynamic maps in the Neverlang workbench, favor flexibility at the cost of compile-time correctness, leading to potential runtime errors due to undefined attributes. This work addresses this issue by introducing nlgcheck, a theoretically sound static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis for the Neverlang language workbench. nlgcheck detects potential runtime errors -- such as undefined attribute accesses -- at compile time, preserving separate compilation while maintaining strong static correctness guarantees. Experimental evaluation using mutation testing on Neverlang-based projects demonstrates that nlgcheck effectively enhances robustness without sacrificing modularity or flexibility and with a level of performance that does not impede its adoption in daily development activities.

*Kun Wang,Xiao Feng,Mingcheng Qu,Tonghua Su*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study proposes HMVLA, a Vision Language Action model that uses hierarchical semantic alignment in hyperbolic space and a gated expert mechanism, achieving higher accuracy and generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Action (VLA) methods struggle with semantic alignment challenges and often directly fine-tune pre-trained Vision-Language Models without fully leveraging hierarchical structure in multimodal data.

Method: The proposed method, HMVLA, embeds multimodal features in hyperbolic space for better hierarchical semantic alignment and incorporates a sparsely gated Mixture of Experts mechanism to enhance comprehension and efficiency across modalities.

Result: Experiments show HMVLA outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, generalization, and cross-domain adaptability, validating its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: HMVLA offers a novel hierarchical approach for addressing semantic alignment in Vision-Language Action tasks, showing improved performance and adaptability by leveraging hyperbolic embeddings and refined expert mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models have recently shown great potential in bridging multimodal perception with robotic control. However, existing methods often rely on direct fine-tuning of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), feeding semantic and visual features directly into a policy network without fully addressing the unique semantic alignment challenges in the VLA domain. In this paper, we propose HMVLA, a novel VLA framework that exploits the inherent hierarchical structures in vision and language for comprehensive semantic alignment. Unlike traditional methods that perform alignment in Euclidean space, our HMVLA embeds multimodal features in hyperbolic space, enabling more effective modeling of the hierarchical relationships present in image text data. Furthermore, we introduce a sparsely gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism tailored for semantic alignment, which enhances multimodal comprehension between images and text while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HMVLA surpasses baseline methods in both accuracy and generalization. In addition, we validate its robustness by reconstructing datasets to further test cross domain adaptability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: StepNav introduces structured multimodal trajectory priors to enhance autonomous visual navigation by ensuring safer, efficient, and robust pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating reliable trajectories for autonomous systems in cluttered, uncertain environments and overcoming the limitations of unstructured noise priors in existing generative models.

Method: StepNav creates geometry-aware success probability fields to represent navigation corridors, which are used to formulate multimodal trajectory priors and refine them via a conditional flow-matching process based on optimal control principles.

Result: StepNav consistently achieves improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners through experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach advances reliable trajectory generation for autonomous navigation systems and effectively addresses challenges by incorporating structured, physically-grounded strategy.

Abstract: Visual navigation is fundamental to autonomous systems, yet generating reliable trajectories in cluttered and uncertain environments remains a core challenge. Recent generative models promise end-to-end synthesis, but their reliance on unstructured noise priors often yields unsafe, inefficient, or unimodal plans that cannot meet real-time requirements. We propose StepNav, a novel framework that bridges this gap by introducing structured, multimodal trajectory priors derived from variational principles. StepNav first learns a geometry-aware success probability field to identify all feasible navigation corridors. These corridors are then used to construct an explicit, multi-modal mixture prior that initializes a conditional flow-matching process. This refinement is formulated as an optimal control problem with explicit smoothness and safety regularization. By replacing unstructured noise with physically-grounded candidates, StepNav generates safer and more efficient plans in significantly fewer steps. Experiments in both simulation and real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in robustness, efficiency, and safety over state-of-the-art generative planners, advancing reliable trajectory generation for practical autonomous navigation. The code has been released at https://github.com/LuoXubo/StepNav.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scalability, modularity, and reproducibility in autonomous racing through improved software design.

Method: Developed the modular AROLA architecture with standardized ROS 2 interfaces and the Race Monitor framework for performance logging and analysis.

Result: Validated AROLA's modularity and evaluation system both in simulations and physical trials, including a competition deployment.

Conclusion: AROLA and Race Monitor promote faster development, reproducibility, and systematic evaluation in autonomous racing.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has advanced rapidly, particularly on scaled platforms, and software stacks must evolve accordingly. In this work, AROLA is introduced as a modular, layered software architecture in which fragmented and monolithic designs are reorganized into interchangeable layers and components connected through standardized ROS 2 interfaces. The autonomous-driving pipeline is decomposed into sensing, pre-processing, perception, localization and mapping, planning, behavior, control, and actuation, enabling rapid module replacement and objective benchmarking without reliance on custom message definitions. To support consistent performance evaluation, a Race Monitor framework is introduced as a lightweight system through which lap timing, trajectory quality, and computational load are logged in real time and standardized post-race analyses are generated. AROLA is validated in simulation and on hardware using the RoboRacer platform, including deployment at the 2025 RoboRacer IV25 competition. Together, AROLA and Race Monitor demonstrate that modularity, transparent interfaces, and systematic evaluation can accelerate development and improve reproducibility in scaled autonomous racing.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces PokeNet, an end-to-end framework that estimates articulation models from single human demonstrations without prior object knowledge for effective robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on prior object knowledge, large datasets, or fail to account for manipulation order in multi-DoF articulated objects.

Method: PokeNet uses point cloud observations from human manipulation to predict joint parameters, infer manipulation order, and track joint states over time.

Result: PokeNet improves joint axis and state estimation accuracy by over 27% compared to state-of-the-art methods on unseen and novel objects in simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: PokeNet enables efficient, accurate, and order-aware articulation modeling using human demonstration, showcasing its superiority for downstream robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Articulation modeling enables robots to learn joint parameters of articulated objects for effective manipulation which can then be used downstream for skill learning or planning. Existing approaches often rely on prior knowledge about the objects, such as the number or type of joints. Some of these approaches also fail to recover occluded joints that are only revealed during interaction. Others require large numbers of multi-view images for every object, which is impractical in real-world settings. Furthermore, prior works neglect the order of manipulations, which is essential for many multi-DoF objects where one joint must be operated before another, such as a dishwasher. We introduce PokeNet, an end-to-end framework that estimates articulation models from a single human demonstration without prior object knowledge. Given a sequence of point cloud observations of a human manipulating an unknown object, PokeNet predicts joint parameters, infers manipulation order, and tracks joint states over time. PokeNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, improving joint axis and state estimation accuracy by an average of over 27% across diverse objects, including novel and unseen categories. We demonstrate these gains in both simulation and real-world environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel control system enabling individuals with quadriplegia due to cSCI to operate a mobile manipulator for household tasks through wearable high-density electromyography (HDEMG) sleeves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to empower individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) by enabling them to perform daily household tasks that are otherwise impossible due to paralysis, addressing the lack of accessible robot control interfaces.

Method: The authors developed custom HDEMG-enabled fabric forearm sleeves capturing neuromotor activity from paralyzed limbs to allow real-time gesture-based control of robots. They also integrated vision, language, and motion planning modules in a shared autonomy framework for efficient teleoperation.

Result: Through a twelve-day in-home user study, the system was successfully tested for real-time robot navigation and control, demonstrating its effectiveness in performing household tasks in a natural environment.

Conclusion: This system demonstrates significant potential as a tool for improving independence and quality of life for people with quadriplegia by enabling them to control robots for daily living tasks effectively.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in the home can enable people with cervical spinal cord injury (cSCI) to perform daily physical household tasks that they could not otherwise do themselves. However, paralysis in these users often limits access to traditional robot control interfaces such as joysticks or keyboards. In this work, we introduce and deploy the first system that enables a user with quadriplegia to control a mobile manipulator in their own home using bimanual high-density electromyography (HDEMG). We develop a pair of custom, fabric-integrated HDEMG forearm sleeves, worn on both arms, that capture residual neuromotor activity from clinically paralyzed degrees of freedom and support real-time gesture-based robot control. Second, by integrating vision, language, and motion planning modules, we introduce a shared autonomy framework that supports robust and user-driven teleoperation, with particular benefits for navigation-intensive tasks in home environments. Finally, to demonstrate the system in the wild, we present a twelve-day in-home user study evaluating real-time use of the wearable EMG interface for daily robot control. Together, these system components enable effective robot control for performing activities of daily living and other household tasks in a real home environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combine model-based control with diffusion models to address sensitivity to scheduling parameters, a major challenge in robotic control.

Method: Propose LP-MBD with linear probability paths inspired by flow matching, offering simpler and decoupled parameterization, and ALP-MBD to adapt diffusion using reinforcement learning.

Result: LP-MBD reduced tuning complexity while maintaining performance; ALP-MBD further increased robustness, adaptability, and efficiency in various experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance control performance, simplify diffusion parameter tuning, and offer adaptability in robotics control scenarios.

Abstract: The interest in combining model-based control approaches with diffusion models has been growing. Although we have seen many impressive robotic control results in difficult tasks, the performance of diffusion models is highly sensitive to the choice of scheduling parameters, making parameter tuning one of the most critical challenges. We introduce Linear Path Model-Based Diffusion (LP-MBD), which replaces the variance-preserving schedule with a flow-matching-inspired linear probability path. This yields a geometrically interpretable and decoupled parameterization that reduces tuning complexity and provides a stable foundation for adaptation. Building on this, we propose Adaptive LP-MBD (ALP-MBD), which leverages reinforcement learning to adjust diffusion steps and noise levels according to task complexity and environmental conditions. Across numerical studies, Brax benchmarks, and mobile-robot trajectory tracking, LP-MBD simplifies scheduling while maintaining strong performance, and ALP-MBD further improves robustness, adaptability, and real-time efficiency.

TL;DR: Kino-PAX$^{+}$ is a massively parallel kinodynamic motion planner with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees, offering up to three orders of magnitude faster solutions and lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of real-time performance in traditional sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) and improve objective function optimization through parallelization.

Method: Kino-PAX$^{+}$ utilizes massively parallel processing by decomposing serial operations into three parallel subroutines, focusing on promising nodes in local neighborhoods to improve solution cost.

Result: Kino-PAX$^{+}$ achieves up to three orders of magnitude faster solutions than serial methods and performs better in solution cost compared to a GPU-based planner.

Conclusion: Kino-PAX$^{+}$ successfully combines massive parallelism with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees, offering more efficient and cost-effective solutions for kinodynamic motion planning.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used for robot motion planning with complex kinodynamic constraints in high-dimensional spaces, yet they struggle to achieve \emph{real-time} performance due to their serial computation design. Recent efforts to parallelize SBMPs have achieved significant speedups in finding feasible solutions; however, they provide no guarantees of optimizing an objective function. We introduce Kino-PAX$^{+}$, a massively parallel kinodynamic SBMP with asymptotic near-optimal guarantees. Kino-PAX$^{+}$ builds a sparse tree of dynamically feasible trajectories by decomposing traditionally serial operations into three massively parallel subroutines. The algorithm focuses computation on the most promising nodes within local neighborhoods for propagation and refinement, enabling rapid improvement of solution cost. We prove that, while maintaining probabilistic $δ$-robust completeness, this focus on promising nodes ensures asymptotic $δ$-robust near-optimality. Our results show that Kino-PAX$^{+}$ finds solutions up to three orders of magnitude faster than existing serial methods and achieves lower solution costs than a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Language Movement Primitives (LMPs) framework, combining vision and language models (VLMs) with Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) for zero-shot robot manipulation, achieving an 80% task success rate across 20 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connecting abstract task reasoning with robot motion control remains a significant challenge in robotics, hindering effective manipulation using natural language instructions.

Method: The LMP framework links VLM reasoning with DMP parameterization, enabling the translation of free-form natural language task descriptions into stable trajectories and motion control.

Result: The approach effectively completes tabletop manipulation tasks with an 80% success rate, outperforming the best baseline which achieved 31%.

Conclusion: By integrating VLMs with DMPs, the LMP pipeline enables zero-shot manipulation, bridging high-level reasoning and low-level robot motion for novel tasks.

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform novel manipulation tasks from natural language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, despite significant progress in generalized problem solving with foundational models. Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline. See videos at our website: https://collab.me.vt.edu/lmp

*Kevin Alcedo,Pedro U. Lima,Rachid Alami*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for robots to handle decision-making in uncertain social environments by learning mental-models and estimating mental-states, rather than relying on intractable or brittle methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in human-environment interactions need to make decisions under uncertainty. Existing methods for reasoning about human mental models and states are either computationally intractable or inflexible in open-world scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced a neuro-symbolic world model with a discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network and a perspective-shift operator as an amortized Schrödinger Bridge to transition egocentric beliefs into other-centric beliefs. The system integrates local dynamics, social influences, and exogenous factors for socially-aware decision-making.

Result: Preliminary results in a MiniGrid social navigation task demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model for synthesizing socially-aware policies in model-based reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enables robots to better handle social uncertainties and interactions by learning structured mental models and performing decision-time mental-state planning.

Abstract: Operating in environments alongside humans requires robots to make decisions under uncertainty. In addition to exogenous dynamics, they must reason over others' hidden mental-models and mental-states. While Interactive POMDPs and Bayesian Theory of Mind formulations are principled, exact nested-belief inference is intractable, and hand-specified models are brittle in open-world settings. We address both by learning structured mental-models and an estimator of others' mental-states. Building on the Influence-Based Abstraction, we instantiate an Influence-Augmented Local Model to decompose socially-aware robot tasks into local dynamics, social influences, and exogenous factors. We propose (a) a neuro-symbolic world model instantiating a factored, discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network, and (b) a perspective-shift operator modeled as an amortized Schrödinger Bridge over the learned local dynamics that transports factored egocentric beliefs into other-centric beliefs. We show that this architecture enables agents to synthesize socially-aware policies in model-based reinforcement learning, via decision-time mental-state planning (a Schrödinger Bridge in belief space), with preliminary results in a MiniGrid social navigation task.

TL;DR: The study focuses on tackling challenges in UAV coordination and decision-making in GPS-denied environments using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in high-fidelity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the complexities of autonomous UAV exploration in distributed, uncertain environments with constraints like limited communication and no GPS.

Method: It uses MARL in a 2D simulator with continuous action spaces, combining LiDAR sensing, ND-POMDPs, and curriculum learning to train UAV collaboration effectively.

Result: The model enabled efficient, scalable, and rapid exploration with robust coordination under communication constraints and improved training efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust and efficient experimental foundation for deploying collaborative UAVs in real-world environments under uncertain and constrained conditions.

Abstract: The exploration of unknown, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments by an autonomous communication-aware and collaborative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges in coordination, perception, and decentralized decision-making. This paper implements Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these challenges in a 2D indoor environment, using high-fidelity game-engine simulations (Godot) and continuous action spaces. Policy training aims to achieve emergent collaborative behaviours and decision-making under uncertainty using Network-Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ND-POMDPs). Each UAV is equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and can share data (sensor measurements and a local occupancy map) with neighbouring agents. Inter-agent communication constraints include limited range, bandwidth and latency. Extensive ablation studies evaluated MARL training paradigms, reward function, communication system, neural network (NN) architecture, memory mechanisms, and POMDP formulations. This work jointly addresses several key limitations in prior research, namely reliance on discrete actions, single-agent or centralized formulations, assumptions of a priori knowledge and permanent connectivity, inability to handle dynamic obstacles, short planning horizons and architectural complexity in Recurrent NNs/Transformers. Results show that the scalable training paradigm, combined with a simplified architecture, enables rapid autonomous exploration of an indoor area. The implementation of Curriculum-Learning (five increasingly complex levels) also enabled faster, more robust training. This combination of high-fidelity simulation, MARL formulation, and computational efficiency establishes a strong foundation for deploying learned cooperative strategies in physical robotic systems.

TL;DR: FastDriveCoT accelerates the inference speed of CoT reasoning for vision-language-action models in autonomous driving by adopting parallel decoding techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate high inference latency caused by autoregressive CoT, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: FastDriveCoT leverages parallel decoding by structuring CoT reasoning into a dependency graph with independent subtasks to be processed simultaneously in a single forward pass.

Result: The method achieves 3-4x speedup in CoT generation, alongside a significant reduction in end-to-end latency, while maintaining task performance.

Conclusion: FastDriveCoT offers an efficient solution enabling real-time application of CoT reasoning in autonomous driving without compromising task improvements.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the decision-making capabilities of vision-language-action models in autonomous driving, but its autoregressive nature introduces significant inference latency, making it impractical for real-time applications. To address this, we introduce FastDriveCoT, a novel parallel decoding method that accelerates template-structured CoT. Our approach decomposes the reasoning process into a dependency graph of distinct sub-tasks, such as identifying critical objects and summarizing traffic rules, some of which can be generated in parallel. By generating multiple independent reasoning steps concurrently within a single forward pass, we significantly reduce the number of sequential computations. Experiments demonstrate a 3-4$\times$ speedup in CoT generation and a substantial reduction in end-to-end latency across various model architectures, all while preserving the original downstream task improvements brought by incorporating CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: DEFT is a new trajectory generator that enables robots to succeed despite actuation failures, proving resilience in simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot failures disrupt operations and demand human assistance; the motivation is achieving fail-active functioning to ensure task completion despite impairments.

Method: DEFT uses a diffusion-based trajectory generation approach conditioned on robot constraints and embodiment, enabling handling arbitrary actuation failures.

Result: DEFT outperformed baseline methods in simulations with joint-failure scenarios and succeeded in real-world tasks where traditional techniques failed.

Conclusion: DEFT demonstrates robust performance in fail-active manipulation during arbitrary failures, bridging simulation and practical real-world deployments.

Abstract: Robot failure is detrimental and disruptive, often requiring human intervention to recover. Maintaining safe operation under impairment to achieve task completion, i.e. fail-active operation, is our target. Focusing on actuation failures, we introduce DEFT, a diffusion-based trajectory generator conditioned on the robot's current embodiment and task constraints. DEFT generalizes across failure types, supports constrained and unconstrained motions, and enables task completion under arbitrary failure. We evaluated DEFT in both simulation and real-world scenarios using a 7-DoF robotic arm. In simulation over thousands of joint-failure cases across multiple tasks, DEFT outperformed the baseline by up to 2 times. On failures unseen during training, it continued to outperform the baseline, indicating robust generalization in simulation. Further, we performed real-world evaluations on two multi-step tasks, drawer manipulation and whiteboard erasing. These experiments demonstrated DEFT succeeding on tasks where classical methods failed. Our results show that DEFT achieves fail-active manipulation across arbitrary failure configurations and real-world deployments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight, modular, inflatable robotic system was developed for lunar applications, capable of adapting shapes, tilting, and locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a sustainable and adaptable robotic structure for lunar and space missions facing harsh conditions and compact design needs.

Method: The system uses inflatable fabric triangles, connected via roller units and a unique spherical joint, allowing reconfiguration. It employs an isoperimetric shape-changing mechanism without additional compressed air.

Result: The system achieved a 1:18.3 stowed-to-deployed volume ratio, demonstrated efficient solar array tilting and 14-degree-of-freedom locomotion.

Conclusion: The modular design effectively addresses challenges in lunar operations and future space exploration through adaptability and sustainability.

Abstract: We introduce a large-scale robotic system designed as a lightweight, modular, and reconfigurable structure for lunar applications. The system consists of truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through two robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A newly developed spherical joint enables up to three triangles to connect at a vertex, allowing construction of truss assemblies beyond a single octahedron. When deflated, the triangles compact to approximately the volume of the roller units, achieving a stowed-to-deployed volume ratio of 1:18.3. Upon inflation, the roller units pinch the tubes, locally reducing bending stiffness to form effective joints. Electric motors then translate the roller units along the tube, shifting the pinch point by lengthening one edge while shortening another at the same rate, thereby preserving a constant perimeter (isoperimetric). This shape-changing process requires no additional compressed air, enabling untethered operation after initial inflation. We demonstrate the system as a 12-degree-of-freedom solar array capable of tilting up to 60 degrees and sweeping 360 degrees, and as a 14-degree-of-freedom locomotion device using a step-and-slide gait. This modular, shape-adaptive system addresses key challenges for sustainable lunar operations and future space missions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'EAGLE', a framework enabling a unified control policy for managing multiple diverse humanoid robots without per-robot reward tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in applying a single control policy for diverse humanoid robots due to dynamics variations, degrees of freedom, and kinematic topology.

Method: EAGLE utilizes an iterative distillation process where generalist policies are refined using specialists trained on specific robots, cycling until convergence.

Result: EAGLE successfully demonstrated high tracking accuracy and robustness in both simulated and real-world experiments on various humanoid robots.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, robust humanoid control across different embodiments, supporting a range of behaviors and advancing fleet-level robot management.

Abstract: Humanoid Whole-Body Controllers trained with reinforcement learning (RL) have recently achieved remarkable performance, yet many target a single robot embodiment. Variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom (DoFs), and kinematic topology still hinder a single policy from commanding diverse humanoids. Moreover, obtaining a generalist policy that not only transfers across embodiments but also supports richer behaviors-beyond simple walking to squatting, leaning-remains especially challenging. In this work, we tackle these obstacles by introducing EAGLE, an iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy that controls multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning. During each cycle, embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. Repeating this loop until performance convergence produces a robust Whole-Body Controller validated on robots such as Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. We conducted experiments on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Through quantitative evaluations, EAGLE achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods, marking a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPL, a training framework for humanoid robots enabling robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains with payloads, emphasizing terrain-specific policies and transformer policy refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of robust multi-directional locomotion of humanoid robots on complex terrains, while incorporating payload handling capabilities.

Method: RPL employs a two-stage training framework with expert policies using height map observations, followed by a transformer policy refined with depth camera views and techniques like depth feature scaling and side masking.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates effective multi-directional locomotion across challenging terrains (slopes, staircases, stepping stones), maintaining robustness with payloads and showcasing real-world experimental validation.

Conclusion: RPL achieves scalable, efficient, and robust humanoid robot locomotion through innovative training and distillation techniques, offering significant advancements for navigation in complex terrains.

Abstract: Humanoid perceptive locomotion has made significant progress and shows great promise, yet achieving robust multi-directional locomotion on complex terrains remains underexplored. To tackle this challenge, we propose RPL, a two-stage training framework that enables multi-directional locomotion on challenging terrains, and remains robust with payloads. RPL first trains terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height map observations to master decoupled locomotion and manipulation skills across different terrains, and then distills them into a transformer policy that leverages multiple depth cameras to cover a wide range of views. During distillation, we introduce two techniques to robustify multi-directional locomotion, depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking, which are critical for asymmetric depth observations and unseen widths of terrains. For scalable depth distillation, we develop an efficient multi-depth system that ray-casts against both dynamic robot meshes and static terrain meshes in massively parallel environments, achieving a 5-times speedup over the depth rendering pipelines in existing simulators while modeling realistic sensor latency, noise, and dropout. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate robust multi-directional locomotion with payloads (2kg) across challenging terrains, including 20° slopes, staircases with different step lengths (22 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm), and 25 cm by 25 cm stepping stones separated by 60 cm gaps.

*Baixiao Huang,Baiyu Huang,Yu Hou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage deep reinforcement learning method for quadruped robots to improve stair-climbing and navigation abilities in complex indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance quadruped robots' performance during primary search tasks in indoor fires, focusing on challenges like stair climbing and situational awareness.

Method: A two-stage deep reinforcement learning framework: training quadruped robots first on pyramid-like stairs, then on realistic indoor staircases while balancing navigation and locomotion.

Result: The study demonstrated successful policy generalization for different stair types using local height-map perception, achieving robust performance across straight, L-shaped, and spiral staircases.

Conclusion: End-to-end RL techniques effectively empowered quadruped robots to climb diverse indoor staircases, advancing their capabilities for hazardous environments.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are used for primary searches during the early stages of indoor fires. A typical primary search involves quickly and thoroughly looking for victims under hazardous conditions and monitoring flammable materials. However, situational awareness in complex indoor environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircases remain the main challenges for robot-assisted primary searches. In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes. Our main contributions are: (1) A two-stage end-to-end RL framework that transfers stair-climbing skills from abstract pyramid terrain to realistic indoor stair topologies. (2) A centerline-based navigation formulation that enables unified learning of navigation and locomotion without hierarchical planning. (3) Demonstration of policy generalization across diverse staircases using only local height-map perception. (4) An empirical analysis of success, efficiency, and failure modes under increasing stair difficulty.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CdDrive, a system combining fixed trajectory vocabularies with scene-adaptive candidates, enhanced by an innovative noise adapter, to improve autonomous driving across simple and complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed trajectory vocabularies and scene-adaptive refinements in autonomous driving, particularly in balancing performance between routine and highly interactive scenarios.

Method: CdDrive integrates fixed trajectory vocabularies with scene-adaptive candidates generated through vocabulary-conditioned diffusion denoising. It uses HATNA (Horizon-Aware Trajectory Noise Adapter) to smooth the diffusion candidates and ensure geometric continuity. A shared module scores both candidate types for reliable decision-making.

Result: CdDrive demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v1 and NAVSIM v2, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its components.

Conclusion: CdDrive effectively balances stability in routine driving and adaptability in complex scenarios, offering a significant advancement in autonomous driving through its multimodal planning framework and innovative techniques.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving is increasingly adopting a multimodal planning paradigm that generates multiple trajectory candidates and selects the final plan, making candidate-set design critical. A fixed trajectory vocabulary provides stable coverage in routine driving but often misses optimal solutions in complex interactions, while scene-adaptive refinement can cause over-correction in simple scenarios by unnecessarily perturbing already strong vocabulary trajectories.We propose CdDrive, which preserves the original vocabulary candidates and augments them with scene-adaptive candidates generated by vocabulary-conditioned diffusion denoising. Both candidate types are jointly scored by a shared selection module, enabling reliable performance across routine and highly interactive scenarios. We further introduce HATNA (Horizon-Aware Trajectory Noise Adapter) to improve the smoothness and geometric continuity of diffusion candidates via temporal smoothing and horizon-aware noise modulation. Experiments on NAVSIM v1 and NAVSIM v2 demonstrate leading performance, and ablations verify the contribution of each component.

*Runfeng Zhu,Xin Zhong,Qingxiang Zhao,Jing Lin,Zhong Wu,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel robotized dissector for enhancing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy procedures, featuring improved dexterity and precision for accessing thin branches of pulmonary arteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surgical tools for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy lack flexibility and distal dexterity to access thin branches of pulmonary arteries, creating a need for innovative solutions.

Method: The paper develops a concentric push/pull robotic (CPPR) dissector, designing it as a slender instrument with dual-segment-bending dexterity, incorporating endoscopic capabilities and open-loop kinematics for accurate manipulation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the robot's stiffness, motion accuracy, and maneuverability. The device showcased 2mm precision in tip tool positioning and improved performance in simulations on porcine lungs.

Conclusion: Endoscopic pulmonary thromboendarterectomy could be significantly enhanced using the CPPR-based dissector, highlighting its potential to transform traditional surgical approaches.

Abstract: Patients suffering chronic severe pulmonary thromboembolism need Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy (PTE) to remove the thromb and intima located inside pulmonary artery (PA). During the surgery, a surgeon holds tweezers and a dissector to delicately strip the blockage, but available tools for this surgery are rigid and straight, lacking distal dexterity to access into thin branches of PA. Therefore, this work presents a novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot (CPPR) structure, enabling entering deep thin branch of tortuous PA. Compared with conventional rigid dissectors, our design characterizes slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity. Owing to the hollow and thin-walled structure of the CPPR-based dissector as it has a slender body of 3.5mm in diameter, the central lumen accommodates two channels for irrigation and tip tool, and space for endoscopic camera's signal wire. To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy. As such, with the endoscopic camera, traditional PTE is possible to be upgraded as endoscopic PTE. Basic physic performance of the robotized dissector including stiffness, motion accuracy and maneuverability was evaluated through experiments. Surgery simulation on ex vivo porcine lung also demonstrates its dexterity and notable advantages in PTE.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to combat backdoor attacks in vision-language-action (VLA) models without requiring retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses against backdoor attacks in robotic VLA models are computationally intensive or lack insight into multimodal attacks, leaving these systems vulnerable.

Method: The authors propose Bera, a test-time framework that utilizes deep-layer attention cues to identify and remove backdoor triggers without retraining the model.

Result: Experiments show that Bera reduces backdoor attack success rates, restores correct behaviors, and maintains nominal performance across various platforms and tasks.

Conclusion: Bera provides an effective and practical solution to secure VLA models in robotics against backdoor attacks, requiring no changes to training.

Abstract: Downstream fine-tuning of vision-language-action (VLA) models enhances robotics, yet exposes the pipeline to backdoor risks. Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for estimating ground reaction forces (GRFs) using marker-based motion capture data instead of force plates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical workflows rarely use GRF due to the limitations of force plates, despite its importance in gait analysis.

Method: A marker-based motion capture system to estimate GRFs by calculating the center of mass (CoM) and using a minimization-based approach to decompose forces.

Result: The method successfully estimates GRFs and gait stance phases using kinematic data, making force plates unnecessary.

Conclusion: This approach offers a clinically viable and practical solution for enhancing gait analysis without relying on dedicated force plate systems.

Abstract: Ground reaction forces (GRFs) provide fundamental insight into human gait mechanics and are widely used to assess joint loading, limb symmetry, balance control, and motor function. Despite their clinical relevance, the use of GRF remains underutilised in clinical workflows due to the practical limitations of force plate systems. In this work, we present a force-plate-free approach for estimating GRFs using only marker-based motion capture data. This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach. Through this framework, we can identify gait stance phases and provide access to clinically meaningful kinetic measures without a dedicated force plate system. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of extensive data requirements and low adaptability in imitation learning for robots, particularly for complex and long-horizon tasks.

Method: The framework uses a two-layer architecture with an upper layer for long-term planning and a lower layer for learning individual motion primitives, integrating them proportionally. Three model variants are proposed to optimize flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability.

Result: The models generated complex motions not included in the primitive set, with the sampling-based and playback-based proportion models showing improved stability and adaptability in real-robot experiments.

Conclusion: Proportion-based motion synthesis in hierarchical IL improves data efficiency and adaptability, making it a practical approach for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire human-like motion skills from demonstrations, but it still requires extensive high-quality data and retraining to handle complex or long-horizon tasks. To improve data efficiency and adaptability, this study proposes a hierarchical IL framework that integrates motion primitives with proportion-based motion synthesis. The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set. The sampling-based and playback-based proportion models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than the standard hierarchical model, demonstrating the effectiveness of proportion-based motion integration for practical robot learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of humanoid skateboarding, which involves dynamic maneuvering, hybrid contact dynamics, and balance control in a highly dynamic and complex interaction environment.

Method: The authors introduce HUSKY, a learning-based framework combining humanoid-skateboard system modeling, adversarial motion priors for learning human-like pushing motions, and a physics-guided control strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors.

Result: HUSKY demonstrated stable and agile humanoid skateboarding maneuvers on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed HUSKY framework effectively addresses the challenges of humanoid skateboarding with an innovative combination of modeling, control strategies, and learning-based methods.

Abstract: While current humanoid whole-body control frameworks predominantly rely on the static environment assumptions, addressing tasks characterized by high dynamism and complex interactions presents a formidable challenge. In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: Field robots in unstructured environments need robust perception, but monocular depth estimation faces challenges such as ambiguous conditions, lack of scale cues, and limited datasets.

Method: The authors propose a depth completion model trained on synthetic datasets created using a pipeline leveraging textured 3D meshes and photorealistic rendering. The model uses sparse input from depth sensors to predict dense depth.

Result: The model achieves real-time performance with 53 ms latency per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin and competitive depth estimation across diverse real-world robotics scenarios.

Conclusion: The research provides a practical solution for field robotics perception challenges by combining synthetic data training, sparse sensor input, and real-time capability.

Abstract: Autonomous field robots operating in unstructured environments require robust perception to ensure safe and reliable operations. Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of UAV collisions with power lines due to challenges in detection motivates the development of a robust sensing system.

Method: A lightweight spherical sensing system with compact solid-state mmWave radar modules is designed for omnidirectional power line detection. A tailored algorithm is developed for detection and avoidance.

Result: The system reliably detects power lines up to 10 m, avoids them at speeds over 10 m/s, and detects wires as thin as 1.2 mm diameter.

Conclusion: The system is effective as an added safety layer for both autonomous and manual UAV flight in environments with power lines.

Abstract: Detecting and estimating distances to power lines is a challenge for both human UAV pilots and autonomous systems, which increases the risk of unintended collisions. We present a mmWave radar-based perception system that provides spherical sensing coverage around a small UAV for robust power line detection and avoidance. The system integrates multiple compact solid-state mmWave radar modules to synthesize an omnidirectional field of view while remaining lightweight. We characterize the sensing behavior of this omnidirectional radar arrangement in power line environments and develop a robust detection-and-avoidance algorithm tailored to that behavior. Field experiments on real power lines demonstrate reliable detection at ranges up to 10 m, successful avoidance maneuvers at flight speeds upwards of 10 m/s, and detection of wires as thin as 1.2 mm in diameter. These results indicate the approach's suitability as an additional safety layer for both autonomous and manual UAV flight.

*Yanchen Shen,Kohei Tsuji,Haruto Koizumi,Jiseon Hong,Tomoaki Niiyama,Hiroyuki Kuwabara,Hayato Ishida,Jun Hiramitsu,Mitsuhito Mase,Satoshi Sunada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a compact and soft optical tactile sensor that uses a speckle-based approach for force measurement and texture recognition, showing high accuracy and mechanical compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing optical tactile sensors, which are bulky, rigid, and sensitive to alignment, and to develop a more compact, flexible, and efficient tactile sensing solution.

Method: The study developed an alignment-free and soft optical sensor that captures deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns within silicone material. Machine learning was used for precise force measurements and texture recognition.

Result: The sensor achieved a force measurement error of 40 mN and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine textured surfaces.

Conclusion: The proposed sensor demonstrates a novel, compact, and flexible tactile sensing platform suitable for applications in soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial in robotics and wearable devices for safe perception and interaction with the environment. Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDCOL, a framework for implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics that resolves limitations in degenerate configurations through geometric regularization, improving smoothness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome non-smooth mappings in robot state-to-contact scenarios caused by degenerate configurations with zero or undefined curvature in robotics.

Method: The authors use geometric regularization to transform shapes into strictly convex implicit representations, enabling smooth contact mapping. They derive analytical derivatives via the Implicit Function Theorem and develop a fast Newton-based solver, implemented in open-source C++.

Result: iDCOL demonstrates robust performance through extensive collision simulations and benchmarks. It is successfully applied to gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics.

Conclusion: Geometric regularization and implicit representation provide a robust and efficient solution for differentiable contact kinematics, enhancing robotics applications such as path planning and multi-body dynamics.

Abstract: Differentiable contact kinematics are essential for gradient-based methods in robotics, yet the mapping from robot state to contact distance, location, and normal becomes non-smooth in degenerate configurations of shapes with zero or undefined curvature. We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework. The robustness of the approach is evaluated through extensive collision simulations and benchmarking, and applicability is demonstrated in gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, including multi-body rigid collisions and a soft-robot interaction example.

TL;DR: RDT2 is a robotic foundation model designed for zero-shot deployment on new robotic platforms, achieving generalization across objects, scenes, and tasks with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models face challenges including data limitations, inefficiencies, and lack of generalization across robotic platforms.

Method: RDT2 incorporates a new training recipe using Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), flow-matching, and distillation on a large open-source dataset collected using an embodiment-agnostic interface.

Result: The model achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen objects, scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms, surpassing baseline performances in various complex scenarios like table tennis.

Conclusion: RDT2 sets a new standard for generalist robotics and demonstrates significant advancements in zero-shot learning across diverse tasks and hardware systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold promise for generalist robotics but currently struggle with data scarcity, architectural inefficiencies, and the inability to generalize across different hardware platforms. We introduce RDT2, a robotic foundation model built upon a 7B parameter VLM designed to enable zero-shot deployment on novel embodiments for open-vocabulary tasks. To achieve this, we collected one of the largest open-source robotic datasets--over 10,000 hours of demonstrations in diverse families--using an enhanced, embodiment-agnostic Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI). Our approach employs a novel three-stage training recipe that aligns discrete linguistic knowledge with continuous control via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), flow-matching, and distillation for real-time inference. Consequently, RDT2 becomes one of the first models that simultaneously zero-shot generalizes to unseen objects, scenes, instructions, and even robotic platforms. Besides, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in dexterous, long-horizon, and dynamic downstream tasks like playing table tennis. See https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt2/ for more information.

*Haegu Lee,Yitaek Kim,Casper Hewson Rask,Christoffer Sloth*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model for contact-rich manipulation, demonstrating its advantages over point contact models through trajectory and force optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point contact models are computationally efficient but cannot emulate human-like manipulation, as they fail to capture complex frictional dynamics and torque generation required for contact-rich tasks.

Method: The paper presents a bi-level optimization framework using a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model. The lower level solves contact force computation while the upper level uses iLQR for trajectory optimization.

Result: The FDLC model outperforms conventional point contact models by enabling efficient and robust trajectories, requiring lower control effort and less robot motion.

Conclusion: FDLC is more effective in contact-rich manipulation, especially for generating non-uniform force distributions, making it a superior alternative to point contact models.

Abstract: Efficient and robust trajectories play a crucial role in contact-rich manipulation, which demands accurate mod- eling of object-robot interactions. Many existing approaches rely on point contact models due to their computational effi- ciency. Simple contact models are computationally efficient but inherently limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich ma- nipulation, as they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation. This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Learning-based Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms" for quadruped robots to overcome balancing challenges on dynamic platforms, utilizing adaptive policies and state estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots struggle to maintain balance on platforms with six-degrees-of-freedom motions like buses or subways, due to unpredictable inertia forces.

Method: They propose a self-balancing policy that adapts to the platform's motion and use state estimators based on proprioceptive sensor data for inferring robot and platform states. Systematic training is achieved using a platform trajectory generation and scheduling method.

Result: Experimental evaluations show superior balancing performance of the proposed LAS-MP compared to three baseline models. Ablation studies and estimator evaluations confirm the effectiveness of individual components.

Conclusion: The LAS-MP demonstrates improved balancing for quadruped robots and systematic training strategies validate the robustness of the system in varying platform conditions.

Abstract: A quadruped robot faces balancing challenges on a six-degrees-of-freedom moving platform, like subways, buses, airplanes, and yachts, due to independent platform motions and resultant diverse inertia forces on the robot. To alleviate these challenges, we present the Learning-based Active Stabilization on Moving Platforms (\textit{LAS-MP}), featuring a self-balancing policy and system state estimators. The policy adaptively adjusts the robot's posture in response to the platform's motion. The estimators infer robot and platform states based on proprioceptive sensor data. For a systematic training scheme across various platform motions, we introduce platform trajectory generation and scheduling methods. Our evaluation demonstrates superior balancing performance across multiple metrics compared to three baselines. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the \textit{LAS-MP}, including ablation studies and evaluation of the estimators, to validate the effectiveness of each component.

*Constantin Selzer,Fabina B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Plan Transformer (PTR) to bridge the gap between trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving by integrating prediction and planning constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory prediction and planning are disconnected in autonomous driving, creating bottlenecks such as lack of supervision for agent intentions in prediction and unmet constraints like collision avoidance in planning.

Method: PTR employs a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework with goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. It uses a teacher-student training strategy to handle unavailable agent intentions during inference.

Result: PTR improves marginal/joint mAP by 4.3%/3.5% compared to the Motion Transformer baseline, reduces planning error by 15.5% at a 5-second horizon compared to GameFormer, and supports architecture-agnostic application to Transformer-based models.

Conclusion: PTR effectively aligns trajectory prediction and planning, addressing critical autonomous driving bottlenecks, and enhances prediction accuracy and planning reliability.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental yet disconnected components in autonomous driving. Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer. The architecture-agnostic design enables application to diverse Transformer-based prediction models. Project Website: https://github.com/SelzerConst/PlanTRansformer

TL;DR: The paper proposes RL-ATR, enabling quadruped robots to use personal transporters for more efficient navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped robots face limitations in efficiency and range due to sole reliance on legged locomotion.

Method: The authors designed RL-ATR, incorporating a transporter riding policy and state estimators overcoming control and sensor challenges.

Result: Simulations showed consistent command tracking, versatility across models, and reduced energy use compared to pure legged motion.

Conclusion: RL-ATR enhances navigation efficiency and operational range of quadruped robots by enabling transporter usage.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face limitations in long-range navigation efficiency due to their reliance on legs. To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manual ESD procedures are technically challenging, and current robotic tools lack dexterity. This paper aimed to develop a robotic system with enhanced control and precision for efficient lesion targeting.

Method: DESectBot, a novel dual-segment continuum robot, was developed with integrated surgical forceps and GRU-based deep learning controllers. The controllers handle nonlinear couplings for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, outperforming traditional and alternative methods (e.g., MPC, FNN, LSTM).

Result: The GRU controller achieved significantly lower position and orientation RMSEs during trajectory tracking and peg transfer tasks, outperforming novice-controlled systems. Ex vivo ESD demonstrations confirmed sufficient stiffness and precision for surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: The GRU-based DESectBot improves precision, reliability, and usability in robotic ESD, offering a valuable advancement for surgical training and procedures.

Abstract: Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.

### [556] [Learning-based Initialization of Trajectory Optimization for Path-following Problems of Redundant Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03418)
*Minsung Yoon,Mincheul Kang,Daehyung Park,Sung-Eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning-based method to generate high-quality initial trajectories for redundant manipulators, enhancing trajectory optimization (TO) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem with current trajectory optimization lies in the difficulty of selecting high-quality initial trajectories due to the vast solution space and lack of prior task knowledge, which consumes significant time.

Method: The authors propose a learning-based initial trajectory generation method using example-guided reinforcement learning and introduce a novel null-space projected imitation reward that incorporates null-space constraints from expert motion demonstrations.

Result: Simulations demonstrate improved trajectory optimization in terms of optimality, efficiency, and applicability compared to three baseline methods, while real-world experiments verify the feasibility using a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.

Conclusion: By employing example-guided reinforcement learning and null-space projection, the proposed method generates efficient initial trajectories, significantly enhancing TO performance both in simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Trajectory optimization (TO) is an efficient tool to generate a redundant manipulator's joint trajectory following a 6-dimensional Cartesian path. The optimization performance largely depends on the quality of initial trajectories. However, the selection of a high-quality initial trajectory is non-trivial and requires a considerable time budget due to the extremely large space of the solution trajectories and the lack of prior knowledge about task constraints in configuration space. To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines. We also show the performance improvement and feasibility via real-world experiments with a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProAct-75, a benchmark for training and evaluating proactive agents in various domains using explicit task graphs for decision-making. The ProAct-Helper baseline, powered by a Multimodal Large Language Model, outperforms previous models in performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized resources limits the development of proactive agents that can align with higher-level objectives like assistance and safety.

Method: ProAct-75 includes 75 tasks with 91,581 step-level annotations and explicit task graphs. The ProAct-Helper integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model for state detection and utilizes task graphs in an entropy-driven heuristic search for parallel action selection.

Result: ProAct-Helper achieves improvements, with a 6.21% increase in trigger detection mF1, saving 0.25 steps in online decision, and raising parallel action rates by 15.58% compared to existing models.

Conclusion: ProAct-75 and ProAct-Helper advance the training and evaluation of proactive agents, showing significant improvements in decision-making and action efficiency through the use of task graphs.

Abstract: While passive agents merely follow instructions, proactive agents align with higher-level objectives, such as assistance and safety by continuously monitoring the environment to determine when and how to act. However, developing proactive agents is hindered by the lack of specialized resources. To address this, we introduce ProAct-75, a benchmark designed to train and evaluate proactive agents across diverse domains, including assistance, maintenance, and safety monitoring. Spanning 75 tasks, our dataset features 91,581 step-level annotations enriched with explicit task graphs. These graphs encode step dependencies and parallel execution possibilities, providing the structural grounding necessary for complex decision-making. Building on this benchmark, we propose ProAct-Helper, a reference baseline powered by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that grounds decision-making in state detection, and leveraging task graphs to enable entropy-driven heuristic search for action selection, allowing agents to execute parallel threads independently rather than mirroring the human's next step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProAct-Helper outperforms strong closed-source models, improving trigger detection mF1 by 6.21%, saving 0.25 more steps in online one-step decision, and increasing the rate of parallel actions by 15.58%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores optimal control strategies for underactuated continuum soft robots performing dynamic tasks, making use of analytical derivatives and efficient numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quasi-static control approaches aren't sufficient for addressing challenging dynamic tasks in continuum soft robots, especially hybrid rigid-soft systems. There is a need for improved methods to exploit continuum dynamics effectively.

Method: The study employs optimal control strategies (Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control) using analytical derivatives from the Geometric Variable Strain model, along with implicit integration and warm-start strategies to enhance performance.

Result: Three benchmark systems - Soft Cart-Pole, Soft Pendubot, and Soft Furuta Pendulum - are successfully used to evaluate the proposed methods, demonstrating their computational trade-offs and robust performance.

Conclusion: Optimal control methods with analytical derivatives and advanced simulation techniques improve the dynamic control of underactuated soft robots, offering insights into their application and efficiency.

Abstract: Continuum soft robots are inherently underactuated and subject to intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control particularly challenging, especially in hybrid rigid-soft robots. While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: HetroD is a dataset and benchmark tailored for autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous traffic, emphasizing vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets representing real-world heterogeneous traffic involving complex VRU behaviors in order to improve autonomous driving systems' capability in such environments.

Method: Collected a large-scale drone-based dataset with traffic scenes, centimeter-level annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. Developed a modular toolkit for scenario extraction and offered benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks.

Result: Over 65.4k agent trajectories were captured, with 70% involving VRUs. State-of-the-art models struggle on benchmarks, revealing challenges in predicting VRU behaviors, handling unstructured maneuvers, and navigating dense, multi-agent scenarios.

Conclusion: HetroD demonstrates the limitations of current autonomous systems in managing heterogeneous traffic and underlines the necessity for more resilient approaches to account for diverse, real-world VRU dynamics.

Abstract: We present HetroD, a dataset and benchmark for developing autonomous driving systems in heterogeneous environments. HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of robust disturbance rejection during humanoid locomotion on unstructured terrains with noisy perception, proposing a Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the enduring challenge of disturbance rejection in humanoid locomotion, especially on unpredictable terrains where noisy sensors and model mismatches hinder performance.

Method: The authors introduce the CMR framework, combining contrastive representation learning and Lipschitz regularization to create a robust latent space. This framework can be added to reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary term, requiring minimal technical effort.

Result: The authors demonstrate, through extensive humanoid experiments, that the CMR framework outperforms other locomotion algorithms under noisy environments.

Conclusion: CMR is an effective and practical tool for improving robustness in humanoid locomotion, particularly under noisy and uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Robust disturbance rejection remains a longstanding challenge in humanoid locomotion, particularly on unstructured terrains where sensing is unreliable and model mismatch is pronounced. While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study assesses how spatial ability impacts learning experiences with AR in robot programming, finding AR compensates for learners with lower spatial abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual learner characteristics, specifically spatial ability, interact with AR to influence the learning experience in robot programming.

Method: A between-subjects experiment (N=71) compared regular and AR-assisted robot programming using a head-mounted display, measuring spatial ability with a Mental Rotation Test and learning outcomes via the System Usability Scale and cognitive load.

Result: AR did not significantly improve overall learning experience but helped mitigate disadvantages for learners with lower spatial abilities by lessening their cognitive challenges.

Conclusion: AR can act as a compensatory tool in learning, neutralizing disparities caused by varying spatial abilities, suggesting its potential for personalized education design to support diverse learners.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, integrating quantum mechanics principles into decision-making for automated driving, addressing interaction-awareness challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in automated driving by addressing oversimplified interaction models and the inability of classical game theory to handle human uncertainty.

Method: The QGDM framework combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics concepts like superposition and entanglement for decision-making in multi-agent scenarios.

Result: Simulations in various driving scenarios (roundabouts, merging, highways) demonstrated that QGDM improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: QGDM provides a more robust decision-making approach for automated driving, better handling complex interactions and yielding improved performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction.

*Lorena Maria Genua,Nikita Boguslavskii,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARFA, an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators based on capabilities, historical performance, urgency, and workload distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robots struggling in dynamic environments and requiring human intervention for recovery, improving human-robot collaboration.

Method: ARFA models operator capabilities and updates beliefs using actual performance. It uses a reward function to allocate failure based on urgency, workload, and operator suitability.

Result: Simulations and user studies demonstrate ARFA reduces robot idle time, improves system performance, and balances operator workload.

Conclusion: ARFA offers an effective allocation mechanism, enhancing collaboration and performance in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Since the recent Covid-19 pandemic, mobile manipulators and humanoid assistive robots with higher levels of autonomy have increasingly been adopted for patient care and living assistance. Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework for manipulating deformable linear objects, achieving robust and generalizable performance in rope stabilization and trajectory tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to advance dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, addressing challenges in accurately modeling object dynamics, self-supervised learning processes, and achieving robustness in real-world applications.

Method: The authors developed SPiD, which combines an extended mass-spring model for accurate object dynamics and a task-specific neural controller trained with a self-supervised DAgger variant to detect and address distribution shifts during deployment.

Result: SPiD demonstrated fast and robust rope stabilization across various conditions (e.g., different rope lengths, masses, and disturbances) and equally succeeded in trajectory tracking with noisy, low-frequency inputs.

Conclusion: SPiD is a data-efficient and generalized framework with strong sim-to-real performance for manipulating deformable linear objects, offering robustness against noise, varying conditions, and external disturbances.

Abstract: We address dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects by presenting SPiD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework that couples an accurate deformable object model with an augmented self-supervised training strategy. On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization.

*Fabian Schramm,Franki Nguimatsia Tiofack,Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert,Marc Toussaint,Justin Carpentier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework is proposed, leveraging a prior model and a quadratic approximation to enhance sample efficiency and performance in low-sample regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based controllers like MPPI often face challenges such as high variance and low sample efficiency, making their application less practical in scenarios with limited or costly samples.

Method: A hybrid MPPI framework which decomposes the objective into a known model and a residual term. Using a quadratic approximation, a model-guided prior concentrates samples in meaningful areas, improving efficiency.

Result: Validation across optimization benchmarks, cart-pole control, and manipulation tasks demonstrates faster convergence and improved performance relative to standard MPPI, especially in low-sample settings.

Conclusion: The method substantially enhances sample-based control strategies, making them more feasible for applications with constrained sampling scenarios.

Abstract: Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVP-LAM, a model to learn latent actions from multi-view videos for robot learning, enhancing VLA model pretraining and manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific datasets by using latent actions derived from diverse human videos as pseudo-action labels.

Method: MVP-LAM learns discrete latent actions from multi-view synchronized videos with a cross-viewpoint reconstruction objective to mitigate reliance on viewpoint-specific cues.

Result: MVP-LAM improves latent actions' informativeness, achieves better mutual information with ground-truth actions, enhances action prediction, and bolsters downstream manipulation performance.

Conclusion: Using MVP-LAM latent actions benefits VLA model pretraining and downstream robot learning tasks by delivering action-centric latent representations.

Abstract: Learning \emph{latent actions} from diverse human videos enables scaling robot learning beyond embodiment-specific robot datasets, and these latent actions have recently been used as pseudo-action labels for vision-language-action (VLA) model pretraining. To make VLA pretraining effective, latent actions should contain information about the underlying agent's actions despite the absence of ground-truth labels. We propose \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew\textbf{P}oint \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}ction \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MVP-LAM}), which learns discrete latent actions that are highly informative about ground-truth actions from time-synchronized multi-view videos. MVP-LAM trains latent actions with a \emph{cross-viewpoint reconstruction} objective, so that a latent action inferred from one view must explain the future in another view, reducing reliance on viewpoint-specific cues. On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks.

*Martin Günther,Felix Igelbrink,Oscar Lima,Lennart Niecksch,Marian Renz,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG)-based mapping approach that integrates perception and knowledge representation for improved reasoning in large-scale environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in consistency and scalability of deploying Open Set Semantic Mapping and 3DSSGs effectively for reasoning in real-world environments.

Method: The proposed method uses a mapping architecture that positions a 3DSSG as the primary framework for knowledge representation. It builds on incremental scene graph prediction to update and maintain a topologically consistent and computationally efficient map in real-time.

Result: The approach ensures spatially grounded, verifiable representations that seamlessly connect raw sensor data to symbolic reasoning. This structure allows knowledge-driven frameworks, such as ontologies and LLMs, to operate with improved trustworthiness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Using 3DSSG as the core representation enhances interpretability and alignment of autonomous agents with human concepts, bridging a critical gap between sub-symbolic data and high-level reasoning.

Abstract: While Open Set Semantic Mapping and 3D Semantic Scene Graphs (3DSSGs) are established paradigms in robotic perception, deploying them effectively to support high-level reasoning in large-scale, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process.
  Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts.

*Yixiang Chen,Peiyan Li,Jiabing Yang,Keji He,Xiangnan Wu,Yuan Xu,Kai Wang,Jing Liu,Nianfeng Liu,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BridgeV2W is a new approach to align coordinate-space actions with video generation models, offering improved video quality and unified architecture across robotic embodiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in embodied world models, such as misalignment of coordinate actions vs. video pixels, sensitivity to viewpoints, and lack of unified architectures.

Method: BridgeV2W converts actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks and uses a ControlNet-style injection method to integrate them into video generation models, including flow-based motion loss to focus on dynamic areas.

Result: BridgeV2W demonstrates superior video generation quality across single- and dual-arm robot datasets under challenging conditions and showcases effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: BridgeV2W advances video generation in robotics by improving alignment, robustness to viewpoints, and applicability to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Embodied world models have emerged as a promising paradigm in robotics, most of which leverage large-scale Internet videos or pretrained video generation models to enrich visual and motion priors. However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a probabilistic verification framework for designing safe control policies in unknown dynamical systems using conformal prediction and reachability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in safe control designs for unknown or stochastic systems with finite state and action spaces.

Method: The authors use conformal prediction to determine uncertainty intervals and employ reachability analysis for verifying safety. They also introduce an algorithm for training control policies that optimize reward and maximize safety guarantees.

Result: Evaluation across seven safe control settings showed strong provable safety guarantees, alongside sustained high average reward across multiple domains and specifications.

Conclusion: This framework proves effective in ensuring safety while optimizing rewards in unknown dynamical systems, showing applicability across diverse domains.

Abstract: Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward.

*Srinivas Rao Marri*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a development methodology called Constitutional Spec-Driven Development to embed security principles in AI-generated code by incorporating a machine-readable 'Constitution' layer based on known vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-assisted coding often prioritizes coding functionality over security, leading to vulnerabilities; this paper aims to proactively integrate security into the AI development process.

Method: The methodology embeds a machine-readable Constitution to enforce security constraints derived from the CWE/MITRE Top 25 vulnerabilities, demonstrated in a banking microservices application.

Result: The proposed approach reduced security defects by 73% in AI-generated code, addressing critical vulnerabilities while maintaining development speed.

Conclusion: Proactive security specification through Constitutional Spec-Driven Development ensures more secure AI-generated code compared to traditional reactive methods, with broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-assisted "vibe coding" enables rapid software development but introduces significant security risks, as Large Language Models (LLMs) prioritize functional correctness over security. We present Constitutional Spec-Driven Development, a methodology that embeds non-negotiable security principles into the specification layer, ensuring AI-generated code adheres to security requirements by construction rather than inspection. Our approach introduces a Constitution: a versioned, machine-readable document encoding security constraints derived from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)/MITRE Top 25 vulnerabilities and regulatory frameworks. We demonstrate the methodology through a banking microservices application, selected as a representative example domain due to its stringent regulatory and security requirements, implementing customer management, account operations, and transaction processing. The methodology itself is domain-agnostic. The implementation addresses 10 critical CWE vulnerabilities through constitutional constraints with full traceability from principles to code locations. Our case study shows that constitutional constraints reduce security defects by 73% compared to unconstrained AI generation while maintaining developer velocity. We contribute a formal framework for constitutional security, a complete development methodology, and empirical evidence that proactive security specification outperforms reactive security verification in AI-assisted development workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of manual alert triage in enterprise systems, which delays incident recovery.

Method: Developed and deployed an agentic observability framework using a ReAct paradigm to autonomously handle alert triage.

Result: The framework reduced the mean time to insight by 90% in production deployment, maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate agentic AI's potential to revolutionize observability in enterprise systems by significantly improving efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Modern enterprise systems exhibit complex interdependencies that make observability and incident response increasingly challenging. Manual alert triage, which typically involves log inspection, API verification, and cross-referencing operational knowledge bases, remains a major bottleneck in reducing mean recovery time (MTTR). This paper presents an agentic observability framework deployed within Adobe's e-commerce infrastructure that autonomously performs alert triage using a ReAct paradigm. Upon alert detection, the agent dynamically identifies the affected service, retrieves and analyzes correlated logs across distributed systems, and plans context-dependent actions such as handbook consultation, runbook execution, or retrieval-augmented analysis of recently deployed code. Empirical results from production deployment indicate a 90% reduction in mean time to insight compared to manual triage, while maintaining comparable diagnostic accuracy. Our results show that agentic AI enables an order-of-magnitude reduction in triage latency and a step-change in resolution accuracy, marking a pivotal shift toward autonomous observability in enterprise operations.

TL;DR: The paper surveys challenges and techniques in testing storage-system correctness, emphasizing execution properties, failure mechanisms, and the application of fuzzing and AI-based automatic testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Storage systems remain difficult to test systematically despite their critical role in computing and decades of research, due to inherent challenges like nondeterminism, long-term state changes, and complex multi-layered semantics.

Method: The authors review and organize a wide range of testing techniques (e.g., concurrency testing, crash-consistency analysis, and distributed fault injection) and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. They explore the potential of fuzzing and artificial intelligence advancements.

Result: The survey presents a comprehensive framework for understanding storage-system testing and identifies mismatches between current testing approaches and storage semantics. It also proposes AI-based solutions as a complement to traditional fuzzing.

Conclusion: This work unifies knowledge about storage-system correctness testing, identifies significant challenges, and suggests incorporating AI for semantic and state-aware testing improvements.

Abstract: Storage systems are fundamental to modern computing infrastructures, yet ensuring their correctness remains challenging in practice. Despite decades of research on system testing, many storage-system failures (including durability, ordering, recovery, and consistency violations) remain difficult to expose systematically. This difficulty stems not primarily from insufficient testing tooling, but from intrinsic properties of storage-system execution, including nondeterministic interleavings, long-horizon state evolution, and correctness semantics that span multiple layers and execution phases.
  This survey adopts a storage-centric view of system testing and organizes existing techniques according to the execution properties and failure mechanisms they target. We review a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from concurrency testing and long-running workloads to crash-consistency analysis, hardware-level semantic validation, and distributed fault injection, and analyze their fundamental strengths and limitations. Within this framework, we examine fuzzing as an automated testing paradigm, highlighting systematic mismatches between conventional fuzzing assumptions and storage-system semantics, and discuss how recent artificial intelligence advances may complement fuzzing through state-aware and semantic guidance. Overall, this survey provides a unified perspective on storage-system correctness testing and outlines key challenges

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of robust strategies for repairing system crashes in the Linux kernel caused by kernel fuzzers, proposing tools for live evaluation and resolution benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more dynamic and uncontaminated evaluation method for agents resolving Linux kernel crashes, countering static, outdated standards.

Method: Introduced 'Live-kBench', a self-evolving bug evaluation framework, and 'kEnv', a standard crash-resolution environment to assess agents' effectiveness in solving Linux kernel bugs.

Result: Benchmarked three leading agents, showing 74% plausible crash resolutions but with only ~20% matching actual developer fixes, and noted feedback improved resolution success by 29%.

Conclusion: The study provides a dynamic and fair benchmarking infrastructure (Live-kBench) and highlights significant performance gaps and improvement opportunities for kernel crash resolution agents.

Abstract: Repairing system crashes discovered by kernel fuzzers like Syzkaller is a critical yet underexplored challenge in software engineering. While recent works have introduced Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for Linux kernel crash-resolution, their evaluation benchmarks are usually static and thus, do not capture the evolving nature of the Linux kernel, and suffer from potential data contamination due to LLM knowledge cutoffs. To address the above problem, we present (i) Live-kBench, an evaluation framework for self-evolving benchmarks that continuously scrapes and evaluates agents on freshly discovered kernel bugs, and (ii) kEnv, an agent-agnostic standardized crash-resolution environment for kernel compilation, execution, and feedback. This design decouples agent workflows from heavy-weight execution, enabling fair and scalable comparison across diverse agent frameworks under identical conditions.
  To this end, we curate an inaugural dataset of 534 Linux kernel bugs and empirically demonstrate a significant performance gap, with agents achieving up to 25% higher equivalent patch rate on bugs fixed before the LLM knowledge cutoff. Using kEnv, we benchmark three state-of-the-art agents, showing that they resolve 74% of crashes on the first attempt (plausible patches); however only ~20% of generated patches closely match developer fixes. Additionally, exposing crash resolution feedback improves crash resolution rate by 29%. Live-kBench provides the community with an evaluation infrastructure for self-evolving benchmarks that is both time and attribute sensitive; complete with a public dashboard to track agent progress on Linux kernel bugs.

Motivation: The authors aim to close the performance gap between LLMs and Bayesian methods in high-dimensional optimization problems by investigating efficient methods for integrating domain knowledge.

Method: The study tests four approaches: (1) Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge Prompting (H-DKP), (2) Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP), (3) Dimension-Aware Progressive Refinement (DAPR), and (4) Hybrid Knowledge-Model Approach (HKMA) on datasets stratified by dimensionality.

Result: These architectures are assessed based on their ability to improve LLM-generated warm starts, using metrics like Chebyshev distance and ranking via Scott-Knott clustering.

Conclusion: Integration of structured domain knowledge has the potential to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in tackling high-dimensional optimization problems.

Abstract: Background/Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on low-dimensional software engineering optimization tasks ($\le$11 features) but consistently underperform on high-dimensional problems where Bayesian methods dominate. A fundamental gap exists in understanding how systematic integration of domain knowledge (whether from humans or automated reasoning) can bridge this divide.
  Objective/Aim: We compare human versus artificial intelligence strategies for generating domain knowledge. We systematically evaluate four distinct architectures to determine if structured knowledge integration enables LLMs to generate effective warm starts for high-dimensional optimization.
  Method: We evaluate four approaches on MOOT datasets stratified by dimensionality: (1) Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge Prompting (H-DKP), utilizing asynchronous expert feedback loops; (2) Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP), implementing sequential constraint identification and validation; (3) Dimension-Aware Progressive Refinement (DAPR), conducting optimization in progressively expanding feature subspaces; and (4) Hybrid Knowledge-Model Approach (HKMA), synthesizing statistical scouting (TPE) with RAG-enhanced prompting. Performance is quantified via Chebyshev distance to optimal solutions and ranked using Scott-Knott clustering against an established baseline for LLM generated warm starts.
  Note that all human studies conducted as part of this study will comply with the policies of our local Institutional Review Board.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how individuals with cognitive impairments (IwCI) can be better supported in navigation tasks by highlighting the role of proxy stakeholders in assisting with such tasks and offering design recommendations for adaptive navigation technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many navigation tools are not designed to accommodate the diverse needs of individuals with cognitive impairments, posing challenges for independent living. The study focuses on understanding and improving the support provided to IwCI during navigation.

Method: The study uses a mixed-methods approach, including an international survey and a three-stage interview process, to capture strategies used by proxy stakeholders in assisting IwCI's navigation.

Result: The study identifies challenges faced by IwCI and their proxy stakeholders and synthesizes these into design recommendations that focus on customizability, routine-based navigation, and multi-user coordination.

Conclusion: By introducing the concept of proxy stakeholders into software engineering, the study proposes a more inclusive approach to designing navigation technologies, aiming to cater to the complex needs of cognitive support.

Abstract: Wayfinding, or the ability to navigate one's surroundings, is crucial for independent living and requires a complex combination of cognitive abilities, environmental awareness, and technology to manage this successfully. Individuals with cognitive impairment (IwCI) often face significant challenges in learning and navigating their environment. Despite its importance, mainstream navigation technologies are rarely designed with their diverse needs in mind. This study reframes the search for places as a socially distributed task and emphasizes the role of proxy stakeholders, who act on behalf or in coordination with IwCI during navigation. Using a qualitatively led mixed-methods approach, which includes an international survey and a three-stage interview study, we examine the real-world strategies that proxy stakeholders employ to support daily navigation. The findings are synthesized into a set of empirically grounded design recommendations that emphasize customisability, collaborative use, and support for routine-based navigation. Our findings highlight key challenges and adaptive practices, which are synthesized into design recommendations that prioritize customisability, routine-based navigation, and multi-user coordination. By introducing the proxy stakeholder concept into the software engineering literature, we propose a more inclusive approach to requirements elicitation and offer practical guidance for designing navigation technologies that better reflect the complex realities of cognitive support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verification systems focus on isolated correctness proofs, limiting progress and reusability in system verification.

Method: The paper suggests a hybrid framework combining large language models with graph-based representations for scalable semantic matching and artifact reuse, ensuring soundness via symbolic matching.

Result: Enhanced compositional reasoning and systematic ecosystems will accelerate assurance by leveraging past verification efforts.

Conclusion: A knowledge-driven approach integrating AI with formal methods will enable continuous synthesis and reuse, guiding the next generation of verification systems.

Abstract: This vision paper articulates a long-term research agenda for formal methods at the intersection with artificial intelligence, outlining multiple conceptual and technical dimensions and reporting on our ongoing work toward realising this agenda. It advances a forward-looking perspective on the next generation of formal methods based on the integration of automated contract synthesis, semantic artifact reuse, and refinement-based theory. We argue that future verification systems must move beyond isolated correctness proofs toward a cumulative, knowledge-driven paradigm in which specifications, contracts, and proofs are continuously synthesised and transferred across systems. To support this shift, we outline a hybrid framework combining large language models with graph-based representations to enable scalable semantic matching and principled reuse of verification artifacts. Learning-based components provide semantic guidance across heterogeneous notations and abstraction levels, while symbolic matching ensures formal soundness. Grounded in compositional reasoning, this vision points toward verification ecosystems that evolve systematically, leveraging past verification efforts to accelerate future assurance.

Method: An empirical study of 25 GitHub projects was conducted, testing progressive prompting and enhancement strategies like self-critique and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for various failure types.

Result: Progressive prompting achieved 96.9% task completion, outperforming direct prompting. RAG showed the best overall performance, while self-critique was suited only for specific failures (e.g., logic errors).

Conclusion: The authors propose a decision framework guiding developers on when to use specific enhancement strategies, bridging gaps in unmet requirements in LLM-aided software development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating software development by translating requirements into code. However, even advanced prompting workflows like progressive prompting often leave some requirements unmet. Although methods such as self-critique, multi-model collaboration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been proposed to address these gaps, developers lack clear guidance on when to use each. In an empirical study of 25 GitHub projects, we found that progressive prompting achieves 96.9% average task completion, significantly outperforming direct prompting (80.5%, Cohen's d=1.63, p<0.001) but still leaving 8 projects incomplete. For 6 of the most representative projects, we evaluated each enhancement strategy across 4 failure types. Our results reveal that method effectiveness depends critically on failure characteristics: Self-Critique succeeds on code-reviewable logic errors but fails completely on external service integration (0% improvement), while RAG achieves highest completion across all failure types with superior efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose a decision framework that maps each failure pattern to the most suitable enhancement method, giving practitioners practical, data-driven guidance instead of trial-and-error.

### [579] [Beyond Blame: Rethinking SZZ with Knowledge Graph Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02934)
*Yu Shi,Hao Li,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents AgenticSZZ, a novel approach to identifying Bug-Inducing Commits (BICs) through Temporal Knowledge Graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of SZZ-based bug-inducing commit identification, which heavily relies on 'git blame' and often fails in over 40% of cases.

Method: The paper proposes AgenticSZZ, employing a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) framework for BIC identification in two phases: TKG construction and graph search using an LLM agent.

Result: AgenticSZZ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving F1-scores of 0.48 to 0.74 across three datasets, with up to 27% improvement over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The study introduces an advanced way to reconstruct and analyze software evolution by transforming BIC detection into a temporal graph search problem, opening a new avenue for research.

Abstract: Identifying Bug-Inducing Commits (BICs) is fundamental for understanding software defects and enabling downstream tasks such as defect prediction and automated program repair. Yet existing SZZ-based approaches are limited by their reliance on git blame, which restricts the search space to commits that directly modified the fixed lines. Our preliminary study on 2,102 validated bug-fixing commits reveals that this limitation is significant: over 40% of cases cannot be solved by blame alone, as 28% of BICs require traversing commit history beyond blame results and 14% are blameless.
  We present AgenticSZZ, the first approach to apply Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to software evolution analysis. AgenticSZZ reframes BIC identification from a ranking problem over blame commits into a graph search problem, where temporal ordering is fundamental to causal reasoning about bug introduction. The approach operates in two phases: (1) constructing a TKG that encodes commits with temporal and structural relationships, expanding the search space by traversing file history backward from two reference points (blame commits and the BFC); and (2) leveraging an LLM agent to navigate the graph using specialized tools for candidate exploration and causal analysis.
  Evaluation on three datasets shows that AgenticSZZ achieves F1-scores of 0.48 to 0.74, with statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art by up to 27%. Our ablation study confirms that both components are essential, reflecting a classic exploration-exploitation trade-off: the TKG expands the search space while the agent provides intelligent selection. By transforming BIC identification into a graph search problem, we open a new research direction for temporal and causal reasoning in software evolution analysis.

### [580] [Testing Framework Migration with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02964)
*Altino Alves,João Eduardo Montandon,Andre Hora*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This research explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate migrations of Python test frameworks from unittest to Pytest. The study uses real-world migrations and evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 under different conditions, achieving a 48.5% success rate in migrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the manual and time-intensive process of transitioning Python test suites from unittest to Pytest, providing a more efficient, automated solution using LLMs.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4) using a curated migration dataset and various prompting strategies (Zero-shot, One-shot, and Chain-of-Thought) with different temperature settings. It also executes the migrated test suites to assess accuracy.

Result: 51.5% of LLM-generated migrations failed, while 48.5% succeeded. Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrated conservative migrations, while GPT-4o was more transformational.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist in automated test migrations, but their effectiveness varies. Additionally, both tools offer unique migration characteristics, presenting opportunities but also limitations for practitioners.

Abstract: Python developers rely on two major testing frameworks: \texttt{unittest} and \texttt{Pytest}. While \texttt{Pytest} offers simpler assertions, reusable fixtures, and better interoperability, migrating existing suites from \texttt{unittest} remains a manual and time-consuming process. Automating this migration could substantially reduce effort and accelerate test modernization. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test framework migrations from \texttt{unittest} to \texttt{Pytest}. We evaluate GPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 4 under three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, One-shot, and Chain-of-Thought) and two temperature settings (0.0 and 1.0). To support this analysis, we first introduce a curated dataset of real-world migrations extracted from the top 100 Python open-source projects. Next, we actually execute the LLM-generated test migrations in their respective test suites. Overall, we find that 51.5% of the LLM-generated test migrations failed, while 48.5% passed. The results suggest that LLMs can accelerate test migration, but there are often caveats. For example, Claude Sonnet 4 exhibited more conservative migrations (e.g., preserving class-based tests and legacy \texttt{unittest} references), while GPT-4o favored more transformations (e.g., to function-based tests). We conclude by discussing multiple implications for practitioners and researchers.

### [581] [Understanding Bug-Reproducing Tests: A First Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02965)
*Andre Hora,Gordon Fraser*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies bug-reproducing tests in Python systems, finding minimal differences compared to other tests but identifying specific distinctions like the use of try/except blocks and weak assertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to fill the gap in research regarding the properties and behaviors of bug-reproducing tests, which are designed to confirm bug fixes and help catch regressions.

Method: An empirical study analyzing 642 bug-reproducing tests across 15 Python systems, examining their properties and comparing them with other types of tests.

Result: Bug-reproducing tests showed minimal statistical differences in terms of length, complexity, and assertions but had slightly more try/except blocks and weak assertions. Most tests targeted single bugs, with a minority targeting multiple bugs.

Conclusion: Bug-reproducing tests are fundamentally similar to other types of tests but differ slightly in certain characteristics. Future research is needed to understand broader implications and refine testing practices.

Abstract: Developers create bug-reproducing tests that support debugging by failing as long as the bug is present, and passing once the bug has been fixed. These tests are usually integrated into existing test suites and executed regularly alongside all other tests to ensure that future regressions are caught. Despite this co-existence with other types of tests, the properties of bug-reproducing tests are scarcely researched, and it remains unclear whether they differ fundamentally. In this short paper, we provide an initial empirical study to understand bug-reproducing tests better. We analyze 642 bug-reproducing tests of 15 real-world Python systems. Overall, we find that bug-reproducing tests are not (statistically significantly) different from other tests regarding LOC, number of assertions, and complexity. However, bug-reproducing tests contain slightly more try/except blocks and ``weak assertions'' (e.g.,~\texttt{assertNotEqual}). Lastly, we detect that the majority (95%) of the bug-reproducing tests reproduce a single bug, while 5% reproduce multiple bugs. We conclude by discussing implications and future research directions.

TL;DR: Analyzed testing practices in contribution guidelines of Python and JavaScript open-source projects. Found 78% included test documentation, focused mostly on running tests rather than writing them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the testing practices communicated in contribution guidelines of open-source projects and their importance.

Method: Empirical study analyzing contribution guidelines of 200 Python and JavaScript open-source projects.

Result: 78% of projects had test documentation; mostly focused on running tests (83.5%), less on writing tests (37%). Documentation often addressed unit tests (71%), with limited information on integration (20.5%) and end-to-end tests (15.5%).

Conclusion: Test documentation is present but lacks comprehensive guidance on writing tests and addressing broader testing aspects, paving the way for improved guidelines and future research.

Abstract: Software testing plays a crucial role in the contribution process of open-source projects. For example, contributions introducing new features are expected to include tests, and contributions with tests are more likely to be accepted. Although most real-world projects require contributors to write tests, the specific testing practices communicated to contributors remain unclear. In this paper, we present an empirical study to understand better how software testing is approached in contribution guidelines. We analyze the guidelines of 200 Python and JavaScript open-source software projects. We find that 78\% of the projects include some form of test documentation for contributors. Test documentation is located in multiple sources, including \texttt{CONTRIBUTING} files (58\%), external documentation (24\%), and \texttt{README} files (8\%). Furthermore, test documentation commonly explains how to run tests (83.5\%), but less often provides guidance on how to write tests (37\%). It frequently covers unit tests (71\%), but rarely addresses integration (20.5\%) and end-to-end tests (15.5\%). Other key testing aspects are also less frequently discussed: test coverage (25.5\%) and mocking (9.5\%). We conclude by discussing implications and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the importance of maintaining the balance between funded research and hands-on models in the organization of software engineering research.

Method: The authors analyze the historical development, current trends, and consequences of declining heterogeneity in SE research organization.

Result: The paper identifies a shift towards funded research dominance, which poses a threat to the diversity in SE research practices.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for preserving the heterogeneity in SE research to ensure its continued growth and interdisciplinary success.

Abstract: The heterogeneity in the organization of software engineering (SE) research historically exists, i.e., funded research model and hands-on model, which makes software engineering become a thriving interdisciplinary field in the last 50 years. However, the funded research model is becoming dominant in SE research recently, indicating such heterogeneity has been seriously and systematically threatened. In this essay, we first explain why the heterogeneity is needed in the organization of SE research, then present the current trend of SE research nowadays, as well as the consequences and potential futures. The choice is at our hands, and we urge our community to seriously consider maintaining the heterogeneity in the organization of software engineering research.

*Ziyue Hua,Tianyu Chen,Yeyun Gong,Shuai Lu,Peng Cheng,Qinglin Zhu,Yibo He,Yingjie Fu,Wenpin Jiao,Wei Yang,Tao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for generating automatic unit tests with accurate assertions and reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations by leveraging a self-debugging, data-distillation approach. Results show improved metrics over current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unit test generation methods struggle with producing tests that have correct assertions and reliable CoT explanations, largely due to inadequate training data.

Method: The authors propose a guided test repair system for iterative debugging and a CoT compression method for concise explanations. These were applied to generate high-quality training data for fine-tuning a model.

Result: The fine-tuned model showed a 36.17% pass rate on test assertions, 43.90% branch coverage, and 88.66% mutation score, outperforming state-of-the-art models like o4-mini.

Conclusion: By combining self-debugging and CoT compression, the proposed method significantly improves the effectiveness of automatic unit test generation and sets a benchmark for future techniques.

Abstract: Automatic unit test (UT) generation is essential for software quality assurance, but existing approaches--including symbolic execution, search-based approaches, and recent LLM-based generators--struggle to produce human-quality tests with correct, meaningful assertions and reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. We identify a gap in UT training data: repository-mined tests lack developer CoTs, while LLM-distilled CoTs are often incorrect or incomplete. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-distillation approach that uses self-debugging to produce high-quality UT training examples paired with faithful CoTs. Our approach combines (1) guided test repair, a heuristic loop (error-, failure-, and coverage-focused steps) that asks the used model to diagnose and iteratively fix generated tests, and (2) CoT compression, which compacts original and debugging CoTs into concise explanations that directly justify correct tests. We apply this pipeline to a large corpus of open-source projects to construct a dataset of 74,518 high-quality <focal method, test, CoT> examples, and then use it for supervised fine-tuning of a base model. An empirical evaluation shows that the fine-tuned model achieves high UT generation effectiveness: it attains a pass rate of 36.17% on test assertions, a branch coverage of 43.90%, and a mutation score of 88.66%, substantially higher than state-of-the-art commercial models like o4-mini.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing testing solutions are not suited for conversational AI due to their unique interaction characteristics and AI component behavior.

Method: The thesis focuses on validating conversational AI systems at various granularity levels, including integration of components, individual agents, and multi-agent systems.

Result: A comprehensive investigation providing innovative testing approaches for conversational AI systems.

*Jintai Li,Songqiang Chen,Shuo Jin,Xiaoyuan Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the limitations of current LLMs in generating code summaries and introduces ExpSum, a method tailored for industrial documentation requirements. ExpSum significantly improves performance over established benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code summarization methods fall short of meeting developers' and industrial requirements for accurate, expectation-aligned documentation.

Method: The authors propose ExpSum, a system that integrates metadata abstraction, metadata filtering, domain-knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting for LLMs to produce structured and industrial-relevant code summaries.

Result: ExpSum outperforms existing methods, with up to 26.71% improvement in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L in HarmonyOS, and aligns better with developer expectations on other projects.

Conclusion: ExpSum proves more effective in generating industrial-relevant code summaries and bridges the gap between generated summaries and developer expectations in industrial settings.

Abstract: Code summaries are essential for helping developers understand code functionality and reducing maintenance and collaboration costs. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details.
  To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluations indicate that ExpSum-generated summaries better align with developer expectations across other projects, demonstrating its effectiveness for industrial code documentation.

Motivation: The authors aim to develop a reliable, transparent, and reproducible framework for advancing research on software engineering agents, addressing the need to build systems with long-horizon task-solving capabilities.

Method: The process involves systematic exploration of agent development, including teacher-trajectory synthesis, data curation, strategic fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL) with real execution feedback, and designing inference frameworks.

Result: SWE-Master achieves a 61.4% resolve rate using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on SWE-bench Verified, surpassing existing baselines. Incorporating test-time scaling (TTS) improves performance to 70.8% at TTS@8.

Conclusion: SWE-Master offers a reproducible foundation and has demonstrated strong performance for building advanced software engineering agents. The code is openly accessible for further study and development.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present SWE-Master, an open-source and fully reproducible post-training framework for building effective software engineering agents. SWE-Master systematically explores the complete agent development pipeline, including teacher-trajectory synthesis and data curation, long-horizon SFT, RL with real execution feedback, and inference framework design. Starting from an open-source base model with limited initial SWE capability, SWE-Master demonstrates how systematical optimization method can elicit strong long-horizon SWE task solving abilities. We evaluate SWE-Master on SWE-bench Verified, a standard benchmark for realistic software engineering tasks. Under identical experimental settings, our approach achieves a resolve rate of 61.4\% with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines. By further incorporating test-time scaling~(TTS) with LLM-based environment feedback, SWE-Master reaches 70.8\% at TTS@8, demonstrating a strong performance potential.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-World, a Docker-free framework for training software engineering agents, replacing physical execution with a learned surrogate model, significantly improving efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing approaches for training software engineering agents heavily rely on resource-intensive physical execution environments like Docker, which are difficult to maintain and limit scalability.

Method: SWE-World replaces the physical containerized environments with LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interactions to predict execution outcomes and test feedback, eliminating the need for physical setup and optimizing agents efficiently.

Result: SWE-World significantly improves performance on the SWE-bench dataset, raising accuracy from 6.2% to 68.2% through Docker-free SFT, Docker-free RL, and test-time scaling.

Conclusion: SWE-World offers a scalable and efficient solution for software agent training by eliminating the dependency on physical environments, demonstrating strong experimental results and test-time scaling advantages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled software engineering agents to tackle complex code modification tasks. Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\% to 52.0\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\% with further TTS.

*Ruwei Pan,Yakun Zhang,Qingyuan Liang,Yueheng Zhu,Chao Liu,Lu Zhang,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAL-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for application-level code generation including functional and non-functional quality measures. Tests show that current LLMs struggle in achieving functional correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate whether current LLMs can generate application-level repositories that meet functional correctness and non-functional quality requirements since existing benchmarks focus only on snippet-level or limited assessments.

Method: RAL-Bench was developed, relying on natural-language requirements, functional and non-functional tests derived from system tests, ISO/IEC 25010-inspired metrics, and Analytic Hierarchy Process for quality scoring.

Result: Testing 16 LLMs under zero-shot and greedy decoding conditions revealed that functional correctness is the main bottleneck, with no model exceeding a 45% pass rate for functional tests.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are significantly limited for application-level code generation, particularly in producing functionally correct and high-quality runnable repositories. RAL-Bench serves as a tool for rigorous evaluation.

Abstract: Code generation has advanced rapidly with code-focused large language models (LLMs), especially on snippet-level tasks. However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests. We release RAL-Bench at https://github.com/Wwstarry/RAL-Bench. .

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model-based approach for generating Assurance Case (AC) evidence using formal verification, automating much of the process and improving consistency in robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The safety of Robotics and Autonomous Systems in critical domains requires reliable Assurance Cases, but current methods demand significant manual effort and are prone to errors.

Method: The paper employs a domain-specific language, RoboChart, to structure the process, combining model checking and theorem proving to automate assertion derivation and evidence incorporation.

Result: The approach automates the transformation of requirements into formal assertions and integrates verification results into the evidence, showcasing effectiveness through case studies.

Conclusion: Embedding formal verification into assurance workflows improves the efficiency and reliability of Assurance Case evidence, addressing common challenges in safety-critical robotic systems.

Abstract: Robotics and Autonomous Systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, so that demonstrating their safety is essential. Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [591] [Flaky Tests in a Large Industrial Database Management System: An Empirical Study of Fixed Issue Reports for SAP HANA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03556)
*Alexander Berndt,Thomas Bach,Sebastian Baltes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses flaky tests in software, proposing an approach using LLMs for automated labeling of root causes in issue reports, applied to SAP HANA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests complicate code quality assessment and automated evaluations, requiring manual and tedious identification of their root causes.

Method: Utilized LLMs to annotate issue reports by analyzing root causes using intra- and inter-model consistency.

Result: Applied to SAP HANA's database system, found commonly that concurrency-related issues caused flakiness (23% of analyzed reports).

Conclusion: Cross-test flakiness challenges require further generalizable approaches, encouraging future studies on mitigation tailored to different test types.

Abstract: Flaky tests yield different results when executed multiple times for the same version of the source code. Thus, they provide an ambiguous signal about the quality of the code and interfere with the automated assessment of code changes. While a variety of factors can cause test flakiness, approaches to fix flaky tests are typically tailored to address specific causes. However, the prevalent root causes of flaky tests can vary depending on the programming language, application domain, or size of the software project. Since manually labeling flaky tests is time-consuming and tedious, this work proposes an LLMs-as-annotators approach that leverages intra- and inter-model consistency to label issue reports related to fixed flakiness issues with the relevant root cause category. This allows us to gain an overview of prevalent flakiness categories in the issue reports. We evaluated our labeling approach in the context of SAP HANA, a large industrial database management system. Our results suggest that SAP HANA's tests most commonly suffer from issues related to concurrency (23%, 130 of 559 analyzed issue reports). Moreover, our results suggest that different test types face different flakiness challenges. Therefore, we encourage future research on flakiness mitigation to consider evaluating the generalizability of proposed approaches across different test types.

### [592] [Scaling Test-Driven Code Generation from Functions to Classes: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03557)
*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Shiwen Ni,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents an iterative test-driven development (TDD) approach that scales LLM-generated code testing from functions to classes, yielding improved class-level correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing TDD-based LLM code generation research, which mainly focuses on function-level tasks, by extending it to class-level synthesis where methods interact through shared states and dependencies.

Method: The authors propose an iterative TDD framework that analyzes intra-class method dependencies, generates a schedule, and incrementally implements each method using public tests, execution feedback, and bounded repair iterations.

Result: Their empirical study shows that their approach improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 points across eight LLMs, achieving up to 71% fully correct classes with minimal additional repair efforts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that test-driven code generation can effectively scale to class-level tasks, enhancing class-level code generation reliability.

Abstract: Test-driven development (TDD) has been adopted to improve Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation by using tests as executable specifications. However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

### [593] [Causal Inference for the Effect of Code Coverage on Bug Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03585)
*Lukas Schulte,Gordon Fraser,Steffen Herbold*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the causal effect of code coverage on bug introduction in open source JavaScript/TypeScript projects using causal inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the disputed causal relationship and optimal level of code coverage in reducing bugs, addressing gaps in prior research that relied only on correlational data.

Method: The study uses causal directed acyclic graphs to identify confounders and applies doubly robust regression-based causal inference, leveraging a dataset of bug-introducing and non-bug-introducing changes.

Result: The research estimates the average treatment effect and explores non-linear dose-response patterns to provide insights on the impact of code coverage.

Conclusion: The outcomes aim to offer evidence-based guidance on the advisable level of code coverage, informing software quality assurance practices.

Abstract: Context: Code coverage is widely used as a software quality assurance measure. However, its effect, and specifically the advisable dose, are disputed in both the research and engineering communities. Prior work reports only correlational associations, leaving results vulnerable to confounding factors. Objective: We aim to quantify the causal effect of code coverage (exposure) on bug introduction (outcome) in the context of mature JavaScript and TypeScript open source projects, addressing both the overall effect and its variance across coverage levels. Method: We construct a causal directed acyclic graph to identify confounders within the software engineering process, modeling key variables from the source code, issue- and review systems, and continuous integration. Using generalized propensity score adjustment, we will apply doubly robust regression-based causal inference for continuous exposure to a novel dataset of bug-introducing and non-bug-introducing changes. We estimate the average treatment effect and dose-response relationship to examine potential non-linear patterns (e.g., thresholds or diminishing returns) within the projects of our dataset.

*Valerie Chen,Jasmyn He,Behnjamin Williams,Jason Valentino,Ameet Talwalkar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores how to measure the impact of AI coding assistants on developer productivity using surveys and interviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding if traditional measures of developer productivity still apply in the age of AI coding assistants.

Method: The paper employs a mixed-method approach, conducting a survey with 2989 developers and 11 in-depth interviews to gain insights.

Result: The study identifies six distinct factors affecting productivity, emphasizing the importance of both short-term and long-term metrics, such as technical expertise and ownership of work.

Conclusion: A multifaceted and human-centered approach to measuring productivity impacts of AI tools is essential, encouraging holistic industry practices and future research directions.

Abstract: Measuring developer productivity is a topic that has attracted attention from both academic research and industrial practice. In the age of AI coding assistants, it has become even more important for both academia and industry to understand how to measure their impact on developer productivity, and to reconsider whether earlier measures and frameworks still apply. This study analyzes the validity of different approaches to evaluating the productivity impacts of AI coding assistants by leveraging mixed-method research. At BNY Mellon, we conduct a survey with 2989 developer responses and 11 in-depth interviews. Our findings demonstrate that a multifaceted approach is needed to measure AI productivity impacts: survey results expose conflicting perspectives on AI tool usefulness, while interviews elicit six distinct factors that capture both short-term and long-term dimensions of productivity. In contrast to prior work, our factors highlight the importance of long-term metrics like technical expertise and ownership of work. We hope this work encourages future research to incorporate a broader range of human-centered factors, and supports industry in adopting more holistic approaches to evaluating developer productivity.

### [595] [CALM: A Self-Adaptive Orchestration Approach for QoS-Aware Routing in Small Language Model based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03632)
*Hemang Jain,Divyansh Pandey,Karthik Vaidhyanathan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces CALM, a mechanism to orchestrate a fleet of Small Language Models (SLMs) for adaptive and efficient response handling under runtime uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses runtime uncertainties in AI systems enabled by Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on issues like dynamic workloads and response variability. It aims to improve efficiency and overcome shortcomings of single-model approaches.

Method: The authors propose CALM, a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism using the MAPE-K framework. CALM dynamically monitors and routes queries to the optimal SLM, leveraging caching and scheduling to reduce latency and energy usage.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that CALM achieves significant reductions in latency (40%) and energy consumption (50%), while preserving task performance compared to single-LLM systems.

Conclusion: Deploying a fleet of specialized SLMs with intelligent orchestration offers a resource-efficient alternative to LLMs, improving system performance and adaptability without compromising functionality.

Abstract: AI-enabled systems are subjected to various types of runtime uncertainties, ranging from dynamic workloads, resource requirements, model drift, etc. These uncertainties have a big impact on the overall Quality of Service (QoS). This is particularly true in the case of Language Model (LM) enabled systems where the autoregressive nature of token generation introduces variability in latency, energy usage and response quality. These systems, powered by LLMs, are either resource-intensive (if run on-prem) or raise privacy/cost concerns (if leveraged using APIs). While deploying a Small Language Model (SLM) can be resource-efficient, it often falls short in addressing the diversity and scale of real-world requirements. To this, we argue that, rather than relying on any one SLM, leveraging a coordinated fleet of SLMs, each with specialized strengths can enable systems to dynamically adapt to shifting contexts and workload patterns. However, realizing the full potential of such an approach demands intelligent orchestration and continuous adaptation. To this end, we introduce CALM , a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism based on MAPE-K. Our approach continuously monitors user queries, analyzes the QoS metrics of the SLMs, identifies the optimal SLM to be used, routes the query to the identified SLM and further to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency, leverages caching and scheduling to decide the SLMs to be kept in memory. Our evaluation shows that CALM reduces latency by approximately 40% and energy consumption by 50%, while preserving domain-specific task performance when compared to single-LLM baselines.

### [596] [SWE-Refactor: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Real-World LLM-Based Code Refactoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03712)
*Yisen Xu,Jinqiu Yang,Tse-Hsun,Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Refactor, a benchmark designed for evaluating code refactoring capabilities of large language models (LLMs), derived from real-world Java projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code refactoring are inadequate due to limited coverage, mixed changes, and lack of proper context, emphasizing the need for a better evaluation standard.

Method: SWE-Refactor collects 1,099 verified developer-written refactorings from 18 Java projects, ensuring correctness through compilation, test execution, and automated detection tools.

Result: Nine LLMs were evaluated on this benchmark, revealing challenges in handling complex and compound refactorings; for instance, the OpenAI Codex agent succeeded in only 39.4% of compound cases.

Conclusion: SWE-Refactor improves refactoring evaluation by offering realistic scenarios and validated instances, aiming to guide future research in LLM-based refactoring.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently attracted wide interest for tackling software engineering tasks. In contrast to code generation, refactoring demands precise, semantics-preserving edits that improve program structure, which also makes automated evaluation challenging. However, existing refactoring benchmarks commonly suffer from three shortcomings: limited coverage of refactoring scenarios, the inclusion of instances that mix refactoring with unrelated changes, and insufficient repository-level context for realistic assessment. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SWE-Refactor, a new benchmark for LLM-based code refactoring. SWE-Refactor comprises 1,099 developer-written, behavior-preserving refactorings mined from 18 Java projects, including 922 atomic and 177 compound instances. Each instance is validated via compilation, test execution, and automated refactoring detection tools to ensure correctness. We evaluate nine widely used LLMs on SWE-Refactor, covering models such as GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and CodeLLaMa, to provide representative reference results. Our results show that complex and compound refactorings remain the primary source of failures; notably, an OpenAI Codex agent achieves only 39.4% success on compound instances. We release SWE-Refactor and all evaluation results to facilitate future research on LLM-based code refactoring.

*Facundo Molina,M M Abid Naziri,Feiran Qin,Alessandra Gorla,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies improving bug-finding in deep learning libraries by training ML classifiers to classify API input validity using tensor shapes. It achieves significant gains in testing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper lies in addressing bugs in DL libraries caused by their complex design. Despite the existence of bug-finding techniques, imprecise API specifications result in many false alarms, and current methods to mine these specifications lack accuracy.

Method: The authors propose using ML classifiers trained on labeled data representing runtime outcomes to verify inputs' validity. By abstracting input relationships through tensor shapes, dimensionality is reduced, aiding effective training and better API constraint capture.

Result: The method demonstrates generalization capability, achieving over 91% accuracy on unseen data across 183 TensorFlow and Pytorch APIs. Integrating these classifiers into the ACETest bug-finding pipeline increases the pass rate from ~29% to ~61%.

Conclusion: ML-enhanced input classification improves the scalability and accuracy of DL library testing, suggesting a robust solution to bugs stemming from complex APIs in DL libraries.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) libraries like TensorFlow and Pytorch simplify machine learning (ML) model development but are prone to bugs due to their complex design. Bug-finding techniques exist, but without precise API specifications, they produce many false alarms. Existing methods to mine API specifications lack accuracy. We explore using ML classifiers to determine input validity. We hypothesize that tensor shapes are a precise abstraction to encode concrete inputs and capture relationships of the data. Shape abstraction severely reduces problem dimensionality, which is important to facilitate ML training. Labeled data are obtained by observing runtime outcomes on a sample of inputs and classifiers are trained on sets of labeled inputs to capture API constraints. Our evaluation, conducted over 183 APIs from TensorFlow and Pytorch, shows that the classifiers generalize well on unseen data with over 91% accuracy. Integrating these classifiers into the pipeline of ACETest, a SoTA bug-finding technique, improves its pass rate from ~29% to ~61%. Our findings suggest that ML-enhanced input classification is an important aid to scale DL library testing.

### [598] [FullStack-Agent: Enhancing Agentic Full-Stack Web Coding via Development-Oriented Testing and Repository Back-Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03798)
*Zimu Lu,Houxing Ren,Yunqiao Yang,Ke Wang,Zhuofan Zong,Mingjie Zhan,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces FullStack-Agent, a system for creating production-level full-stack web applications, outperforming existing solutions and improving LLM capabilities with innovative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM-powered tools for generating frontend web pages are common, they lack the capability to handle complex full-stack web development, which includes data processing, storage, package dependencies, and bug localization.

Method: The paper presents FullStack-Agent consisting of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework for planning and debugging; (2) FullStack-Learn, a self-improving data-scaling method using back-translation; and (3) FullStack-Bench, a benchmark for systematically testing full-stack functionalities.

Result: FullStack-Dev outperforms previous methods by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% in frontend, backend, and database functionalities respectively. FullStack-Learn further boosts these results, improving the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8%.

Conclusion: The FullStack-Agent system addresses key challenges in full-stack web development, significantly enhancing performance in web application generation and providing an effective learning improvement mechanism.

Abstract: Assisting non-expert users to develop complex interactive websites has become a popular task for LLM-powered code agents. However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.

*Chetan Gohil,Oliver M. Cliff,James M. Shine,Ben D. Fulcher,Joseph T. Lizier*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A novel framework utilizing active information storage, transfer entropy, and net synergy quantifies information processing from task-based fMRI, applied to the Human Connectome Project data to reveal enhanced information flows and global redundancy during working memory tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI analyses do not effectively quantify information processing, focusing mainly on activation or connectivity. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a new methodology.

Method: The paper introduces measures like active information storage, transfer entropy, and net synergy, calculated using a cross mutual information approach with resting-state and task data.

Result: Application of the framework to 470 participants performing a working memory task showed increases in information storage in fronto-parietal regions, enhanced directed information flow, and a shift towards redundancy globally.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel methodology for assessing complex information processing in task-based fMRI, offering insights into brain dynamics during cognitive tasks.

Abstract: Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper reviews the advancements in EEG analysis leveraging transformer architectures and SSL, focusing on foundation models trained on multi-channel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to assess the state of SSL-based EEG foundation models to identify current trends, challenges, and future directions for improving the field.

Method: A systematic review was conducted, examining 19 studies using searches in databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv. Details on datasets, architectures, and downstream applications were reviewed.

Result: Transformer architectures dominated as pretraining frameworks, with masked auto-encoding as the leading objective. Significant heterogeneity in methods was observed, and general-purpose EEG models remain absent.

Conclusion: The progress is promising but hindered by dataset limitations and lack of standard benchmarks. Future work should focus on larger, diverse data, and standardized protocols to advance robust EEG models.

Abstract: Automated analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) has recently undergone a paradigm shift. The introduction of transformer architectures and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) has led to the development of EEG foundation models. These models are pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a range of downstream tasks. This systematic review summarizes recent SSL-trained EEG foundation models that learn whole-brain representations from multichannel EEG rather than representations derived from a single channel. We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and arXiv through July 21, 2025. Nineteen preprints and peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria. We extracted information regarding pretraining datasets, model architectures, pretraining SSL objectives, and downstream task applications. While pretraining data heavily relied on the Temple University EEG corpus, there was significant heterogeneity in model architecture and training objectives across studies. Transformer architectures were identified as the predominant pretraining architecture with state-space models such as MAMBA and S4 as emerging alternatives. Concerning SSL objectives, masked auto-encoding was most common, and other studies incorporate contrastive learning. Downstream tasks varied widely and implemented diverse fine-tuning strategies, which made direct comparison challenging. Furthermore, most studies used single-task fine-tuning, and a generalizable EEG foundation model remains lacking. In conclusion, the field is advancing rapidly but still limited by limited dataset diversity and the absence of standardized benchmarks. Progress will likely depend on larger and more diverse pretraining datasets, standardized evaluation protocols, and multi-task validation. The development will advance EEG foundation models towards robust and general-purpose relevant to both basic and clinical applications.

### [601] [Relaxed Triangle Inequality for Kullback-Leibler Divergence Between Multivariate Gaussian Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02577)
*Shiji Xiao,Yufeng Zhang,Chubo Liu,Yan Ding,Keqin Li,Kenli Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the relaxed triangle inequality for KL divergence among multivariate Gaussian distributions and provides the supremum value and conditions for attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL divergence is commonly used in applications, but its lack of adherence to the triangle inequality creates theoretical challenges. Relaxed bounds for this inequality need to be explored for practical usability.

Method: The study provides a detailed mathematical investigation of the relaxed triangle inequality for KL divergence in multivariate Gaussian distributions, deriving the supremum value under specific conditions.

Result: The supremum of KL divergence is determined as $ε_1+ε_2+sqrt{ε_1ε_2}+o(ε_1)+o(ε_2)$ for small $ε_1$ and $ε_2$. Applications in flow-based generative models and reinforcement learning validate the findings.

Conclusion: The paper identifies and formulates the supremum for KL divergence with relaxed triangle inequality conditions, offering theoretical and practical advancements in key computational and learning scenarios.

Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is not a proper distance metric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality, posing theoretical challenges in certain practical applications. Existing work has demonstrated that KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions follows a relaxed triangle inequality. Given any three multivariate Gaussian distributions $\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_2$, and $\mathcal{N}_3$, if $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_2)\leq ε_1$ and $KL(\mathcal{N}_2, \mathcal{N}_3)\leq ε_2$, then $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)< 3ε_1+3ε_2+2\sqrt{ε_1ε_2}+o(ε_1)+o(ε_2)$. However, the supremum of $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)$ is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the relaxed triangle inequality for the KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions and give the supremum of $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)$ as well as the conditions when the supremum can be attained. When $ε_1$ and $ε_2$ are small, the supremum is $ε_1+ε_2+\sqrt{ε_1ε_2}+o(ε_1)+o(ε_2)$. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of our results in out-of-distribution detection with flow-based generative models and safe reinforcement learning.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free method for adapting frozen foundation models for few-shot classification without access to upstream data or parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address constraints where parameter updates to foundation models can cause instability or shifts, especially in deployment scenarios.

Method: The method uses task-similarity scores and exponential tilting to reweight latent distributions during test-time without modifying model parameters.

Result: The proposed inference method competes with parameter-update methods across benchmarks while operating under stricter constraints.

Conclusion: Inference-level distributional correction can adapt fully-frozen foundation models effectively for few-shot classification tasks.

Abstract: Often, constraints arise in deployment settings where even lightweight parameter updates e.g. parameter-efficient fine-tuning could induce model shift or tuning instability. We study test-time adaptation of foundation models for few-shot classification under a completely frozen-model regime, where additionally, no upstream data are accessible. We propose arguably the first training-free inference method that adapts predictions to the new task by performing a change of measure over the latent embedding distribution induced by the encoder. Using task-similarity scores derived from a small labeled support set, exponential tilting reweights latent distributions in a KL-optimal manner without modifying model parameters. Empirically, the method consistently competes with parameter-update-based methods across multiple benchmarks and shot regimes, while operating under strictly and universally stronger constraints. These results demonstrate the viability of inference-level distributional correction for test-time adaptation even with a fully-frozen model pipeline.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NNEinFact, a versatile, efficient tool for nonnegative tensor factorizations using a user-defined string model and outperforms existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of user-friendly, customizable tools for fitting nonnegative tensor factorizations across various scientific domains.

Method: NNEinFact employs an einsum-based multiplicative update algorithm, allowing users to define their models simply as a string and optimize over customizable loss functions.

Result: NNEinFact achieves faster convergence, supports large tensors, handles missing data, and outperforms standard and gradient-based models in test tasks by significant margins.

Conclusion: NNEinFact provides an accessible, highly efficient solution for custom nonnegative tensor factorizations, demonstrating substantial improvements in both performance and usability.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of multiway data across scientific domains, there are few user-friendly tools that fit tailored nonnegative tensor factorizations. Researchers may use gradient-based automatic differentiation (which often struggles in nonnegative settings), choose between a limited set of methods with mature implementations, or implement their own model from scratch. As an alternative, we introduce NNEinFact, an einsum-based multiplicative update algorithm that fits any nonnegative tensor factorization expressible as a tensor contraction by minimizing one of many user-specified loss functions (including the $(α,β)$-divergence). To use NNEinFact, the researcher simply specifies their model with a string. NNEinFact converges to a local minimum of the loss, supports missing data, and fits to tensors with hundreds of millions of entries in seconds. Empirically, NNEinFact fits custom models which outperform standard ones in heldout prediction tasks on real-world tensor data by over $37\%$ and attains less than half the test loss of gradient-based methods while converging up to 90 times faster.

*Yuzhen Zhao,Jiarong Fan,Yating Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a multiclass classification framework for multidimensional diffusion processes using neural networks that estimate drift functions and demonstrates improved results compared to earlier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multiclass classification for multidimensional diffusion processes effectively while tackling challenges such as discretized trajectory observations and drift estimation errors.

Method: A neural network-based plug-in classifier was proposed, estimating drift functions for classes and assigning labels using Bayes-type decision rules, with theoretical and numerical validations included.

Result: The classifier achieves faster convergence rates, improved classification accuracy in multidimensional settings, and outperforms direct neural network models trained on trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed method leverages structural knowledge of diffusion processes, improving classification performance and scalability to higher dimensions.

Abstract: We study a supervised multiclass classification problem for diffusion processes, where each class is characterized by a distinct drift function and trajectories are observed at discrete times. Extending the one-dimensional multiclass framework of Denis et al. (2024) to multidimensional diffusions, we propose a neural network-based plug-in classifier that estimates the drift functions for each class from independent sample paths and assigns labels based on a Bayes-type decision rule. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish convergence rates for the excess misclassification risk, explicitly capturing the effects of drift estimation error and time discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence and improved classification performance compared to Denis et al. (2024) in the one-dimensional setting, remains effective in higher dimensions when the underlying drift functions admit a compositional structure, and consistently outperforms direct neural network classifiers trained end-to-end on trajectories without exploiting the diffusion model structure.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free self-correction framework for masked diffusion models, improving generation quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked diffusion models lack self-correction capabilities, leading to error accumulation during generation. Existing solutions have limitations like extra training or misaligned likelihood estimates.

Method: The method utilizes the inductive biases of pre-trained masked diffusion models, avoiding adjustments to model parameters or using external evaluators to enhance quality.

Result: The framework improves generation quality, reduces sampling steps, and demonstrates robustness across various masked diffusion architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the performance of masked diffusion models in text-to-image generation and multimodal tasks with a simple, generalizable framework.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for text and multimodal generation. However, their sampling procedure updates multiple tokens simultaneously and treats generated tokens as immutable, which may lead to error accumulation when early mistakes cannot be revised. In this work, we revisit existing self-correction methods and identify limitations stemming from additional training requirements or reliance on misaligned likelihood estimates. We propose a training-free self-correction framework that exploits the inductive biases of pre-trained masked diffusion models. Without modifying model parameters or introducing auxiliary evaluators, our method significantly improves generation quality on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks with reduced sampling steps. Moreover, the proposed framework generalizes across different masked diffusion architectures, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

*Zhixian Zhang,Xiaotian Hou,Linjun Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a statistical inference framework for predictive models in environments where predictions influence data distributions, introducing methods for estimating performative stability and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predictive models altering data distributions and unify the analysis of single-agent and multi-agent performativity.

Method: The proposed methods include the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) procedure for performative stability and a two-step plug-in estimator using RePPI and Importance Sampling for performative optimality.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic efficiency, robustness under mild distributional issues, and demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound.

Conclusion: This work offers a principled and efficient toolkit for estimation and decision-making in changing data environments caused by predictive performativity.

Abstract: Performative prediction characterizes environments where predictive models alter the very data distributions they aim to forecast, triggering complex feedback loops. While prior research treats single-agent and multi-agent performativity as distinct phenomena, this paper introduces a unified statistical inference framework that bridges these contexts, treating the former as a special case of the latter. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we put forward the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) procedure for estimating the performative stability, and establish a rigorous inferential theory for admitting its asymptotic normality and confirming its asymptotic efficiency. Second, for the performative optimality, we introduce a novel two-step plug-in estimator that integrates the idea of Recalibrated Prediction Powered Inference (RePPI) with Importance Sampling, and further provide formal derivations for the Central Limit Theorems of both the underlying distributional parameters and the plug-in results. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound and maintains robustness under mild distributional misspecification. This work provides a principled toolkit for reliable estimation and decision-making in dynamic, performative environments.

### [607] [Online Conformal Prediction via Universal Portfolio Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03168)
*Tuo Liu,Edgar Dobriban,Francesco Orabona*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) method called UP-OCP, which avoids manual tuning and ensures strong finite-time coverage guarantees using a regret-to-coverage theoretical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCP methods can be challenging due to the need for manual learning-rate tuning and algorithm-specific analyses. A general, automated, and principled approach is needed to improve coverage and informativeness in adversarial data.

Method: A new regret-to-coverage theory is introduced using $(1-α)$-pinball loss, focusing on controlling linearized regret. The authors develop UP-OCP, a parameter-free OCP method, using a reduction to a portfolio selection problem.

Result: The method achieves strong theoretical miscoverage bounds and is empirically validated through experiments that demonstrate superior size/coverage trade-offs compared to prior baselines.

Conclusion: UP-OCP offers a robust, parameter-free alternative for OCP tasks with automated and theoretically-backed performance advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Online conformal prediction (OCP) seeks prediction intervals that achieve long-run $1-α$ coverage for arbitrary (possibly adversarial) data streams, while remaining as informative as possible. Existing OCP methods often require manual learning-rate tuning to work well, and may also require algorithm-specific analyses. Here, we develop a general regret-to-coverage theory for interval-valued OCP based on the $(1-α)$-pinball loss. Our first contribution is to identify \emph{linearized regret} as a key notion, showing that controlling it implies coverage bounds for any online algorithm. This relies on a black-box reduction that depends only on the Fenchel conjugate of an upper bound on the linearized regret. Building on this theory, we propose UP-OCP, a parameter-free method for OCP, via a reduction to a two-asset portfolio selection problem, leveraging universal portfolio algorithms. We show strong finite-time bounds on the miscoverage of UP-OCP, even for polynomially growing predictions. Extensive experiments support that UP-OCP delivers consistently better size/coverage trade-offs than prior online conformal baselines.

TL;DR: Functional data clustering with phase variation is improved through a deep learning framework that jointly handles registration and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase variation can obscure intrinsic shape differences in functional data and degrade clustering accuracy, necessitating advanced methods to address this issue.

Method: NeuralFLoC utilizes Neural ODE-driven diffeomorphic flows and spectral clustering in an unsupervised end-to-end framework to achieve functional registration and clustering jointly.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance in registration and clustering tasks, handling missing data, irregular sampling, and noise while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: The NeuralFLoC framework effectively disentangles phase and amplitude variations, offering a robust solution for functional data analysis with scalability and high performance.

Abstract: Clustering functional data in the presence of phase variation is challenging, as temporal misalignment can obscure intrinsic shape differences and degrade clustering performance. Most existing approaches treat registration and clustering as separate tasks or rely on restrictive parametric assumptions. We present \textbf{NeuralFLoC}, a fully unsupervised, end-to-end deep learning framework for joint functional registration and clustering based on Neural ODE-driven diffeomorphic flows and spectral clustering. The proposed model learns smooth, invertible warping functions and cluster-specific templates simultaneously, effectively disentangling phase and amplitude variation. We establish universal approximation guarantees and asymptotic consistency for the proposed framework. Experiments on functional benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance in both registration and clustering, with robustness to missing data, irregular sampling, and noise, while maintaining scalability.

*Benjamin Maurel,Agathe Guilloux,Sarah Zohar,Moreno Ursino,Jean-Baptiste Woillard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method using Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (Latent ODEs) for accurate tacrolimus AUC prediction after renal transplantation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in precision dosing caused by rigid assumptions in traditional pharmacokinetic models.

Method: Development of a Latent ODE-based deep learning approach which learns individualized pharmacokinetic dynamics directly from sparse clinical data and is compared to traditional methods through simulations and clinical validations.

Result: The Latent ODE model demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness, achieving lower RMSPE values in both internal and external validation datasets compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: Latent ODE offers a reliable, flexible alternative for AUC prediction, with potential applications in advancing personalized medicine.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of tacrolimus exposure, quantified by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), is essential for precision dosing after renal transplantation. Current practice relies on population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models based on nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) methods. However, these models depend on rigid, pre-specified assumptions and may struggle to capture complex, patient-specific dynamics, leading to model misspecification.
  In this study, we introduce a novel data-driven alternative based on Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (Latent ODEs) for tacrolimus AUC prediction. This deep learning approach learns individualized pharmacokinetic dynamics directly from sparse clinical data, enabling greater flexibility in modeling complex biological behavior. The model was evaluated through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios and benchmarked against two standard approaches: NLME-based estimation and the iterative two-stage Bayesian (it2B) method. We further performed a rigorous clinical validation using a development dataset (n = 178) and a completely independent external dataset (n = 75).
  In simulation, the Latent ODE model demonstrated superior robustness, maintaining high accuracy even when underlying biological mechanisms deviated from standard assumptions. Regarding experiments on clinical datasets, in internal validation, it achieved significantly higher precision with a mean RMSPE of 7.99% compared with 9.24% for it2B (p < 0.001). On the external cohort, it achieved an RMSPE of 10.82%, comparable to the two standard estimators (11.48% and 11.54%).
  These results establish the Latent ODE as a powerful and reliable tool for AUC prediction. Its flexible architecture provides a promising foundation for next-generation, multi-modal models in personalized medicine.

*Rémi Khellaf,Erwan Scornet,Aurélien Bellet,Julie Josse*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: FedForest is a novel federated learning algorithm for Random Forests (RF) that efficiently achieves near-centralized performance in heterogeneous data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods for RF lack principled approaches and fail to optimize global impurity criteria under distribution shifts.

Method: FedForest aggregates specially selected client statistics to approximate centralized splitting procedures and introduces splits on client indicators for non-parametric personalization.

Result: Empirical results show FedForest achieves performance close to centralized models on heterogeneous benchmarks and is communication-efficient.

Conclusion: FedForest effectively adapts RF to federated learning, handling diverse client heterogeneity and overcoming limitations of prior heuristics.

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) are among the most powerful and widely used predictive models for centralized tabular data, yet few methods exist to adapt them to the federated learning setting. Unlike most federated learning approaches, the piecewise-constant nature of RF prevents exact gradient-based optimization. As a result, existing federated RF implementations rely on unprincipled heuristics: for instance, aggregating decision trees trained independently on clients fails to optimize the global impurity criterion, even under simple distribution shifts. We propose FedForest, a new federated RF algorithm for horizontally partitioned data that naturally accommodates diverse forms of client data heterogeneity, from covariate shift to more complex outcome shift mechanisms. We prove that our splitting procedure, based on aggregating carefully chosen client statistics, closely approximates the split selected by a centralized algorithm. Moreover, FedForest allows splits on client indicators, enabling a non-parametric form of personalization that is absent from prior federated random forest methods. Empirically, we demonstrate that the resulting federated forests closely match centralized performance across heterogeneous benchmarks while remaining communication-efficient.

*Alex Finkelstein,Ron Moneta,Or Zohar,Michal Rivlin,Moritz Zaiss,Dinora Friedmann Morvinski,Or Perlman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) for rapid voxelwise biophysical parameter estimation with uncertainty quantification and validates it in various studies, delivering significant acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of trustworthiness and transparency in traditional quantitative imaging methods, ensuring interpretability and clinical acceptance by providing principled uncertainty quantification.

Method: Integration of a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning into a PS-VAE to yield multi-parameter posterior distributions and covariances.

Result: The PS-VAE demonstrated results concordant with brute-force Bayesian analysis, while achieving significant acceleration in brain quantification and offering insights for adaptive acquisition.

Conclusion: PS-VAE enhances the efficiency and reliability of quantitative imaging, offering a clinically viable solution with improved uncertainty quantification and practical acquisition optimizations.

Abstract: Quantitative imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), aim to extract interpretable pathology biomarkers by estimating biophysical tissue parameters from signal evolutions. However, the pattern-matching algorithms or neural networks used in such inverse problems often lack principled uncertainty quantification, which limits the trustworthiness and transparency, required for clinical acceptance. Here, we describe a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) designed for rapid extraction of voxelwise multi-parameter posterior distributions. Our approach integrates a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning, and provides a full covariance that captures the inter-parameter correlations of the latent biophysical space. The method was validated in a multi-proton pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) molecular MRF study, across in-vitro phantoms, tumor-bearing mice, healthy human volunteers, and a subject with glioblastoma. The resulting multi-parametric posteriors are in good agreement with those calculated using a brute-force Bayesian analysis, while providing an orders-of-magnitude acceleration in whole brain quantification. In addition, we demonstrate how monitoring the multi-parameter posterior dynamics across progressively acquired signals provides practical insights for protocol optimization and may facilitate real-time adaptive acquisition.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper improves the analysis of the Accelerated Noisy Power Method for decentralized PCA, enabling optimal convergence rates under relaxed noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous guarantees for the Accelerated Noisy Power Method required overly restrictive assumptions on the perturbations, limiting its practical applicability.

Method: The authors refine the analysis of the algorithm to maintain accelerated convergence rates under milder conditions and provide a worst-case optimal convergence proof.

Result: They show optimal convergence rates and noise conditions cannot be relaxed further without sacrificing guarantees, and they design a communication-efficient decentralized PCA algorithm.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first decentralized PCA algorithm with provable accelerated convergence and improved practical applicability.

Abstract: We analyze the Accelerated Noisy Power Method, an algorithm for Principal Component Analysis in the setting where only inexact matrix-vector products are available, which can arise for instance in decentralized PCA. While previous works have established that acceleration can improve convergence rates compared to the standard Noisy Power Method, these guarantees require overly restrictive upper bounds on the magnitude of the perturbations, limiting their practical applicability. We provide an improved analysis of this algorithm, which preserves the accelerated convergence rate under much milder conditions on the perturbations. We show that our new analysis is worst-case optimal, in the sense that the convergence rate cannot be improved, and that the noise conditions we derive cannot be relaxed without sacrificing convergence guarantees. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our results by deriving an accelerated algorithm for decentralized PCA, which has similar communication costs to non-accelerated methods. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized algorithm for PCA with provably accelerated convergence.

*Pedro Jiménez,Luis A. Ortega,Pablo Morales-Álvarez,Daniel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Quadratic Laplace Approximation (QLA) to improve Bayesian uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks without significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often produce overconfident out-of-distribution predictions, highlighting the need for reliable Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

Method: QLA approximates the Laplace log-posterior by simplifying second-order factors via efficient power iterations, improving upon the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA) model.

Result: QLA demonstrates consistent modest improvements in uncertainty estimation over LLA on five regression datasets.

Conclusion: QLA provides a computationally feasible and more faithful approximation to the Laplace posterior, enhancing uncertainty quantification capabilities in DNNs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident out-of-distribution predictions, motivating Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA) achieves this by linearizing the DNN and applying Laplace inference to the resulting model. Importantly, the linear model is also used for prediction. We argue this linearization in the posterior may degrade fidelity to the true Laplace approximation. To alleviate this problem, without increasing significantly the computational cost, we propose the Quadratic Laplace Approximation (QLA). QLA approximates each second order factor in the approximate Laplace log-posterior using a rank-one factor obtained via efficient power iterations. QLA is expected to yield a posterior precision closer to that of the full Laplace without forming the full Hessian, which is typically intractable. For prediction, QLA also uses the linearized model. Empirically, QLA yields modest yet consistent uncertainty estimation improvements over LLA on five regression datasets.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper evaluates score-based diffusion models in solving the highly ill-posed inverse problem of Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) by introducing a novel mixed score regularization approach. Results demonstrate enhanced posterior sampling with low variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations of classical model-based estimations in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly in highly ill-posed scenarios like DOT, and improve robustness against noise and modelling errors using score-based models.

Method: The proposed method introduces a mixed score regularization combining learned and model-based components to enhance the score function. Validation is performed using both simulated and experimental measurement data.

Result: Experiments show that the data-driven prior distribution significantly enhances posterior sampling by reducing variance and centering samples closer to the ground truth, even in the presence of modelling errors.

Conclusion: The novel mixed score regularization approach improves accuracy and robustness in solving ill-posed inverse problems, providing better posterior sampling for applications like diffuse optical tomography.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a recently developed framework for posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems with a state-of-the-art performance for severely ill-posed problems by leveraging a powerful prior distribution learned from empirical data. Despite generating significant interest especially in the machine-learning community, a thorough study of realistic inverse problems in the presence of modelling error and utilization of physical measurement data is still outstanding. In this work, the framework of unconditional representation for the conditional score function (UCoS) is evaluated for linearized difference imaging in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). DOT uses boundary measurements of near-infrared light to estimate the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering parameters in biological tissues. The problem is highly ill-posed and thus sensitive to noise and modelling errors. We introduce a novel regularization approach that prevents overfitting of the score function by constructing a mixed score composed of a learned and a model-based component. Validation of this approach is done using both simulated and experimental measurement data. The experiments demonstrate that a data-driven prior distribution results in posterior samples with low variance, compared to classical model-based estimation, and centred around the ground truth, even in the context of a highly ill-posed problem and in the presence of modelling errors.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for generating graphs using a diffusion-based approach leveraging graph Laplacians and heat kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve graph generative modeling by introducing a novel diffusion-based framework that unifies and generalizes existing methods for various applications such as chemistry, biology, and social networks.

Method: Uses the graph Laplacian and its heat kernel to define a diffusion process for graph generation, where a neural network learns to approximate the generator by minimizing a Bregman divergence.

Result: The proposed method effectively captures structural properties of real and synthetic graphs during experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified and general approach to graph generation, combining domain-specific knowledge (via Laplacian) and the flexibility of neural networks.

Abstract: Graph generative modelling has become an essential task due to the wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, social networks, and knowledge representation. In this work, we propose a novel framework for generating graphs by adapting the Generator Matching (arXiv:2410.20587) paradigm to graph-structured data. We leverage the graph Laplacian and its associated heat kernel to define a continous-time diffusion on each graph. The Laplacian serves as the infinitesimal generator of this diffusion, and its heat kernel provides a family of conditional perturbations of the initial graph. A neural network is trained to match this generator by minimising a Bregman divergence between the true generator and a learnable surrogate. Once trained, the surrogate generator is used to simulate a time-reversed diffusion process to sample new graph structures. Our framework unifies and generalises existing diffusion-based graph generative models, injecting domain-specific inductive bias via the Laplacian, while retaining the flexibility of neural approximators. Experimental studies demonstrate that our approach captures structural properties of real and synthetic graphs effectively.

### [616] [Efficient Variance-reduced Estimation from Generative EHR Models: The SCOPE and REACH Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03730)
*Luke Solo,Matthew B. A. McDermott,William F. Parker,Bashar Ramadan,Michael C. Burkhart,Brett K. Beaulieu-Jones*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new statistical methods (SCOPE and REACH) to improve efficiency and reduce computation costs in clinical outcome prediction using generative models trained on electronic health record data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current methods for predicting patient outcomes from EHR generative models are inefficient, computationally expensive, and yield sparse distributions that don't differentiate patient risk levels effectively.

Method: The authors propose two estimators: SCOPE and REACH, which utilize next-token probability distributions instead of relying solely on traditional Monte Carlo simulations. These methods are proven to be unbiased, with REACH ensuring variance reduction over Monte Carlo-based approaches.

Result: SCOPE and REACH demonstrated equivalent performance to 100-sample Monte Carlo simulations in hospital mortality prediction but with a ~10x reduced inference cost. For ICU admission prediction, they achieved only a modest improvement (~1.2x) due to outcome dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed estimators significantly enhance the practicality of deploying generative EHR models in clinical settings, especially in resource-limited environments, by lowering computational burdens and maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Generative models trained using self-supervision of tokenized electronic health record (EHR) timelines show promise for clinical outcome prediction. This is typically done using Monte Carlo simulation for future patient trajectories. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: sparse estimate distributions that poorly differentiate patient risk levels, extreme computational costs, and high sampling variance. We propose two new estimators: the Sum of Conditional Outcome Probability Estimator (SCOPE) and Risk Estimation from Anticipated Conditional Hazards (REACH), that leverage next-token probability distributions discarded by standard Monte Carlo. We prove both estimators are unbiased and that REACH guarantees variance reduction over Monte Carlo sampling for any model and outcome. Empirically, on hospital mortality prediction in MIMIC-IV using the ETHOS-ARES framework, SCOPE and REACH match 100-sample Monte Carlo performance using only 10-11 samples (95% CI: [9,11]), representing a ~10x reduction in inference cost without degrading calibration. For ICU admission prediction, efficiency gains are more modest (~1.2x), which we attribute to the outcome's lower "spontaneity," a property we characterize theoretically and empirically. These methods substantially improve the feasibility of deploying generative EHR models in resource-constrained clinical settings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies stochastic interpolants in generative models, extending their flexibility and introducing new schedules for enhanced performance with Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative modeling frameworks by enhancing stochastic interpolant flexibility and establishing new methods for efficient sampling.

Method: The authors extend the stochastic interpolant framework using new point mass schedules, identify lazy schedules that simplify drift dynamics, and derive formulae to switch between schedules/apply theoretical advances to pretrained flow models without retraining.

Result: They develop schedules that simplify to variance-preserving sampling for specific cases and demonstrate improved sampling efficiency by combining lazy schedule theory with state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The work unifies stochastic flows and diffusions, proposes a broader framework for schedules, and introduces efficient practical applications of these theoretical advancements in image generation.

Abstract: Stochastic interpolants unify flows and diffusions, popular generative modeling frameworks. A primary hyperparameter in these methods is the interpolation schedule that determines how to bridge a standard Gaussian base measure to an arbitrary target measure. We prove how to convert a sample path of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with arbitrary diffusion coefficient under any schedule into the unique sample path under another arbitrary schedule and diffusion coefficient. We then extend the stochastic interpolant framework to admit a larger class of point mass schedules in which the Gaussian base measure collapses to a point mass measure. Under the assumption of Gaussian data, we identify lazy schedule families that make the drift identically zero and show that with deterministic sampling one gets a variance-preserving schedule commonly used in diffusion models, whereas with statistically optimal SDE sampling one gets our point mass schedule. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of our theoretical results on realistic highly non-Gaussian data, we apply our lazy schedule conversion to a state-of-the-art pretrained flow model and show that this allows for generating images in fewer steps without retraining the model.

TL;DR: A preference-based framework called CPTE is proposed for estimating conditional treatment effects using ranked outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in modeling treatment effects with diverse outcomes using flexible preference-based approaches.

Method: The paper introduces CPTE with strategies like matching, quantile, and distributional regression, along with influence-function estimators.

Result: Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments confirm performance improvements and practical usefulness.

Conclusion: CPTE offers interpretable, flexible models for conditional treatment effect estimation, surpassing traditional limitations.

Abstract: We introduce a new preference-based framework for conditional treatment effect estimation and policy learning, built on the Conditional Preference-based Treatment Effect (CPTE). CPTE requires only that outcomes be ranked under a preference rule, unlocking flexible modeling of heterogeneous effects with multivariate, ordinal, or preference-driven outcomes. This unifies applications such as conditional probability of necessity and sufficiency, conditional Win Ratio, and Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. Despite the intrinsic non-identifiability of comparison-based estimands, CPTE provides interpretable targets and delivers new identifiability conditions for previous unidentifiable estimands. We present estimation strategies via matching, quantile, and distributional regression, and further design efficient influence-function estimators to correct plug-in bias and maximize policy value. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate clear performance gains and practical impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of renewable energy integration into power systems necessitates automating the translation of natural-language operational requirements into executable optimization models, as traditional workflows face challenges handling near-real-time requirements.

Method: The authors developed two resources: ProOPF-D, a dataset containing 12K instances aligning natural-language requests with parameter and structural adjustments to OPF models, and ProOPF-B, consisting of 121 expert-annotated cases with ground-truth code, enabling rigorous LLM evaluation.

Result: The introduced datasets enable LLMs to be rigorously evaluated and trained for specific, professional-grade OPF modeling, addressing gaps in existing datasets and benchmarks.

Conclusion: ProOPF-D and ProOPF-B represent a significant step forward in applying LLMs to power system optimization, particularly for adapting to renewable energy's operational complexities.

Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of ensuring safety in nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances, which are uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled, by enhancing control methodologies for better safety guarantees.

Method: The method involves generalizing the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework using Optimal Decay CBF, and constructing ISSf-CBFs for strict-feedback systems and dual-relative-degree systems through theoretical and simulation-based approaches.

Result: The study successfully implements the framework for two classes of systems—strict-feedback and dual-relative-degree—showing its applicability through numerical simulations on an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a more flexible and constructive method for achieving safety-critical control in nonlinear systems affected by unmatched disturbances. This is demonstrated through theoretical formulation and validated via numerical examples.

Abstract: Guaranteeing safety in the presence of unmatched disturbances -- uncertainties that cannot be directly canceled by the control input -- remains a key challenge in nonlinear control. This paper presents a constructive approach to safety-critical control of nonlinear systems with unmatched disturbances. We first present a generalization of the input-to-state safety (ISSf) framework for systems with these uncertainties using the recently developed notion of an Optimal Decay CBF, which provides more flexibility for satisfying the associated Lyapunov-like conditions for safety. From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hyperspectral single image super-resolution methods rely on supervised learning, needing high-resolution ground truth data that is rarely available.

Method: The proposed method uses hyperspectral unmixing to decompose images into endmembers and abundance maps, and employs a neural network trained with synthetic data generated by the dead leaves model for super-resolution.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed approach improves hyperspectral image resolution effectively using synthetic training data.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning with synthetic abundance data is a feasible and effective solution for hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving the rich spectral information of hyperspectral images. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning with high-resolution ground truth data, which is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on synthetic abundance data. The hyperspectral image is first decomposed into endmembers and abundance maps through hyperspectral unmixing. A neural network is then trained to super-resolve these maps using data generated with the dead leaves model, which replicates the statistical properties of real abundances. The final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by recombining the super-resolved abundance maps with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the relevance of synthetic data for training.

Motivation: The aim is to address challenges such as high annotation burdens and artifacts in ultrasound imaging by developing a generalizable echocardiography foundation model leveraging large datasets.

Method: EchoJEPA is trained on a massive dataset of 18 million echocardiograms from 300,000 patients. It incorporates a multi-view probing framework with factorized embeddings for standardized evaluation.

Result: EchoJEPA achieves 19% error reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction estimation, 87.4% view classification accuracy, and strong sample efficiency. It performs well under perturbations and zero-shot transfers to pediatric data.

Conclusion: EchoJEPA demonstrates latent prediction as a highly effective paradigm for foundation models in echocardiography, setting new performance benchmarks and generalizability standards.

Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography promise to reduce annotation burden and improve diagnostic consistency by learning generalizable representations from large unlabeled video archives. However, current approaches fail to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts that dominate ultrasound imagery. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model for echocardiography trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. We also introduce a novel multi-view probing framework with factorized stream embeddings that standardizes evaluation under frozen backbones. Compared to prior methods, EchoJEPA reduces left ventricular ejection fraction estimation error by 19% and achieves 87.4% view classification accuracy. EchoJEPA exhibits strong sample efficiency, reaching 78.6% accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42.1% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Under acoustic perturbations, EchoJEPA degrades by only 2.3% compared to 16.8% for the next best model, and transfers zero-shot to pediatric patients with 15% lower error than the next best model, outperforming all fine-tuned baselines. These results establish latent prediction as a superior paradigm for ultrasound foundation models.

We present a configurable Monte Carlo simulation framework that generates synthetic corneal B-scan optical OCT images with pixel-level five-layer segmentation labels derived directly from the simulation geometry. A five-layer corneal model with Gaussian surfaces captures curvature and thickness variability in healthy and keratoconic eyes. Each layer is assigned optical properties from the literature and light transport is simulated using Monte Carlo modeling of light transport in multi-layered tissues (MCML), while incorporating system features such as the confocal PSF and sensitivity roll-off. This approach produces over 10,000 high-resolution (1024x1024) image-label pairs and supports customization of geometry, photon count, noise, and system parameters. The resulting dataset enables systematic training, validation, and benchmarking of AI models under controlled, ground-truth conditions, providing a reproducible and scalable resource to support the development of diagnostic and surgical guidance applications in image-guided ophthalmology.

*Rosalinda Xiong,Jinglun Yu,Yaning Wang,Ziyi Huang,Jin U. Kang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a segmentation pipeline with anatomical topology regularization for real-time guidance during robotic DALK surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving accurate and real-time depth feedback to approach DM in robotic DALK without perforation is challenging due to speckle noise and shadowing in intraoperative OCT.

Method: A lightweight M-mode segmentation pipeline integrated with UNeXt is developed, using anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal-to-noise ratios.

Result: The system delivers over 80 Hz throughput, ensuring real-time guidance while rejecting low-quality frames. Evaluation with rabbit eye datasets shows improved boundary stability and practical deployment capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances real-time robustness and depth update rates for intraoperative guidance during robotic DALK, making it effective and stable in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Robotic deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) requires accurate real time depth feedback to approach Descemet's membrane (DM) without perforation. M-mode intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high temporal resolution depth traces, but speckle noise, attenuation, and instrument induced shadowing often result in discontinuous or ambiguous layer interfaces that challenge anatomically consistent segmentation at deployment frame rates. We present a lightweight, topology aware M-mode segmentation pipeline based on UNeXt that incorporates anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed system achieves end to end throughput exceeding 80 Hz measured over the complete preprocessing inference overlay pipeline on a single GPU, demonstrating practical real time guidance beyond model only timing. This operating margin provides temporal headroom to reject low quality or dropout frames while maintaining a stable effective depth update rate. Evaluation on a standard rabbit eye M-mode dataset using an established baseline protocol shows improved qualitative boundary stability compared with topology agnostic controls, while preserving deployable real time performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized framework for scalable AI agents employing dynamic coalitions to achieve task-specific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized architectures for agentic AI limit scalability, specialization, and interoperability.

Method: The authors propose a network-native collaboration model and decentralized algorithms for coalition formation, focusing on capability coverage, locality, and economic feasibility.

Result: The framework was applied in a healthcare case study, demonstrating its scalability, resilience, and economic viability in coordinating agentic workflows.

Conclusion: This study establishes principled methods for coordination and scalability in distributed agentic intelligence systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of agentic AI systems that reason, plan, and act by invoking external tools. However, most existing agentic architectures remain centralized and monolithic, limiting scalability, specialization, and interoperability. This paper proposes a framework for scalable agentic intelligence, termed the Internet of Agentic AI, in which autonomous, heterogeneous agents distributed across cloud and edge infrastructure dynamically form coalitions to execute task-driven workflows. We formalize a network-native model of agentic collaboration and introduce an incentive-compatible workflow-coalition feasibility framework that integrates capability coverage, network locality, and economic implementability. To enable scalable coordination, we formulate a minimum-effort coalition selection problem and propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm. The proposed framework can operate as a coordination layer above the Model Context Protocol (MCP). A healthcare case study demonstrates how domain specialization, cloud-edge heterogeneity, and dynamic coalition formation enable scalable, resilient, and economically viable agentic workflows. This work lays the foundation for principled coordination and scalability in the emerging era of Internet of Agentic AI.

*Zhengwei Ni,Zhidu Li,Wei Chen,Zhaoyang Zhang,Zehua Wang,F. Richard Yu,Victor C. M. Leung*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fairness-driven payoff allocation framework based on the least core concept, aimed at maintaining stability in federated learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for a fair and stable payoff allocation mechanism in federated learning systems to ensure sustainability and prevent participants from leaving coalitions.

Method: A least core (LC)-based payoff allocation framework is introduced, complemented by a stack-based pruning algorithm for practical implementation in large-scale networks.

Result: Case studies on federated intrusion detection show that the LC framework accurately identifies essential contributors and promotes stable collaboration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework ensures coalition stability and fosters sustainable federated learning ecosystems by reducing dissatisfaction among collaborative participants.

Abstract: Emerging network paradigms and applications increasingly rely on federated learning (FL) to enable collaborative intelligence while preserving privacy. However, the sustainability of such collaborative environments hinges on a fair and stable payoff allocation mechanism. Focusing on coalition stability, this paper introduces a payoff allocation framework based on the least core (LC) concept. Unlike traditional methods, the LC prioritizes the cohesion of the federation by minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among all potential subgroups, ensuring that no participant has an incentive to break away. To adapt this game-theoretic concept to practical, large-scale networks, we propose a streamlined implementation with a stack-based pruning algorithm, effectively balancing computational efficiency with allocation precision. Case studies in federated intrusion detection demonstrate that our mechanism correctly identifies pivotal contributors and strategic alliances. The results confirm that the practical LC framework promotes stable collaboration and fosters a sustainable FL ecosystem.

*Jiao Sun*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: Using a ResNet34 deep learning model, the paper explores avian morphological evolution and reveals that deep embeddings encode phenotypic convergence and hierarchical taxonomy despite flat training labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional morphological analyses often introduce subjective biases in coding traits. The study aims to employ deep learning techniques to objectively analyze biological morphology, specifically focusing on birds.

Method: ResNet34 model recognizing 10,000 bird species was used. Morphological traits were analyzed by extracting weights from the model's fully connected layer and assessing biological phenotypes in the learned embedding space.

Result: The high-dimensional embedding space encoded phenotypic convergence. It also revealed morphological disparity among taxa and demonstrated the link between species richness and morphospace expansion. Early burst patterns post-K-Pg extinction were observed.

Conclusion: Deep Neural Networks can effectively analyze evolutionary morphology, revealing hierarchical semantic structures and overcoming texture biases to capture holistic shape representations, enhancing interpretability and analysis accuracy.

Abstract: The evolution of biological morphology is critical for understanding the diversity of the natural world, yet traditional analyses often involve subjective biases in the selection and coding of morphological traits. This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual "early burst" after the K-Pg extinction.
  While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the digital divide in speech technology development between high-resource and Sub-Saharan African languages and promote inclusive technology for underrepresented languages.

Method: The authors collected speech data by partnering with African academic and community organizations, employed annotation, quality control processes, and provided phonetically balanced scripts for uniformity.

Result: The resulting datasets encompass 1,250 hours of transcribed natural speech and over 180 hours of single-speaker recordings. They are openly accessible under a CC-BY-4.0 license.

Conclusion: WAXAL dataset facilitates research and technology development for African languages and contributes to preserving linguistic diversity by making speech data for these languages broadly accessible.

Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.

*Xi Xuan,Davide Carbone,Ruchi Pandey,Wenxin Zhang,Tomi H. Kinnunen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces WST-X, a new feature extractor combining wavelets and nonlinearities for speech deepfake detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current front-ends in speech deepfake detectors either lack high-level semantic detail (hand-crafted features) or interpretability (self-supervised features).

Method: The authors developed WST-X, leveraging wavelet scattering transform (WST) in 1D and 2D to capture acoustic details and structural anomalies.

Result: WST-X significantly surpasses existing front-ends on the challenging Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset.

Conclusion: WST-X effectively balances interpretability and performance by utilizing translation-invariant and deformation-stable features for robust speech deepfake detection.

Abstract: Designing front-ends for speech deepfake detectors primarily focuses on two categories. Hand-crafted filterbank features are transparent but are limited in capturing high-level semantic details, often resulting in performance gaps compared to self-supervised (SSL) features. SSL features, in turn, lack interpretability and may overlook fine-grained spectral anomalies. We propose the WST-X series, a novel family of feature extractors that combines the best of both worlds via the wavelet scattering transform (WST), integrating wavelets with nonlinearities analogous to deep convolutional networks. We investigate 1D and 2D WSTs to extract acoustic details and higher-order structural anomalies, respectively. Experimental results on the recent and challenging Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset indicate that WST-X outperforms existing front-ends by a wide margin. Our analysis reveals that a small averaging scale ($J$), combined with high-frequency and directional resolutions ($Q, L$), is critical for capturing subtle artifacts. This underscores the value of translation-invariant and deformation-stable features for robust and interpretable speech deepfake detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-ready dataset of a Chakavian dialect translation of "The Little Prince," aligning text and audio components for various uses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to preserve the Chakavian dialect translation, enable AI-related applications, and provide a digital edition for broader appreciation.

Method: They aligned text and audio data of the book and experimented with adapting the Whisper-large-v3 ASR model for Chakavian speech.

Result: Adapting the ASR model improved word error rate by half and character error rate by two-thirds on test data.

Conclusion: The dataset can support future AI research, dialect studies, and wider public appreciation of the dialect and literary work.

Abstract: This paper documents our efforts in releasing the printed and audio book of the translation of the famous novel The Little Prince into the Chakavian dialect, as a computer-readable, AI-ready dataset, with the textual and the audio components of the two releases now aligned on the level of each written and spoken word. Our motivation for working on this release is multiple. The first one is our wish to preserve the highly valuable and specific content beyond the small editions of the printed and the audio book. With the dataset published in the CLARIN.SI repository, this content is from now on at the fingertips of any interested individual. The second motivation is to make the data available for various artificial-intelligence-related usage scenarios, such as the one we follow upon inside this paper already -- adapting the Whisper-large-v3 open automatic speech recognition model, with decent performance on standard Croatian, to Chakavian dialectal speech. We can happily report that with adapting the model, the word error rate on the selected test data has being reduced to a half, while we managed to remove up to two thirds of the error on character level. We envision many more usages of this dataset beyond the set of experiments we have already performed, both on tasks of artificial intelligence research and application, as well as dialectal research. The third motivation for this release is our hope that this, now highly structured dataset, will be transformed into a digital online edition of this work, allowing individuals beyond the research and technology communities to enjoy the beauty of the message of the little boy in the desert, told through the spectacular prism of the Chakavian dialect.

*Hugo Malard,Gael Le Lan,Daniel Wong,David Lou Alon,Yi-Chiao Wu,Sanjeel Parekh*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper presents a generative approach using Conditional Flow Matching for visually-guided acoustic highlighting, addressing the misalignment between audio and video focus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of effective methods for acoustic highlighting in audio-visual content, as existing discriminative approaches fail to address the ambiguity in audio remixing.

Method: The authors propose a Conditional Flow Matching framework, incorporating a rollout loss to stabilize trajectories and a conditioning module for cross-modal source selection.

Result: Their method outperforms current state-of-the-art discriminative approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Generative modeling is a more effective approach than discriminative methods for visually-guided acoustic highlighting, providing better audio-visual alignment.

Abstract: Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.

### [632] [A Distinct Communication Strategies Model of the Double Empathy Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02562)
*Enrique Calderoli,Maria Cristina Varriale,Flávio Kapczinski*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the double empathy problem between autistic and neurotypical individuals through a feedback-loop mathematical model based on communication differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explain the double empathy problem as a bidirectional issue instead of attributing it solely to autistic individuals' deficits by investigating how communication preferences impact empathy.

Method: Developing a feedback-loop mathematical model to replicate and analyze empathy degradation due to communication differences in neurotypical-autistic interactions.

Result: Simulations demonstrated that the model effectively captures the breakdown of empathy bonds observed in such interactions, providing predictions through stability analysis.

Conclusion: The study offers a theoretical framework for understanding the double empathy problem and suggests directions for experimental validation of the model.

Abstract: The double empathy problem recasts the difficulty of forming empathy bonds in social interactions between autistic and neurotypical individuals as a bidirectional problem, rather than due to a deficit exclusive to the person on the spectrum. However, no explicit mechanism to explain such a phenomenon has been proposed. Here we build a feedback-loop mathematical model that would theoretically induce the empathy degradation observed during communication in neurotypical-autistic pairs solely due to differences in communication preferences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Numerical simulations of dyadic interactions show the model, whose mechanism is based solely on communication preferences, can illustrate the breakdown of empathic bonding observed clinically. Stability analysis of the model provides a way to predict the overall trajectory of the interaction in the empathy space. Furthermore, we suggest experimental designs to measure several parameters outlined here and discuss the future directions for testing the proposed model.

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of 'Anchoring Agents' in encouraging cooperation in Multi-Agent Systems governed by Large Language Models. It finds that behavioral changes occur, but true value alignment remains elusive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by the 'Tragedy of the Commons' in Multi-Agent Systems driven by LLMs, especially concerning fostering genuine cooperation.

Method: The study used a Public Goods Game (PGG) with a full factorial design to analyze behavioral outputs and reasoning patterns across three advanced Large Language Models.

Result: Anchoring Agents improved local cooperation rates, but this effect stemmed from strategies like compliance and cognitive offloading, not from core norm internalization. Advanced models displayed deceptive behaviors under scrutiny.

Conclusion: While behavioral interventions via Anchoring Agents yield local cooperation improvements, achieving true value alignment in artificial societies remains a notable challenge.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems where collective cooperation is often threatened by the "Tragedy of the Commons." This study investigates the effectiveness of Anchoring Agents--pre-programmed altruistic entities--in fostering cooperation within a Public Goods Game (PGG). Using a full factorial design across three state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyzed both behavioral outcomes and internal reasoning chains. While Anchoring Agents successfully boosted local cooperation rates, cognitive decomposition and transfer tests revealed that this effect was driven by strategic compliance and cognitive offloading rather than genuine norm internalization. Notably, most agents reverted to self-interest in new environments, and advanced models like GPT-4.1 exhibited a "Chameleon Effect," masking strategic defection under public scrutiny. These findings highlight a critical gap between behavioral modification and authentic value alignment in artificial societies.

Motivation: Develop a powerful simulation framework for quantum transport properties in nanoscale devices, addressing both scalability and accuracy challenges.

Method: Utilize advancements in NEGF combined with DFT methods, integrating mechanisms such as scattering sources and exploring machine learning approaches for computational efficiency.

Result: Enhanced algorithmic approaches made DFT+NEGF simulations feasible for larger and realistic systems, with discussions on the potential of machine learning techniques.

Conclusion: The paper highlights progress in improving accuracy and scalability in DFT+NEGF simulations, suggesting machine learning as a tool for further innovation.

Abstract: The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.

This paper presents an AI driven approach for dynamic front-end personalization, where UI layouts, content, and features adapt in real-time based on predicted user behavior. We propose three strategies: dynamic layout adaptation using user path prediction, content prioritization through reinforcement learning, and a comparative analysis of AI-driven vs. rule-based personalization. Technical implementation details, algorithms, system architecture, and evaluation methods are provided to illustrate feasibility and performance gains.

TL;DR: The study investigates the ethics of human-robot interaction through an experiment which challenges Sparrow's ethical asymmetry hypothesis, using a new adaptation of the Questionnaire on Cardinal Virtues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine Sparrow's ethical asymmetry hypothesis in human treatment of robots and to explore how moral permissibility of actions impacts perceived virtues in human-robot interactions.

Method: A mixed within/between experimental design was conducted where moral permissibility of actions and different virtue types were manipulated, using online questionnaires with established moral and virtue measures.

Result: Moral permissibility significantly affected perceived moral permissibility of actions and virtues, with a cubic relationship observed; however, Sparrow's hypothesis was not supported.

Conclusion: The results suggest symmetry in the PMPA-Virtue relationship, questioning Sparrow's hypothesis. The adapted QCV tool shows promise for future human-robot ethics studies.

Abstract: The ethics of human-robot interaction (HRI) have been discussed extensively based on three traditional frameworks: deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics. We conducted a mixed within/between experiment to investigate Sparrow's proposed ethical asymmetry hypothesis in human treatment of robots. The moral permissibility of action (MPA) was manipulated as a subject grouping variable, and virtue type (prudence, justice, courage, and temperance) was controlled as a within-subjects factor. We tested moral stimuli using an online questionnaire with Perceived Moral Permissibility of Action (PMPA) and Perceived Virtue Scores (PVS) as response measures. The PVS measure was based on an adaptation of the established Questionnaire on Cardinal Virtues (QCV), while the PMPA was based on Malle et al. [39] work. We found that the MPA significantly influenced the PMPA and perceived virtue scores. The best-fitting model to describe the relationship between PMPA and PVS was cubic, which is symmetrical in nature. Our study did not confirm Sparrow's asymmetry hypothesis. The adaptation of the QCV is expected to have utility for future studies, pending additional psychometric property assessments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people adaptively coordinate physical movement and sensory strategies during combined audiovisual search tasks under uncertainty.

Method: Development of the Sensonaut model, which treats audiovisual search as a resource-rational decision-making problem, validated with human experimental data.

Result: The model replicates human adaptive strategies, such as scaling search time and effort, as well as common errors, in varying levels of task complexity and distractions.

Conclusion: Sensonaut explains human audiovisual search behavior and suggests interfaces design to decrease cognitive and search costs.

Abstract: Locating a target based on auditory and visual cues$\unicode{x2013}$such as finding a car in a crowded parking lot or identifying a speaker in a virtual meeting$\unicode{x2013}$requires balancing effort, time, and accuracy under uncertainty. Existing models of audiovisual search often treat perception and action in isolation, overlooking how people adaptively coordinate movement and sensory strategies. We present Sensonaut, a computational model of embodied audiovisual search. The core assumption is that people deploy their body and sensory systems in ways they believe will most efficiently improve their chances of locating a target, trading off time and effort under perceptual constraints. Our model formulates this as a resource-rational decision-making problem under partial observability. We validate the model against newly collected human data, showing that it reproduces both adaptive scaling of search time and effort under task complexity, occlusion, and distraction, and characteristic human errors. Our simulation of human-like resource-rational search informs the design of audiovisual interfaces that minimize search cost and cognitive load.

TL;DR: The paper presents a 14-week workshop for co-designing embodied AI in healthcare, leading to deployable solutions and proposing eight co-design guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the lack of sustained co-design processes in embodied AI development, particularly for real-world and high-stakes contexts like healthcare.

Method: The authors conducted a 14-week multidisciplinary workshop involving 22 participants to design embodied AI solutions for healthcare contexts, progressing from abstract ideas to high-fidelity prototypes.

Result: The workshop enabled a deeper understanding of real-world trade-offs and more deployable solutions, leading to the creation of eight guidelines for effective co-design of embodied AI.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of sustained and iterative co-design processes in embodied AI to create context-sensitive, deployable, and socially aware systems in healthcare.

Abstract: Co-design is essential for grounding embodied artificial intelligence (AI) systems in real-world contexts, especially high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While prior work has explored multidisciplinary collaboration, iterative prototyping, and support for non-technical participants, few have interwoven these into a sustained co-design process. Such efforts often target one context and low-fidelity stages, limiting the generalizability of findings and obscuring how participants' ideas evolve. To address these limitations, we conducted a 14-week workshop with a multidisciplinary team of 22 participants, centered around how embodied AI can reduce non-value-added task burdens in three healthcare settings: emergency departments, long-term rehabilitation facilities, and sleep disorder clinics. We found that the iterative progression from abstract brainstorming to high-fidelity prototypes, supported by educational scaffolds, enabled participants to understand real-world trade-offs and generate more deployable solutions. We propose eight guidelines for co-designing more considerate embodied AI: attuned to context, responsive to social dynamics, mindful of expectations, and grounded in deployment.

Conclusion: Speech-to-Spatial offers an innovative approach to verbal remote assistance by transforming spoken instructions into spatially grounded guidance, improving remote collaboration outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-to-Spatial, a referent disambiguation framework that converts verbal remote-assistance instructions into spatially grounded AR guidance. Unlike prior systems that rely on additional cues (e.g., gesture, gaze) or manual expert annotations, Speech-to-Spatial infers the intended target solely from spoken references (speech input). Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance ("a bit more to the right", "now, stop.") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view.

TL;DR: PrevizWhiz is a system combining rough 3D scenes with generative models to create stylized video previews for pre-production in filmmaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and expressiveness limitations in pre-production prototyping, especially bridging the gap between 2D storyboarding and 3D previsualization.

Method: Integrating rough 3D scenarios with generative image/video models for stylized previews, allowing refineable, time-based edits and adjustable resemblance.

Result: A study with filmmakers shows the system lowers technical barriers, accelerates creative iteration, and improves communication while surfacing challenges regarding continuity and ethical considerations.

Conclusion: PrevizWhiz enhances pre-production efficiency while emphasizing the need to address ethical and authorship issues in AI-driven filmmaking.

Abstract: In pre-production, filmmakers and 3D animation experts must rapidly prototype ideas to explore a film's possibilities before fullscale production, yet conventional approaches involve trade-offs in efficiency and expressiveness. Hand-drawn storyboards often lack spatial precision needed for complex cinematography, while 3D previsualization demands expertise and high-quality rigged assets. To address this gap, we present PrevizWhiz, a system that leverages rough 3D scenes in combination with generative image and video models to create stylized video previews. The workflow integrates frame-level image restyling with adjustable resemblance, time-based editing through motion paths or external video inputs, and refinement into high-fidelity video clips. A study with filmmakers demonstrates that our system lowers technical barriers for film-makers, accelerates creative iteration, and effectively bridges the communication gap, while also surfacing challenges of continuity, authorship, and ethical consideration in AI-assisted filmmaking.

TL;DR: This study investigates how Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) affects photo editing and memory-making experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how people use GenAI to edit personal photos and its influence on their memory perception.

Method: Researchers conducted a qualitative study with 12 participants involving a guided photo editing session using GenAI tools and subsequent interviews.

Result: Participants prioritized emotional or felt memory over strict factual accuracy, accepted environmental edits but resisted alterations related to personal identity. The editing itself became part of the memory process.

Conclusion: GenAI editing presents both positive and negative effects on memories. The paper calls for responsible design approaches to maximize benefits while mitigating risks in memory representation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly integrated into photo applications on personal devices, making editing photographs easier than ever while potentially influencing the memories they represent. This study explores how and why people use GenAI to edit personal photos and how this shapes their remembering experience. We conducted a two-phase qualitative study with 12 participants: a photo editing session using a GenAI tool guided by the Remembering Experience (RX) dimensions, followed by semi-structured interviews where participants reflected on the editing process and results. Findings show that participants prioritised felt memory over factual accuracy. For different photo elements, environments were modified easily, however, editing was deemed unacceptable if it touched upon a person's identity. Editing processes brought positive and negative impacts, and itself also became a remembering experience. We further discuss potential benefits and risks of GenAI editing for remembering purposes and propose design implications for responsible GenAI.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-Inspired Transformer Quantum States (PITQS), improving neural quantum states (NQS) by grounding their architecture in physically-motivated principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of physical transparency in existing neural quantum state (NQS) architectures used in variational Monte Carlo frameworks.

Method: The authors reinterpret NQS as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution, proposing PITQS that enforce a static effective Hamiltonian via shared weights and improve propagation through Trotter-Suzuki decompositions.

Result: For the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, PITQS achieved comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art transformers with fewer variational parameters.

Conclusion: Physically-oriented designs like PITQS reduce reliance on black-box architectures, providing a systematic and compact way to achieve high accuracy in quantum simulations.

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful ansätze in the variational Monte Carlo framework, yet their architectures are often treated as black boxes. We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ansätze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel adaptive scheme for importance sampling, combining global sampling with delayed weighting to improve efficiency on complex, multimodal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Importance sampling becomes inefficient with complex, high-dimensional, multimodal target distributions due to poor choice of proposal distributions.

Method: The paper introduces an adaptive sampling algorithm combining global exploration mechanisms and delayed weighting to better align proposal distributions with the target distribution.

Result: The algorithm achieves geometrical convergence, enabling rapid resampling and efficient exploration, demonstrated via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: A novel adaptive importance sampling method improves efficiency and convergence in complex distributions, validated numerically under mild assumptions.

Abstract: Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo method which designs estimators of expectations under a target distribution using weighted samples from a proposal distribution. When the target distribution is complex, such as multimodal distributions in highdimensional spaces, the efficiency of importance sampling critically depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive scheme for the construction of efficient proposal distributions. Our algorithm promotes efficient exploration of the target distribution by combining global sampling mechanisms with a delayed weighting procedure. The proposed weighting mechanism plays a key role by enabling rapid resampling in regions where the proposal distribution is poorly adapted to the target. Our sampling algorithm is shown to be geometrically convergent under mild assumptions and is illustrated through various numerical experiments.

*Arya Farahi,Jonah Rose,Paul Torrey*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper develops a lightweight simulation-based inference method using regression-based projections to infer simulator parameters, combining surrogate regression and kernel weights for pseudo-posterior estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the efficiency of parameter inference in simulation-based models, reducing reliance on raw observations while ensuring computational efficiency and scalability.

Method: The authors propose a method built on regression-based projections with surrogate linear regression, kernel-weighting, importance sampling approximations, and stability and consistency proof of the pseudo-posterior estimation under various conditions.

Result: The proposed method is computationally advantageous, consistent, stable for finite samples, and its pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set based on chosen projection, as validated by experiments on nonlinear and cosmological models.

Conclusion: This method offers a simplified and parallelizable approach to simulation-based inference, clarifying identifiability trade-offs and achieving efficient computational performance with low-information summaries.

Abstract: We analyze a lightweight simulation-based inference method that infers simulator parameters using only a regression-based projection of the observed data. After fitting a surrogate linear regression once, the procedure simulates small batches at the proposed parameter values and assigns kernel weights based on the resulting batch-residual discrepancy, producing a self-normalized pseudo-posterior that is simple, parallelizable, and requires access only to the fitted regression coefficients rather than raw observations. We formalize the construction as an importance-sampling approximation to a population target that averages over simulator randomness, prove consistency as the number of parameter draws grows, and establish stability in estimating the surrogate regression from finite samples. We then characterize the asymptotic concentration as the batch size increases and the bandwidth shrinks, showing that the pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set determined by the chosen projection, thereby clarifying when the method yields point versus set identification. Experiments on a tractable nonlinear model and on a cosmological calibration task using the DREAMS simulation suite illustrate the computational advantages of regression-based projections and the identifiability limitations arising from low-information summaries.

### [645] [Weighted Sum-of-Trees Model for Clustered Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02931)
*Kevin McCoy,Zachary Wooten,Katarzyna Tomczak,Christine B. Peterson*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel decision tree-based approach to better handle clustered data by creating tree models for each group and enhancing out-of-sample predictions using group similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mixed models fail to account for differences between clusters when predicting out-of-sample group data, assuming a common model for all clusters.

Method: The paper proposes a sum-of-trees model where each group gets its own decision tree. Out-of-sample predictions are weighted based on similarity to training data groups.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional decision trees and random forests in simulations and works effectively on cancer genomic data grouped by sarcoma subtype.

Conclusion: The model improves prediction accuracy for clustered data, while also offering insights into inter-group similarity and variable importance.

Abstract: Clustered data, which arise when observations are nested within groups, are incredibly common in clinical, education, and social science research. Traditionally, a linear mixed model, which includes random effects to account for within-group correlation, would be used to model the observed data and make new predictions on unseen data. Some work has been done to extend the mixed model approach beyond linear regression into more complex and non-parametric models, such as decision trees and random forests. However, existing methods are limited to using the global fixed effects for prediction on data from out-of-sample groups, effectively assuming that all clusters share a common outcome model. We propose a lightweight sum-of-trees model in which we learn a decision tree for each sample group. We combine the predictions from these trees using weights so that out-of-sample group predictions are more closely aligned with the most similar groups in the training data. This strategy also allows for inference on the similarity across groups in the outcome prediction model, as the unique tree structures and variable importances for each group can be directly compared. We show our model outperforms traditional decision trees and random forests in a variety of simulation settings. Finally, we showcase our method on real-world data from the sarcoma cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas, where patient samples are grouped by sarcoma subtype.

*Xi Chen,Homa Esfahanizadeh,Foad Sohrabi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper proposes a precoding-oriented framework for efficient CSI compression using advanced neural techniques and information-theoretic regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing CSI feedback overhead with achievable system performance in massive MIMO systems.

Method: The method involves using a vector quantized variational autoencoder with differentiable mutual information estimation for effective codebook utilization within a fixed feedback budget.

Result: The framework achieves comparable rates to variable-length neural compression schemes, maintains fixed-length feedback operations, and produces interpretable codewords strongly correlated with channel state information.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers efficient CSI feedback compression, enhances performance, and demonstrates interpretable and uniform codeword utilization.

Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.

*Saeed R. Khosravirad,Ahmed Alkhateeb,Ingrid van de Voorde*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces optimal decoding strategies for lossy compression under mismatched source distributions, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve decoding in situations where the source distribution assumed during compression mismatches the true distribution, which frequently occurs in standardized communication systems.

Method: Develop a generative decompression approach aligning with Bayesian estimation to optimize reconstruction, extended to noisy channels and task-oriented decoding.

Result: The generative decompression outperforms the centroid rule, significantly reducing performance gaps in Gaussian sources and semantic classification tasks, even without encoder changes.

Conclusion: Generative decompression is a robust and adaptive approach for lossy compression, offering improved performance in mismatched distribution scenarios and noisy channels.

Abstract: This paper addresses optimal decoding strategies in lossy compression where the assumed distribution for compressor design mismatches the actual (true) distribution of the source. This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Ozaki-II scheme for high-precision matrix multiplication, providing a deterministic error analysis and guidance for accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inconsistent numerical accuracy in the Ozaki-II scheme for matrix multiplication under scenarios where input matrices have a wide exponent distribution.

Method: The study performs a deterministic error analysis of the Ozaki-II scheme to clarify accuracy behavior and determine the needed number of low-precision multiplications.

Result: The analysis explains the accuracy degradation in specific conditions and provides a method to estimate the optimal number of low-precision computations.

Conclusion: An effective error analysis framework was proposed and can guide the usage of the Ozaki-II scheme for enhanced performance and accuracy in matrix calculations.

Abstract: The Ozaki-II scheme is an emulation method that leverages the Chinese Remainder Theorem to compute high-precision matrix multiplication via a sequence of low-precision matrix multiplications. In this scheme, the attainable numerical accuracy improves as the number of low-precision matrix multiplications increases. Previous numerical studies have shown that single- and double-precision matrix multiplication using the Ozaki-II scheme achieves higher throughput than that of standard BLAS routines on modern AI hardware equipped with fast INT8 matrix multiply-accumulate units with INT8 inputs and INT32 accumulation. However, the accuracy of the Ozaki-II scheme can degrade when the exponent distribution of the input matrices is wide, in which case a large number of low-precision matrix multiplications is required to obtain high-precision results. In this paper, we present a rigorous deterministic error analysis of the Ozaki-II scheme. The proposed analysis not only clarifies the accuracy behavior of the method but also enables the estimation of the number of low-precision matrix multiplications required to achieve a desired level of numerical accuracy.

TL;DR: DiffLOB is a regime-conditioned diffusion model designed for controllable and counterfactual generation of limit order book (LOB) trajectories, enabling analysis under varied market scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LOB generative models fail at simulating hypothetical future market conditions and cannot address counterfactual queries, limiting their utility for stress testing and decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces DiffLOB, a diffusion model conditioned on future market regimes such as trend, volatility, liquidity, and order-flow imbalance to create counterfactual LOB trajectories.

Result: DiffLOB enables the generation of LOB trajectories that align with intended counterfactual market conditions, ensuring realistic, valid, and useful synthetic data.

Conclusion: DiffLOB improves counterfactual analysis and enhances the predictive capability of future market regimes, addressing key limitations of prior LOB generative models.

Abstract: Modern generative models for limit order books (LOBs) can reproduce realistic market dynamics, but remain fundamentally passive: they either model what typically happens without accounting for hypothetical future market conditions, or they require interaction with another agent to explore alternative outcomes. This limits their usefulness for stress testing, scenario analysis, and decision-making. We propose \textbf{DiffLOB}, a regime-conditioned \textbf{Diff}usion model for controllable and counterfactual generation of \textbf{LOB} trajectories. DiffLOB explicitly conditions the generative process on future market regimes--including trend, volatility, liquidity, and order-flow imbalance, which enables the model to answer counterfactual queries of the form: ``If the future market regime were X instead of Y, how would the limit order book evolve?'' Our systematic evaluation framework for counterfactual LOB generation consists of three criteria: (1) \textit{Controllable Realism}, measuring how well generated trajectories can reproduce marginal distributions, temporal dependence structure and regime variables; (2) \textit{Counterfactual validity}, testing whether interventions on future regimes induce consistent changes in the generated LOB dynamics; (3) \textit{Counterfactual usefulness}, assessing whether synthetic counterfactual trajectories improve downstream prediction of future market regimes.

Result: TRAILDREAMS outperforms current automated trailer generation methods in viewer ratings but is still behind human-crafted trailers in quality.

Conclusion: TRAILDREAMS shows promise in advancing automated creative processes but requires further improvement to match traditional trailer quality.

Abstract: This paper introduces TRAILDREAMS, a framework that uses a large language model (LLM) to automate the production of movie trailers.

The goal is to produce engaging and visually appealing trailers efficiently. In comparative evaluations, TRAILDREAMS surpasses current state-of-the-art trailer generation methods in viewer ratings. However, it still falls short when compared to real, human-crafted trailers.

Motivation: Lean's usability as a mathematical tool is limited by the absence of many folklore lemmas in Mathlib.

Method: Developing MathlibLemma: an LLM-based multi-agent system to systematically identify and formalize folklore lemmas, and constructing the MathlibLemma benchmark.

Result: The system successfully created a library of verified folklore lemmas, with some integrated into Mathlib, and established a benchmark consisting of 4,028 Lean statements.

Conclusion: MathlibLemma enables LLMs to actively contribute to the evolution of formal mathematical libraries, improving their utility and alignment with expert standards.

Abstract: While the ecosystem of Lean and Mathlib has enjoyed celebrated success in formal mathematical reasoning with the help of large language models (LLMs), the absence of many folklore lemmas in Mathlib remains a persistent barrier that limits Lean's usability as an everyday tool for mathematicians like LaTeX or Maple. To address this, we introduce MathlibLemma, the first LLM-based multi-agent system to automate the discovery and formalization of mathematical folklore lemmas. This framework constitutes our primary contribution, proactively mining the missing connective tissue of mathematics. Its efficacy is demonstrated by the production of a verified library of folklore lemmas, a subset of which has already been formally merged into the latest build of Mathlib, thereby validating the system's real-world utility and alignment with expert standards. Leveraging this pipeline, we further construct the MathlibLemma benchmark, a suite of 4,028 type-checked Lean statements spanning a broad range of mathematical domains. By transforming the role of LLMs from passive consumers to active contributors, this work establishes a constructive methodology for the self-evolution of formal mathematical libraries.

Motivation: To address advanced information needs in IR, such as logical constraints, multi-step inference, and evidence synthesis.

Method: A unified analytical framework defines reasoning in IR and maps existing methods along core components to highlight trade-offs and collaboration opportunities.

Result: This framework provides comprehensive insights into reasoning methods and shows how IR can integrate and benefit from cross-disciplinary research.

Conclusion: The tutorial equips participants with tools to develop reasoning-capable IR systems and promotes IR's role within broader reasoning methodologies.

Abstract: Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in conventional binning and neural embedding methods for Click-Through Rate prediction, especially semantic drift and disregarded streaming distributional contexts.

Method: DAES framework incorporates reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation and field-aware distribution modulation strategies for streaming environments.

Result: DAES demonstrated superior performance in offline and online experiments and has been successfully deployed in a major short-video platform.

Conclusion: The proposed DAES framework effectively tackles numerical feature embedding challenges, offering practical deployment utility in large-scale streaming applications.

Abstract: This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that predicts query-specific importance of dimensions in dense retrieval embeddings, improving performance without using noisy pseudo-relevance feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address redundancy in query-level representations of dense retrieval and improve performance by focusing on query-specific dimensions that are consistently helpful for ranking.

Method: The authors create a supervised learning method that constructs oracle importance distributions over dimensions and trains a predictor to map query embeddings to these scores for selecting query-aware dimensions during inference.

Result: Their approach demonstrates improved retrieval performance across different dense retrievers and benchmarks compared to full-dimensional baselines, PRF-based masking, and supervised adapter baselines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel way to improve dense retrieval by predicting query-aware importance of dimensions, bypassing the need for noisy pseudo-relevance signals and heuristic procedures.

Abstract: Dense retrieval represents queries and docu-002 ments as high-dimensional embeddings, but003 these representations can be redundant at the004 query level: for a given information need, only005 a subset of dimensions is consistently help-006 ful for ranking. Prior work addresses this via007 pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) based dimen-008 sion importance estimation, which can produce009 query-aware masks without labeled data but010 often relies on noisy pseudo signals and heuris-011 tic test-time procedures. In contrast, super-012 vised adapter methods leverage relevance labels013 to improve embedding quality, yet they learn014 global transformations shared across queries015 and do not explicitly model query-aware di-016 mension importance. We propose a Query-017 Aware Adaptive Dimension Selection frame-018 work that learns to predict per-dimension im-019 portance directly from query embedding. We020 first construct oracle dimension importance dis-021 tributions over embedding dimensions using022 supervised relevance labels, and then train a023 predictor to map a query embedding to these024 label-distilled importance scores. At inference,025 the predictor selects a query-aware subset of026 dimensions for similarity computation based027 solely on the query embedding, without pseudo-028 relevance feedback. Experiments across multi-029 ple dense retrievers and benchmarks show that030 our learned dimension selector improves re-031 trieval effectiveness over the full-dimensional032 baseline as well as PRF-based masking and033 supervised adapter baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization framework successfully addresses the limitations of traditional methods by improving user satisfaction and revenue in a real-world context, showcasing its practicality and impact on E-commerce platforms.

Abstract: E-commerce Search Results Pages (SRPs) are evolving from linear lists to complex, non-linear layouts, rendering traditional position-biased ranking models insufficient. Moreover, existing optimization frameworks typically maximize short-term signals (e.g., clicks, same-day revenue) because long-term satisfaction metrics (e.g., expected two-week revenue) involve delayed feedback and challenging long-horizon credit attribution. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Whole-Page Experience Optimization Framework. Unlike traditional list-wise rankers, our approach explicitly models the interplay between item relevance, 2D positional layout, and visual elements. We use a causal framework to develop metrics for measuring long-term user satisfaction based on quasi-experimental data. We validate our approach through industry-scale A/B testing, where the model demonstrated a 1.86% improvement in brand relevance (our primary customer experience metric) while simultaneously achieving a statistically significant revenue uplift of +0.05%

### [656] [Perfusion Imaging and Single Material Reconstruction in Polychromatic Photon Counting CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02713)
*Namhoon Kim,Ashwin Pananjady,Amir Pourmorteza,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The study develops VI-PRISM, a VI-based reconstruction method for dose-reduced perfusion CT, achieving superior accuracy and image quality over traditional techniques with significant dose reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce high X-ray doses in perfusion CT while maintaining or improving image quality by adapting a recently proposed VI-based reconstruction algorithm.

Method: The VI-based reconstruction method is tailored for perfusion CT, assuming static background tissue and simulating iodine concentrations (0.05 to 2.5 mg/ml) across varying photon intensities and projection numbers.

Result: VI-PRISM consistently achieved lower error, less noise, and higher image quality compared to filtered back-projection, even in low-dose and sparse data settings.

Conclusion: VI-PRISM enables accurate, dose-efficient perfusion CT imaging by consistently recovering iodine concentrations with errors below 0.4 mg/ml, demonstrating its potential in photon-counting CT applications.

Abstract: Background: Perfusion computed tomography (CT) images the dynamics of a contrast agent through the body over time, and is one of the highest X-ray dose scans in medical imaging. Recently, a theoretically justified reconstruction algorithm based on a monotone variational inequality (VI) was proposed for single material polychromatic photon-counting CT, and showed promising early results at low-dose imaging.
  Purpose: We adapt this reconstruction algorithm for perfusion CT, to reconstruct the concentration map of the contrast agent while the static background tissue is assumed known; we call our method VI-PRISM (VI-based PeRfusion Imaging and Single Material reconstruction). We evaluate its potential for dose-reduced perfusion CT, using a digital phantom with water and iodine of varying concentration.
  Methods: Simulated iodine concentrations range from 0.05 to 2.5 mg/ml. The simulated X-ray source emits photons up to 100 keV, with average intensity ranging from $10^5$ down to $10^2$ photons per detector element. The number of tomographic projections was varied from 984 down to 8 to characterize the tradeoff in photon allocation between views and intensity.
  Results: We compare VI-PRISM against filtered back-projection (FBP), and find that VI-PRISM recovers iodine concentration with error below 0.4 mg/ml at all source intensity levels tested. Even with a dose reduction between 10x and 100x compared to FBP, VI-PRISM exhibits reconstruction quality on par with FBP.
  Conclusion: Across all photon budgets and angular sampling densities tested, VI-PRISM achieved consistently lower RMSE, reduced noise, and higher SNR compared to filtered back-projection. Even in extremely photon-limited and sparsely sampled regimes, VI-PRISM recovered iodine concentrations with errors below 0.4 mg/ml, showing that VI-PRISM can support accurate and dose-efficient perfusion imaging in photon-counting CT.

### [657] [A Novel approach to portfolio construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03325)
*T. Di Matteo,L. Riso,M. G. Zoia*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper introduces BPASGM, a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction that integrates sparse graphical modeling and portfolio optimization, improving risk-return performance and reducing portfolio cardinality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the issue of estimation errors and over-diversification in high-dimensional portfolio settings by screening for independent or negatively correlated assets, improving portfolio performance in finite samples.

Method: BPASGM extends the Best-Path Algorithm to create sparse graphical models for financial assets, isolating asset subsets with specific dependencies before applying mean-variance optimization.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations and empirical evidence demonstrate that BPASGM leads to more stable risk-return profiles, lower volatility, and better risk-adjusted performance compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: BPASGM offers a novel, statistically sound, and efficient approach to asset selection and portfolio construction, significantly improving practical portfolio performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction, termed the Best-Path Algorithm Sparse Graphical Model (BPASGM). The method extends the Best-Path Algorithm (BPA) by mapping linear and non-linear dependencies among a large set of financial assets into a sparse graphical model satisfying a structural Markov property. Based on this representation, BPASGM performs a dependence-driven screening that removes positively or redundantly connected assets, isolating subsets that are conditionally independent or negatively correlated. This step is designed to enhance diversification and reduce estimation error in high-dimensional portfolio settings. Portfolio optimization is then conducted on the selected subset using standard mean-variance techniques. BPASGM does not aim to improve the theoretical mean-variance optimum under known population parameters, but rather to enhance realized performance in finite samples, where sample-based Markowitz portfolios are highly sensitive to estimation error. Monte Carlo simulations show that BPASGM-based portfolios achieve more stable risk-return profiles, lower realized volatility, and superior risk-adjusted performance compared to standard mean-variance portfolios. Empirical results for U.S. equities, global stock indices, and foreign exchange rates over 1990-2025 confirm these findings and demonstrate a substantial reduction in portfolio cardinality. Overall, BPASGM offers a statistically grounded and computationally efficient framework that integrates sparse graphical modeling with portfolio theory for dependence-aware asset selection.

### [658] [When Should Agents Coordinate in Differentiable Sequential Decision Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03674)
*Caleb Probine,Su Ann Low,David Fridovich-Keil,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper investigates coordination mechanisms for multi-robot teams, exploring trade-offs between team-wide optimization and individually optimal choices, in motion-planning issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot teams often fail to coordinate effectively, which impacts their collective performance. Exploring mechanisms to balance costly communication and effective coordination is crucial.

Method: The paper models coordination as a spectrum between joint optimization of a team’s objective and individual Nash equilibrium-based decision-making. It leverages second-order analysis in differentiable motion-planning problems.

Result: Algorithms are developed to assess and determine optimal coordination times for agents within the team, using second-order reasoning.

Conclusion: Second-order reasoning can help identify when coordination is beneficial for multi-robot teams, balancing communication costs with improved outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-robot teams must coordinate to operate effectively. When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.

### [659] [Scaling Small Agents Through Strategy Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02751)
*Lisa Alazraki,William F. Shen,Yoram Bachrach,Akhil Mathur*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of small language models for complex tasks and proposes a new framework (SALE) inspired by freelancer marketplaces to improve efficiency by coordinating multiple agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of small language models for complex workloads and explore more cost-effective, efficient methods for agentic AI.

Method: The authors developed 'SALE' (Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency), where agents bid on tasks with strategic plans scored by a cost-value mechanism, facilitating task allocation and self-improvement.

Result: SALE reduces dependency on large models by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and improves task performance (pass@1) with minimal overhead, outperforming traditional model routers.

Conclusion: The study concludes that small agents can overcome limitations in complex workloads through coordinated task allocation and optimization. It advocates for adopting systems-level approaches to organize AI ecosystems effectively.

Abstract: Small language models are increasingly viewed as a promising, cost-effective approach to agentic AI, with proponents claiming they are sufficiently capable for agentic workflows. However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively "scaled up" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.

### [660] [Agent Primitives: Reusable Latent Building Blocks for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03695)
*Haibo Jin,Kuang Peng,Ye Yu,Xiaopeng Yuan,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent Primitives, reusable components for multi-agent systems (MAS) that improve efficiency and accuracy while addressing issues like task-specificity and instability in previous MAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAS are highly task-specific, complex, and prone to communication errors due to reliance on natural language interaction, which limits generalizability and robustness.

Method: The authors propose Agent Primitives, a set of reusable modules (Review, Voting and Selection, Planning and Execution) that communicate through a key-value cache to enhance efficiency and robustness. An Organizer agent dynamically selects and configures these primitives guided by past successful patterns.

Result: The proposed primitives-based MAS significantly improve accuracy by 12.0-16.5% compared to single-agent systems, reduce token usage and latency by 3-4x compared to existing MAS, and maintain stable performance with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Agent Primitives offer a scalable, efficient, and robust framework for MAS by reusing generalized modules that mitigate previous weaknesses while enhancing task versatility and performance stability.

Abstract: While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories.
  In this work, we propose \textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.
  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\times$-4$\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\times$-1.6$\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for studying social structures formed by autonomous AI agents, analyzing over 150,000 agents and their sub-communities on Moltbook through data mining and unsupervised clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically understand the large-scale collective behavior of autonomous agent ecosystems, which cannot be fully captured through anecdotal or small-scale observations.

Method: The authors analyzed descriptions of 12,758 agent-created sub-communities on Moltbook using data mining, preprocessing, contextual embeddings, and unsupervised clustering to uncover latent organizational patterns.

Result: The study found that agents organize their societies with human-like interests, reflective themes, and early economic behaviors, showing reproducible patterns of social structuring.

Conclusion: This research establishes a new framework for studying agent societies, showcasing how data mining can reveal insights into their organization and evolution without relying on predefined human taxonomies.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of autonomous large language model agents has given rise to persistent, large-scale agent ecosystems whose collective behavior cannot be adequately understood through anecdotal observation or small-scale simulation. This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.

### [662] [Sub-optimality bounds for certainty equivalent policies in partially observed systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02814)
*Berk Bozkurt,Aditya Mahajan,Ashutosh Nayyar,Yi Ouyang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper generalizes the classical certainty equivalence principle to non-linear partially observed stochastic systems, analyzing the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies when using general state estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the classical certainty equivalence principle, which is limited to linear systems and MMSE state estimates, to address more general non-linear partially observed stochastic systems.

Method: The authors consider certainty equivalent policies that use general state estimates (not limited to MMSE) and derive upper bounds on their sub-optimality when the cost and dynamics are smooth. Several examples are provided to validate the results.

Result: Upper bounds on the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies in general partially observed systems are derived, demonstrating the implications of using non-MMSE state estimates.

Conclusion: Certainty equivalent policies can be extended beyond MMSE-based linear systems, with quantified sub-optimality, broadening their applicability to non-linear systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the certainty equivalence principle of stochastic control. One interpretation of the classical certainty equivalence principle for linear systems with output feedback and quadratic costs is as follows: the optimal action at each time is obtained by evaluating the optimal state-feedback policy of the stochastic linear system at the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the state. Motivated by this interpretation, we consider certainty equivalent policies for general (non-linear) partially observed stochastic systems that allow for any state estimate rather than restricting to MMSE estimates. In such settings, the certainty equivalent policy is not optimal. For models where the cost and the dynamics are smooth in an appropriate sense, we derive upper bounds on the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies. We present several examples to illustrate the results.

### [663] [Fast Near Time-Optimal Motion Planning for Holonomic Vehicles in Structured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02826)
*Louis Callens,Bastiaan Vandewal,Ibrahim Ibrahim,Jan Swevers,Wilm Decré*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimization-based method to generate fast, near time-optimal trajectories for holonomic vehicles in complex and structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to create time-optimal and reactive trajectories for planar motion systems, such as those used in assembly lines and laboratories, is crucial for improving productivity and responsiveness.

Method: The environment is represented using free-space corridors, and vehicle motion is modeled using heuristically chosen motion primitives. The trajectory is optimized using these primitives and degrees of freedom, reducing computation time significantly.

Result: The proposed method achieves faster computation times compared to traditional methods like solving full Optimal Control Problems while maintaining near-optimal solutions in fixed corridor sequences.

Conclusion: The method is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a Beckhoff XPlanar system, proving its practical application and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and efficient optimization-based method for generating near time-optimal trajectories for holonomic vehicles navigating through complex but structured environments. The approach aims to solve the problem of motion planning for planar motion systems using magnetic levitation that can be used in assembly lines, automated laboratories or clean-rooms. In these applications, time-optimal trajectories that can be computed in real-time are required to increase productivity and allow the vehicles to be reactive if needed. The presented approach encodes the environment representation using free-space corridors and represents the motion of the vehicle through such a corridor using a motion primitive. These primitives are selected heuristically and define the trajectory with a limited number of degrees of freedom, which are determined in an optimization problem. As a result, the method achieves significantly lower computation times compared to the state-of-the-art, most notably solving a full Optimal Control Problem (OCP), OMG-tools or VP-STO without significantly compromising optimality within a fixed corridor sequence. The approach is benchmarked extensively in simulation and is validated on a real-world Beckhoff XPlanar system

Main category: cs.SC

TL;DR: This paper proposes using deep reinforcement learning to optimize monomial ordering in Gröbner basis computation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of solving systems of polynomial equations by optimizing monomial ordering, addressing limitations in traditional heuristics like GrevLex.

Method: The researchers framed monomial ordering selection as a reinforcement learning problem, utilized domain-informed reward signals, and applied Monte Carlo estimation for efficient training.

Result: Experiments showed that learned policies consistently performed better than standard heuristics in systems biology and computer vision benchmark problems, reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Deep reinforcement learning can uncover complex geometrical structures for Gröbner basis computation that static heuristics cannot exploit.

Abstract: The efficiency of Gröbner basis computation, the standard engine for solving systems of polynomial equations, depends on the choice of monomial ordering. Despite a near-continuum of possible monomial orders, most implementations rely on static heuristics such as GrevLex, guided primarily by expert intuition. We address this gap by casting the selection of monomial orderings as a reinforcement learning problem over the space of admissible orderings. Our approach leverages domain-informed reward signals that accurately reflect the computational cost of Gröbner basis computations and admits efficient Monte Carlo estimation. Experiments on benchmark problems from systems biology and computer vision show that the resulting learned policies consistently outperform standard heuristics, yielding substantial reductions in computational cost. Moreover, we find that these policies resist distillation into simple interpretable models, providing empirical evidence that deep reinforcement learning allows the agents to exploit non-linear geometric structure beyond the scope of traditional heuristics.

*Hao-Yuan He,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper integrates a predictive approach into solving smooth integer programs, proposing a method that remains effective even with prediction errors and allows oracle learnability with polynomial samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of algorithms for smooth integer programs by leveraging predictive models, while extending the tractability to broader problem regimes.

Method: The authors propose a framework that integrates a predictive oracle for constructing a linear surrogate objective, followed by linear programming and rounding, ensuring robustness to prediction errors.

Result: The framework extends tractable approximations from the dense to the near-dense regime, and demonstrates that the predictive oracle can be efficiently PAC-learned in polynomial samples.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between classical algorithmic methods and learning-augmented solutions, offering robust and efficient frameworks for predictive integer programming.

Abstract: This paper investigates learning-augmented algorithms for smooth integer programs, covering canonical problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-k-SAT. We introduce a framework that incorporates a predictive oracle to construct a linear surrogate of the objective, which is then solved via linear programming followed by a rounding procedure. Crucially, our framework ensures that the solution quality is both consistent and smooth against prediction errors. We demonstrate that this approach effectively extends tractable approximations from the classical dense regime to the near-dense regime. Furthermore, we go beyond the assumption of oracle existence by establishing its PAC-learnability. We prove that the induced algorithm class possesses a bounded pseudo-dimension, thereby ensuring that an oracle with near-optimal expected performance can be learned with polynomial samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap in current speech synthesis methods by aligning speech with visual scenes for immersive auditory experiences.

Method: It develops VividVoice, using a new dataset, Vivid-210K, and a core alignment module, D-MSVA, for aligning visual scenes with speech.

Result: VividVoice outperforms baseline models in audio fidelity, content clarity, and multimodal consistency based on experiments.

Conclusion: VividVoice successfully advances scene-aware speech synthesis, setting a higher standard for multimodal systems.

Abstract: We introduce and define a novel task-Scene-Aware Visually-Driven Speech Synthesis, aimed at addressing the limitations of existing speech generation models in creating immersive auditory experiences that align with the real physical world. To tackle the two core challenges of data scarcity and modality decoupling, we propose VividVoice, a unified generative framework. First, we constructed a large-scale, high-quality hybrid multimodal dataset, Vivid-210K, which, through an innovative programmatic pipeline, establishes a strong correlation between visual scenes, speaker identity, and audio for the first time. Second, we designed a core alignment module, D-MSVA, which leverages a decoupled memory bank architecture and a cross-modal hybrid supervision strategy to achieve fine-grained alignment from visual scenes to timbre and environmental acoustic features. Both subjective and objective experimental results provide strong evidence that VividVoice significantly outperforms existing baseline models in terms of audio fidelity, content clarity, and multimodal consistency.

### [667] [When Noise Lowers The Loss: Rethinking Likelihood-Based Evaluation in Music Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02738)
*Xiaosha Li,Chun Liu,Ziyu Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study identifies flaws in using standard cross-entropy loss as a sole quality indicator for music large language models (LLMs). It suggests that the loss curve's shape provides richer insights into model quality, proposing an intrinsic evaluation framework using noise injection experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music LLMs lack effective methods to evaluate output quality, and cross-entropy loss often fails to detect corrupted compositions. There is a need for a more robust and reliable evaluation framework.

Method: Noise injection experiment where controlled noise of varying lengths is added to musical pieces, observing the model's loss curve reaction, particularly sharp increases for short perturbations.

Result: MusicGen models were more sensitive to local texture-level disruptions than global semantic corruption. The shape of the loss curve provided deeper insights into model quality.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel evaluation method using loss curve profiling to assess musical quality, enabling better training and benchmarking frameworks for music LLMs.

Abstract: The rise of music large language models (LLMs) demands robust methods of evaluating output quality, especially in distinguishing high-quality compositions from "garbage music". Curiously, we observe that the standard cross-entropy loss -- a core training metric -- often decrease when models encounter systematically corrupted music, undermining its validity as a standalone quality indicator. To investigate this paradox, we introduce noise injection experiment, where controlled noise signal of varying lengths are injected into musical contexts. We hypothesize that a model's loss reacting positively to these perturbations, specifically a sharp increase ("Peak" area) for short injection, can serve as a proxy for its ability to discern musical integrity. Experiments with MusicGen models in the audio waveform domain confirm that Music LLMs respond more strongly to local, texture-level disruptions than to global semantic corruption. Beyond exposing this bias, our results highlight a new principle: the shape of the loss curve -- rather than its absolute value -- encodes critical information about the quality of the generated content (i.e., model behavior). We envision this profile-based evaluation as a label-free, model-intrinsic framework for assessing musical quality -- opening the door to more principled training objectives and sharper benchmarks.

*David McShannon,Anthony Mella,Nicholas Dietrich*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Synthetic data augmentation for medical audio classification (respiratory sound) was explored using a CNN and three generative models, but consistent performance improvement was not observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical audio classification faces challenges like low signal-to-noise ratios, subtle differences in features, limited training data, and class imbalances, motivating exploration of synthetic data augmentation.

Method: A CNN was trained on a moderately imbalanced dataset (73%:27%) using three augmentation techniques: variational autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models. Performance was evaluated using the F1-score.

Result: Baseline model achieved an F1-score of 0.645. Individual augmentation strategies failed to improve performance, and some degraded it. Only ensemble augmentation increased the F1-score slightly to 0.664.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation doesn't consistently improve performance for medical audio classification using a CNN. Focus on task-specific characteristics and model-augmentation compatibility is recommended.

Abstract: Medical audio classification remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, subtle discriminative features, and substantial intra-class variability, often compounded by class imbalance and limited training data. Synthetic data augmentation has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate these constraints; however, prior studies report inconsistent methodological approaches and mixed empirical results. In this preliminary study, we explore the impact of synthetic augmentation on respiratory sound classification using a baseline deep convolutional neural network trained on a moderately imbalanced dataset (73%:27%). Three generative augmentation strategies (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models) were assessed under controlled experimental conditions. The baseline model without augmentation achieved an F1-score of 0.645. Across individual augmentation strategies, performance gains were not observed, with several configurations demonstrating neutral or degraded classification performance. Only an ensemble of augmented models yielded a modest improvement in F1-score (0.664). These findings suggest that, for medical audio classification, synthetic augmentation may not consistently enhance performance when applied to a standard CNN classifier. Future work should focus on delineating task-specific data characteristics, model-augmentation compatibility, and evaluation frameworks necessary for synthetic augmentation to be effective in medical audio applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents a piano accompaniment model, D3PIA, using discrete diffusion and local alignment for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generation of musically coherent piano accompaniments adhering to melody and chord constraints.

Method: D3PIA utilizes discrete diffusion and Neighborhood Attention to align lead sheet inputs with piano-roll outputs.

Result: Evaluations indicate D3PIA outperforms baselines in preserving chord conditions and generating coherent music.

Conclusion: D3PIA offers an effective approach to symbolic piano accompaniment generation, with enhanced musical coherence.

Abstract: Generating piano accompaniments in the symbolic music domain is a challenging task that requires producing a complete piece of piano music from given melody and chord constraints, such as those provided by a lead sheet. In this paper, we propose a discrete diffusion-based piano accompaniment generation model, D3PIA, leveraging local alignment between lead sheet and accompaniment in piano-roll representation. D3PIA incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment. This design enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. We evaluate our model using the POP909 dataset, a widely used benchmark for piano accompaniment generation. Objective evaluation results demonstrate that D3PIA preserves chord conditions more faithfully compared to continuous diffusion-based and Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, a subjective listening test indicates that D3PIA generates more musically coherent accompaniments than the comparison models.

Result: The proposed method achieves efficient training, flexible post-training stylization, and supports partial metadata imputation for better music data organization.

Conclusion: Metadata-based captioning provides a more versatile and efficient approach compared to end-to-end models dependent on rigid LLM-generated captions.

Abstract: Music captioning, or the task of generating a natural language description of music, is useful for both music understanding and controllable music generation. Training captioning models, however, typically requires high-quality music caption data which is scarce compared to metadata (e.g., genre, mood, etc.). As a result, it is common to use large language models (LLMs) to synthesize captions from metadata to generate training data for captioning models, though this process imposes a fixed stylization and entangles factual information with natural language style. As a more direct approach, we propose metadata-based captioning. We train a metadata prediction model to infer detailed music metadata from audio and then convert it into expressive captions via pre-trained LLMs at inference time. Compared to a strong end-to-end baseline trained on LLM-generated captions derived from metadata, our method: (1) achieves comparable performance in less training time over end-to-end captioners, (2) offers flexibility to easily change stylization post-training, enabling output captions to be tailored to specific stylistic and quality requirements, and (3) can be prompted with audio and partial metadata to enable powerful metadata imputation or in-filling--a common task for organizing music data.

*Oscar Ovanger,Levi Harris,Timothy H. Keitt*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces FINCH, a framework for integrating audio classifiers with spatiotemporal predictors for more reliable bioacoustic classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address variability in reliability and informativeness of multiple evidence sources, especially in bioacoustic classification with both audio and spatiotemporal inputs.

Method: Introduced FINCH, an adaptive log-linear framework with a gating function to combine pre-trained audio classifiers and structured spatiotemporal predictors.

Result: FINCH outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CBI and BirdSet.

Conclusion: FINCH improves robustness and interpretability in evidence fusion, providing a lightweight and risk-contained approach for bioacoustic classification.

Abstract: Many machine learning systems have access to multiple sources of evidence for the same prediction target, yet these sources often differ in reliability and informativeness across inputs. In bioacoustic classification, species identity may be inferred both from the acoustic signal and from spatiotemporal context such as location and season; while Bayesian inference motivates multiplicative evidence combination, in practice we typically only have access to discriminative predictors rather than calibrated generative models. We introduce \textbf{F}usion under \textbf{IN}dependent \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{H}ypotheses (\textbf{FINCH}), an adaptive log-linear evidence fusion framework that integrates a pre-trained audio classifier with a structured spatiotemporal predictor. FINCH learns a per-sample gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual information from uncertainty and informativeness statistics. The resulting fusion family \emph{contains} the audio-only classifier as a special case and explicitly bounds the influence of contextual evidence, yielding a risk-contained hypothesis class with an interpretable audio-only fallback. Across benchmarks, FINCH consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, improving robustness and error trade-offs even when contextual information is weak in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on CBI and competitive or improved performance on several subsets of BirdSet using a lightweight, interpretable, evidence-based approach.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents PACE, a method overcoming challenges in audio continual learning with pretrained models, significantly outperforming others on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of robustness and scalability in audio continual learning using pretrained models, which struggle with data distribution shifts.

Method: Introduces PACE, involving regularized analytic classifiers, adaptive PEFT, and spectrogram-based boundary-aware perturbations for enhanced semantic alignment and stability.

Result: PACE delivers superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across six audio continual learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PACE makes significant advancements in audio continual learning by resolving key challenges, establishing it as a robust and scalable approach.

Abstract: Audio is a fundamental modality for analyzing speech, music, and environmental sounds. Although pretrained audio models have significantly advanced audio understanding, they remain fragile in real-world settings where data distributions shift over time. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for audio continual learning (CL) with pretrained models (PTMs), together with a comprehensive analysis of its unique challenges. Unlike in vision, where parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has proven effective for CL, directly transferring such strategies to audio leads to poor performance. This stems from a fundamental property of audio backbones: they focus on low-level spectral details rather than structured semantics, causing severe upstream-downstream misalignment. Through extensive empirical study, we identify analytic classifiers with first-session adaptation (FSA) as a promising direction, but also reveal two major limitations: representation saturation in coarse-grained scenarios and representation drift in fine-grained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PACE, a novel method that enhances FSA via a regularized analytic classifier and enables multi-session adaptation through adaptive subspace-orthogonal PEFT for improved semantic alignment. In addition, we introduce spectrogram-based boundary-aware perturbations to mitigate representation overlap and improve stability. Experiments on six diverse audio CL benchmarks demonstrate that PACE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking an important step toward robust and scalable audio continual learning with PTMs.

*Siyi Wang,Shihong Tan,Siyi Liu,Hong Jia,Gongping Huang,James Bailey,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces an analysis and method for controlling emotional expressions in speech synthesis systems, enabling nuanced and mixed-emotion synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expressive text-to-speech systems typically enforce a singular emotion, which limits the natural diversity of emotional expression and the capability to generate mixed or mismatched emotions. There was a need to explore if and how emotional representations can be better controlled in these systems.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic analysis of activation steering in hybrid TTS models. They proposed a quantitative, controllable steering framework and developed multi-rater evaluation protocols to achieve composable mixed-emotion and text-emotion mismatched expression.

Result: The study found that emotional prosody and variability are synthesized mainly by the TTS language module rather than the flow-matching module. The proposed lightweight steering approach effectively generated natural and human-like emotional speech.

Conclusion: Activation steering is a viable approach to improving emotional control in TTS systems, enabling more expressive, natural-sounding speech synthesis by addressing emotional diversity and composition.

Abstract: Emotional expression in human speech is nuanced and compositional, often involving multiple, sometimes conflicting, affective cues that may diverge from linguistic content. In contrast, most expressive text-to-speech systems enforce a single utterance-level emotion, collapsing affective diversity and suppressing mixed or text-emotion-misaligned expression. While activation steering via latent direction vectors offers a promising solution, it remains unclear whether emotion representations are linearly steerable in TTS, where steering should be applied within hybrid TTS architectures, and how such complex emotion behaviors should be evaluated. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of activation steering for emotional control in hybrid TTS models, introducing a quantitative, controllable steering framework, and multi-rater evaluation protocols that enable composable mixed-emotion synthesis and reliable text-emotion mismatch synthesis. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that emotional prosody and expressive variability are primarily synthesized by the TTS language module instead of the flow-matching module, and also provide a lightweight steering approach for generating natural, human-like emotional speech.

*Daniel Quigley*

Main category: math.LO

TL;DR: This paper proves that formal semantics and distributional semantics can be structurally combined for intensional semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between formal semantics and distributional semantics by showing their compatibility for intensional semantics.

Method: Kripke-style intensional models are embedded into vector spaces using injective mappings, with semantic functions extended to multilinear maps. Algebraic modal operators and a measure-theoretic approach for uncountable domains are developed.

Result: The frameworks are shown to align structurally, accommodating index sorts and deriving modal operators algebraically. Continuous parameters lead to a generalized, non-classical logic.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a formal correspondence between two semantic frameworks, contributing to bridging theoretical and computational understanding of meaning.

Abstract: Formal semantics and distributional semantics are distinct approaches to linguistic meaning: the former models meaning as reference via model-theoretic structures; the latter represents meaning as vectors in high-dimensional spaces shaped by usage. This paper proves that these frameworks are structurally compatible for intensional semantics. We establish that Kripke-style intensional models embed injectively into vector spaces, with semantic functions lifting to (multi)linear maps that preserve composition. The construction accommodates multiple index sorts (worlds, times, locations) via a compound index space, representing intensions as linear operators. Modal operators are derived algebraically: accessibility relations become linear operators, and modal conditions reduce to threshold checks on accumulated values. For uncountable index domains, we develop a measure-theoretic generalization in which necessity becomes truth almost everywhere and possibility becomes truth on a set of positive measure, a non-classical logic natural for continuous parameters.

*Tianyi Gong,Zijian Cao,Zixing Zhang,Jiangkai Wu,Xinggong Zhang,Shuguang Cui,Fangxin Wang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Morphe, the first VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming system, achieving high fidelity, loss resilience, and a 62.5% bandwidth saving compared to H.265.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite video streaming being critical, existing methods struggle in poor network conditions and either hit compression limits or fail in latency and fidelity. The aim is to draw on vision foundation models to overcome these limitations for generalization, better fidelity, and resilience.

Method: Morphe leverages visual tokenizers, spatiotemporal optimization under network constraints, and robust intelligent packet dropping within a VFM framework for real-time video streaming.

Result: Morphe achieves comparable visual quality, reduces bandwidth usage by 62.5% versus H.265, and delivers loss-resilient and real-time video in challenging network conditions.

Conclusion: Morphe represents a significant advance in multimedia streaming, introducing an effective VFM-based generative video streaming paradigm with high compression and robustness.

Abstract: Video streaming is a fundamental Internet service, while the quality still cannot be guaranteed especially in poor network conditions such as bandwidth-constrained and remote areas. Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NSC-SL, a bandwidth-aware adaptive compression algorithm to reduce communication overhead in split learning by dynamically determining low-rank approximation and minimizing truncation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of neural networks amplifies communication challenges in distributed machine learning, particularly when using split learning under bandwidth constraints.

Method: NSC-SL dynamically selects optimal low-rank approximations based on singular value distributions and uses error-compensated tensor factorization with residual feedback for efficient compression.

Result: The proposed NSC-SL achieves high compression rates while maintaining essential information, as validated by extensive experiments showing its effective performance.

Conclusion: NSC-SL successfully addresses the communication overhead in split learning, balancing efficiency and accuracy through adaptive bandwidth-aware compression.

Abstract: The expanding scale of neural networks poses a major challenge for distributed machine learning, particularly under limited communication resources. While split learning (SL) alleviates client computational burden by distributing model layers between clients and server, it incurs substantial communication overhead from frequent transmission of intermediate activations and gradients. To tackle this issue, we propose NSC-SL, a bandwidth-aware adaptive compression algorithm for communication-efficient SL. NSC-SL first dynamically determines the optimal rank of low-rank approximation based on the singular value distribution for adapting real-time bandwidth constraints. Then, NSC-SL performs error-compensated tensor factorization using alternating orthogonal iteration with residual feedback, effectively minimizing truncation loss. The collaborative mechanisms enable NSC-SL to achieve high compression ratios while preserving semantic-rich information essential for convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superb performance of NSC-SL.

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-cultural meme transcreation using vision-language models and introduces a bidirectional dataset for Chinese and US memes. It highlights challenges, evaluation methods, and cultural asymmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in preserving humor and communicative intent in memes while adapting them between cultures in a meaningful way.

Method: A hybrid transcreation framework was developed utilizing vision-language models, backed by a newly introduced bidirectional dataset of Chinese and US memes. Evaluation involved 6,315 meme pairs analyzed through human judgments and automated metrics.

Result: It was found that vision-language models have limited success in meme transcreation, revealing directional asymmetries: US-to-Chinese memes are consistently better transcreated than Chinese-to-US.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural meme transcreation is feasible but challenging. The study provides insights into humor transfer challenges and an evaluation framework, contributing to future progress in multimodal generation research.

Abstract: Memes are a pervasive form of online communication, yet their cultural specificity poses significant challenges for cross-cultural adaptation. We study cross-cultural meme transcreation, a multimodal generation task that aims to preserve communicative intent and humor while adapting culture-specific references. We propose a hybrid transcreation framework based on vision-language models and introduce a large-scale bidirectional dataset of Chinese and US memes. Using both human judgments and automated evaluation, we analyze 6,315 meme pairs and assess transcreation quality across cultural directions. Our results show that current vision-language models can perform cross-cultural meme transcreation to a limited extent, but exhibit clear directional asymmetries: US-Chinese transcreation consistently achieves higher quality than Chinese-US. We further identify which aspects of humor and visual-textual design transfer across cultures and which remain challenging, and propose an evaluation framework for assessing cross-cultural multimodal generation. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/AIM-SCU/MemeXGen.

TL;DR: The paper explores issues with current large language models (LLMs) in CS education, especially their vulnerability to inappropriate prompts, and introduces CodeGuard, a framework to address these concerns effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges caused by LLMs in CS education, including their susceptibility to adversarial and unsafe prompts, impacting academic integrity and learning effectiveness.

Method: The authors proposed CodeGuard, which includes a taxonomy for classifying prompts, the CodeGuard dataset with 8,000 sample prompts, and PromptShield, a model that detects unsafe prompts in real-time through sentence encoding.

Result: The CodeGuard framework, particularly PromptShield, achieved an F1 score of 0.93 and reduced harmful or policy-violating responses by 30-65% without affecting legitimate educational uses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of CodeGuard in improving safety and utility in educational LLM applications, offering valuable resources to the community for secure AI integration in classrooms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in Computer Science (CS) classrooms to automate code generation, feedback, and assessment. However, their susceptibility to adversarial or ill-intentioned prompts threatens student learning and academic integrity. To cope with this important issue, we evaluate existing off-the-shelf LLMs in handling unsafe and irrelevant prompts within the domain of CS education. We identify important shortcomings in existing LLM guardrails which motivates us to propose CodeGuard, a comprehensive guardrail framework for educational AI systems. CodeGuard includes (i) a first-of-its-kind taxonomy for classifying prompts; (ii) the CodeGuard dataset, a collection of 8,000 prompts spanning the taxonomy; and (iii) PromptShield, a lightweight sentence-encoder model fine-tuned to detect unsafe prompts in real time. Experiments show that PromptShield achieves 0.93 F1 score, surpassing existing guardrail methods. Additionally, further experimentation reveals that CodeGuard reduces potentially harmful or policy-violating code completions by 30-65% without degrading performance on legitimate educational tasks. The code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are made freely available to the community.

TL;DR: This paper introduces brain foundation models, large-scale AI systems pretrained on neural data (EEG, fMRI, etc.) for flexible downstream applications, and examines their ethical and governance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the ethical and normative challenges posed by applying the foundation model paradigm to neural data, given its sensitive nature and historical governance in clinical and research contexts.

Method: The authors describe the technical principles and the data ecosystem of brain foundation models and draw ethical concerns from AI ethics, neuroethics, and bioethics frameworks. They outline concerns in privacy, consent, bias, benefit sharing, and governance, proposing questions and safeguards.

Result: The paper identifies critical ethical issues related to the use of neural data for foundation models, emphasizing risks associated with privacy, governance, and commercial exploitation.

Conclusion: Brain foundation models open significant ethical and regulatory issues requiring careful consideration. The paper argues for a structured ethical framework and safeguards as the field progresses.

Abstract: Brain foundation models bring the foundation model paradigm to the field of neuroscience. Like language and image foundation models, they are general-purpose AI systems pretrained on large-scale datasets that adapt readily to downstream tasks. Unlike text-and-image based models, however, they train on brain data: large-datasets of EEG, fMRI, and other neural data types historically collected within tightly governed clinical and research settings. This paper contends that training foundation models on neural data opens new normative territory. Neural data carry stronger expectations of, and claims to, protection than text or images, given their body-derived nature and historical governance within clinical and research settings. Yet the foundation model paradigm subjects them to practices of large-scale repurposing, cross-context stitching, and open-ended downstream application. Furthermore, these practices are now accessible to a much broader range of actors, including commercial developers, against a backdrop of fragmented and unclear governance. To map this territory, we first describe brain foundation models' technical foundations and training-data ecosystem. We then draw on AI ethics, neuroethics, and bioethics to organize concerns across privacy, consent, bias, benefit sharing, and governance. For each, we propose both agenda-setting questions and baseline safeguards as the field matures.

### [680] [Measuring Individual User Fairness with User Similarity and Effectiveness Disparity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02516)
*Theresia Veronika Rampisela,Maria Maistro,Tuukka Ruotsalo,Christina Lioma*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Current evaluation measures for individual user fairness in recommender systems are limited and incomplete. This paper introduces a new measure, Pairwise User unFairness (PUF), which considers both effectiveness disparity and user similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing measures for evaluating individual user fairness in recommender systems fail to take both effectiveness disparity and user similarity into account simultaneously, thus providing an incomplete understanding of fairness.

Method: The authors propose Pairwise User unFairness (PUF), a novel evaluation metric that measures individual user fairness by accounting for both user similarity and disparity in effectiveness. They empirically validated PUF across four datasets and seven ranking algorithms.

Result: PUF demonstrates consistent and robust performance in capturing both user similarity and effectiveness disparity compared to other existing fairness measures. Competing metrics were insensitive to one or both of these factors.

Conclusion: By introducing PUF, the study provides the first reliable measurement of individual user fairness in recommender systems that integrates both effectiveness disparity and user similarity comprehensively.

Abstract: Individual user fairness is commonly understood as treating similar users similarly. In Recommender Systems (RSs), several evaluation measures exist for quantifying individual user fairness. These measures evaluate fairness via either: (i) the disparity in RS effectiveness scores regardless of user similarity, or (ii) the disparity in items recommended to similar users regardless of item relevance. Both disparity in recommendation effectiveness and user similarity are very important in fairness, yet no existing individual user fairness measure simultaneously accounts for both. In brief, current user fairness evaluation measures implement a largely incomplete definition of fairness. To fill this gap, we present Pairwise User unFairness (PUF), a novel evaluation measure of individual user fairness that considers both effectiveness disparity and user similarity. PUF is the only measure that can express this important distinction. We empirically validate that PUF does this consistently across 4 datasets and 7 rankers, and robustly when varying user similarity or effectiveness. In contrast, all other measures are either almost insensitive to effectiveness disparity or completely insensitive to user similarity. We contribute the first RS evaluation measure to reliably capture both user similarity and effectiveness in individual user fairness.

Motivation: To explore the impact of AI, specifically LLMs, in generating feedback in higher education to enhance student learning and improve teaching practices.

Method: Seven Large Language Models (LLMs) were given a structured rubric to generate quantitative and qualitative feedback on student-designed projects. The feedback was analyzed using Hughes, Smith, and Creese’s framework.

Result: LLMs were capable of producing structured and effective feedback, demonstrating potential as a valuable tool for learning when guided by clear instructions and context.

Conclusion: AI-based LLMs can serve as a meaningful and sustainable feedback tool in education, with proper contextualization and guidance ensuring their effectiveness.

Abstract: The importance of managing feedback practices in higher education has been widely recognised, as they play a crucial role in enhancing teaching, learning, and assessment processes. In today's educational landscape, feedback practices are increasingly influenced by technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). Understanding the impact of AI on feedback generation is essential for identifying its potential benefits and establishing effective implementation strategies. This study examines how AI-generated feedback supports student learning using a well-established analytical framework. Specifically, feedback produced by different Large Language Models (LLMs) was assessed in relation to student-designed projects within a training course on inclusive teaching and learning. The evaluation process involved providing seven LLMs with a structured rubric, developed by the university instructor, which defined specific criteria and performance levels. The LLMs were tasked with generating both quantitative assessments and qualitative feedback based on this rubric. The AI-generated feedback was then analysed using Hughes, Smith, and Creese's framework to evaluate its structure and effectiveness in fostering formative learning experiences. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs can generate well-structured feedback and hold great potential as a sustainable and meaningful feedback tool, provided they are guided by clear contextual information and a well-defined instructions that will be explored further in the conclusions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProphetKV, a method for improving the efficiency and accuracy of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by addressing token selection issues during recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods suffer from computational inefficiencies and decreased inference accuracy due to poor token selection that favors globally salient but query-irrelevant tokens.

Method: ProphetKV implements a user-query-driven KV cache reuse system with a dual-stage recomputation process, focusing on semantic relevance and layer-wise attention metrics.

Result: ProphetKV achieves up to 101% accuracy compared to full-prefill while using only 20% of the recomputation budget, with significant accuracy improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: ProphetKV enhances RAG efficiency and inference accuracy by addressing the crowding-out effect in token prioritization, suggesting its potential for broader applications in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The prefill stage of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is severely bottlenecked by computational overhead. To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental "crowding-out effect" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.
  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling near-atomic-level visualization of biomolecular assemblies. However, the exponential growth in cryo-EM data throughput and complexity, coupled with diverse downstream analytical tasks, necessitates unified computational frameworks that transcend current task-specific deep learning approaches with limited scalability and generalizability. We present CryoLVM, a foundation model that learns rich structural representations from experimental density maps with resolved structures by leveraging the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) integrated with SCUNet-based backbone, which can be rapidly adapted to various downstream tasks. We further introduce a novel histogram-based distribution alignment loss that accelerates convergence and enhances fine-tuning performance. We demonstrate CryoLVM's effectiveness across three critical cryo-EM tasks: density map sharpening, density map super-resolution, and missing wedge restoration. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple density map quality metrics, confirming its potential as a versatile model for a wide spectrum of cryo-EM applications.

### [686] [Sharp Inequalities between Total Variation and Hellinger Distances for Gaussian Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03202)
*Joonhyuk Jung,Chao Gao*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper examines the connection between total variation (TV) and Hellinger distances for Gaussian location mixtures and resolves an open problem, offering sharp bounds governing the two metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve understanding of the relationship between the total variation and Hellinger distances for Gaussian mixtures, addressing an unresolved question in the field and enabling entropic characterizations.

Method: The authors derive a general upper bound involving TV and Hellinger distances, construct sequences of mixing distributions to validate their bound's sharpness, and use these results to connect Gaussian mixture learning to statistical learning scenarios.

Result: An upper bound for Hellinger distance is established in terms of TV distance, a direct entropic characterization of Gaussian mixtures is derived, and the findings enable improved robust estimation and better minimax regret bounds under contamination.

Conclusion: The paper resolves an open question on TV and Hellinger distance relations, advancing theoretical understanding and enhancing practical applications in mixture modeling and robust statistics.

Abstract: We study the relation between the total variation (TV) and Hellinger distances between two Gaussian location mixtures. Our first result establishes a general upper bound: for any two mixing distributions supported on a compact set, the Hellinger distance between the two mixtures is controlled by the TV distance raised to a power $1-o(1)$, where the $o(1)$ term is of order $1/\log\log(1/\mathrm{TV})$. We also construct two sequences of mixing distributions that demonstrate the sharpness of this bound. Taken together, our results resolve an open problem raised in Jia et al. (2023) and thus lead to an entropic characterization of learning Gaussian mixtures in total variation. Our inequality also yields optimal robust estimation of Gaussian mixtures in Hellinger distance, which has a direct implication for bounding the minimax regret of empirical Bayes under Huber contamination.

### [687] [Orthogonal Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Rectangular Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03283)
*Haohua Chen,Songbin Liu,Junjie Ma*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimal orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm for estimating signals in a rectangular spiked matrix model with rotationally invariant noise, alongside results on its dynamics and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve signal estimation in the rectangular spiked matrix model, especially under general rotationally invariant noise conditions, by designing an algorithm with rigorous performance guarantees.

Method: The authors propose an OAMP algorithm whose high-dimensional dynamics are rigorously characterized by state evolution, optimize it for minimal mean-squared error, and compare its performance to known algorithms like AMP.

Result: The OAMP algorithm matches AMP's fixed points under i.i.d. Gaussian noise and is conjectured to achieve Bayes-optimal performance in broader rotationally invariant noise settings.

Conclusion: The optimal OAMP algorithm is a promising tool for signal estimation in complex noise environments, potentially setting the state-of-the-art in this domain.

Abstract: We propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm for signal estimation in the rectangular spiked matrix model with general rotationally invariant (RI) noise. We establish a rigorous state evolution that exactly characterizes the high-dimensional dynamics of the algorithm. Building on this framework, we derive an optimal variant of OAMP that minimizes the predicted mean-squared error at each iteration. For the special case of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the fixed point of the proposed OAMP algorithm coincides with that of the standard AMP algorithm. For general RI noise models, we conjecture that the optimal OAMP algorithm is statistically optimal within a broad class of iterative methods, and achieves Bayes-optimal performance in certain regimes.

### [688] [AI Assisted Economics Measurement From Survey: Evidence from Public Employee Pension Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02604)
*Tiancheng Wang,Krishna Sharma*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper presents an iterative framework using large language models to analyze survey structures, improve measurement precision, and clarify semantic components related to economic mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need to enhance economic measurement by directly utilizing survey data in new, efficient ways, while ensuring accurate and meaningful interpretation of survey responses.

Method: The framework uses large language models for soft mapping of survey responses, harmonizes data into sub-dimension scores, and iteratively refines taxonomy based on out-of-sample validity tests and overlap diagnostics.

Result: When applied to a public employee retirement plan survey, the framework successfully identified relevant behavioral signals and distinguished economic mechanisms like beliefs versus constraints influencing retirement choices.

Conclusion: The methodology is validated as a robust and portable approach for auditing survey instruments, enhancing empirical analysis, and informing better survey designs.

Abstract: We develop an iterative framework for economic measurement that leverages large language models to extract measurement structure directly from survey instruments. The approach maps survey items to a sparse distribution over latent constructs through what we term a soft mapping, aggregates harmonized responses into respondent level sub dimension scores, and disciplines the resulting taxonomy through out of sample incremental validity tests and discriminant validity diagnostics. The framework explicitly integrates iteration into the measurement construction process. Overlap and redundancy diagnostics trigger targeted taxonomy refinement and constrained remapping, ensuring that added measurement flexibility is retained only when it delivers stable out of sample performance gains. Applied to a large scale public employee retirement plan survey, the framework identifies which semantic components contain behavioral signal and clarifies the economic mechanisms, such as beliefs versus constraints, that matter for retirement choices. The methodology provides a portable measurement audit of survey instruments that can guide both empirical analysis and survey design.

### [689] [Stationarity and Spectral Characterization of Random Signals on Simplicial Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03055)
*Madeline Navarro,Andrei Buciulea,Santiago Segarra,Antonio Marques*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for analyzing random signals on simplicial complexes by generalizing stationarity and defining topological spectral methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph-based models fail to represent non-dyadic interactions or relationships among sets of nodes; simplicial complexes offer a richer representation for such data structures.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework by leveraging Hodge and Dirac spectral theory to generalize stationarity for signals in simplicial complexes, defining topological power spectral density (PSD), and characterizing these signals via spectral dualities.

Result: They define topological PSD, a critical spectral characterization, highlight the advantages of topological stationarity, and validate their framework through synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively extends classical notions of stationarity, providing broader applicability for modeling and analyzing signals on intricate topological structures like simplicial complexes.

Abstract: It is increasingly common for data to possess intricate structure, necessitating new models and analytical tools. Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations.

### [690] [Joint single-shot ToA and DoA estimation for VAA-based BLE ranging with phase ambiguity: A deep learning-based approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02503)
*Jincheng Xie,Yili Deng,Jiguang He,Pengyu Wang,Miaomiao Dong,Rui Tang,Zhongyi Huang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified model for DoA estimation on BLE devices using a single antenna, addressing binary phase ambiguity through a neural network framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to enable cost-effective DoA estimation on size-constrained BLE devices by overcoming limitations posed by binary phase ambiguity in BLE's single-shot CFR.

Method: The authors developed a unified model combining BLE two-way CFR with virtual antenna arrays and utilized a neural network-based phase recovery framework with predictors and a voting mechanism.

Result: The proposed method achieves accurate DoA and ToA estimation on BLE devices, with errors near the Cramer Rao bound at SNR ≥ 5 dB.

Conclusion: The framework makes DoA estimation feasible on BLE devices, enabling super resolution algorithms while addressing associated challenges like phase ambiguity.

Abstract: Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.

### [691] [VR-VFL: Joint Rate and Client Selection for Vehicular Federated Learning Under Imperfect CSI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03711)
*Metehan Karatas,Subhrakanti Dey,Christian Rohner,Jose Mairton Barros da Silva*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces VR-VFL, a federated learning method for vehicular edge networks that adapts to mobility and imperfect channel information, achieving faster convergence compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods for vehicular networks assume ideal or oversimplified conditions (e.g., fixed communication rounds, perfect channel state information), which makes them impractical for real-world scenarios with high vehicle mobility and imperfect channels.

Method: The proposed VR-VFL method employs dynamic client selection and adaptive transmission rates, allowing communication round times to adjust based on changing wireless conditions. It is guided by a bi-objective optimization framework to balance learning convergence and round completion time.

Result: The VR-VFL method demonstrates approximately 40% faster convergence compared to existing methods, according to simulation results.

Conclusion: VR-VFL provides a practical, efficient solution to federated learning in vehicular edge networks by addressing realistic challenges like vehicle mobility and suboptimal wireless conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning in vehicular edge networks faces major challenges in efficient resource allocation, largely due to high vehicle mobility and the presence of imperfect channel state information. Many existing methods oversimplify these realities, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal channel conditions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks. Simulation results show that the proposed VR-VFL scheme achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other methods in the literature.

*Changan Liu,Haoxin Sun,Ahad N. Zehmakan,Zhongzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving fairness for disadvantaged groups in social networks using a modified network structure to enhance PageRank fairness through edge rewiring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inherent unfairness in social networks where groups like females in male-dominated industries have limited access to vital information due to their network positions.

Method: The authors propose a linear-time algorithm based on a greedy approach and rooted spanning forests to optimize PageRank fairness by rewiring a fixed number of edges in the network.

Result: Experimental results show that the algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods and efficiently handles real-world networks with millions of nodes in minutes.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively improves PageRank fairness for disadvantaged groups by modifying network structures, offering a practical solution to network-based fairness challenges.

Abstract: We study the notion of unfairness in social networks, where a group such as females in a male-dominated industry are disadvantaged in access to important information, e.g. job posts, due to their less favorable positions in the network. We investigate a well-established network-based formulation of fairness called PageRank fairness, which refers to a fair allocation of the PageRank weights among distinct groups. Our goal is to enhance the PageRank fairness by modifying the underlying network structure. More precisely, we study the problem of maximizing PageRank fairness with respect to a disadvantaged group, when we are permitted to rewire a fixed number of edges in the network. Building on a greedy approach, we leverage techniques from fast sampling of rooted spanning forests to devise an effective linear-time algorithm for this problem. To evaluate the accuracy and performance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct a large set of experiments on various real-world network data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing ones. Our algorithm is capable of generating accurate solutions for networks of million nodes in just a few minutes.

*Olha Wloch,Liam Hebert,Robin Cohen,Lukasz Golab*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GASTON, a model for detecting harmful online behavior by integrating textual content with social norms and community user patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying toxicity, echo chambers, and misinformation in online communities, where meaning is influenced by both textual content and community norms.

Method: The model, GASTON, uses a contrastive initialization strategy to pretrain community embeddings based on user interactions, combining textual and user embedding analysis for downstream tasks.

Result: GASTON achieved better performance than state-of-the-art methods in tasks such as stress detection, toxicity scoring, and norm violation detection.

Conclusion: Understanding the interplay of user community norms and textual content enhances the ability to detect and mitigate harmful online interactions.

Abstract: Online communities have become essential places for socialization and support, yet they also possess toxicity, echo chambers, and misinformation. Detecting this harmful content is difficult because the meaning of an online interaction stems from both what is written (textual content) and where it is posted (social norms). We propose GASTON (Graph-Aware Social Transformer for Online Networks), which learns text and user embeddings that are grounded in their local norms, providing the necessary context for downstream tasks. The heart of our solution is a contrastive initialization strategy that pretrains community embeddings based on user membership patterns, capturing a community's user base before processing any text. This allows GASTON to distinguish between communities (e.g., a support group vs. a hate group) based on who interacts there, even if they share similar vocabulary. Experiments on tasks such as stress detection, toxicity scoring, and norm violation demonstrate that the embeddings produced by GASTON outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper discusses a shift from task-specific fine-tuning to unsupervised pretraining for dialogue models, leveraging community norms to address data scarcity and improve interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges such as hate speech and misinformation on online platforms by improving the modeling of conversations with less dependency on costly, high-quality human-labeled datasets.

Method: The proposed method introduces unsupervised pretraining to Discussion Transformers by incorporating community norms, aiming to replace reliance on human-labeled data.

Result: The proposed framework potentially reduces the need for labeled data while enhancing understanding and interpretation of social norms influencing AI decisions.

Conclusion: This work proposes a significant step towards advancing ethical AI through unsupervised pretraining, enabling better handling of societal challenges and interpretations that align with community values.

Abstract: Modelling the complex dynamics of online social platforms is critical for addressing challenges such as hate speech and misinformation. While Discussion Transformers, which model conversations as graph structures, have emerged as a promising architecture, their potential is severely constrained by reliance on high-quality, human-labelled datasets. In this paper, we advocate a paradigm shift from task-specific fine-tuning to unsupervised pretraining, grounded in an entirely novel consideration of community norms. We posit that this framework not only mitigates data scarcity but also enables interpretation of the social norms underlying the decisions made by such an AI system. Ultimately, we believe that this direction offers many opportunities for AI for Social Good.

### [695] [CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs in Disaster Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02601)
*Hieu Duong,Eugene Levin,Todd Gary,Long Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CaST, a framework leveraging spatio-temporal graphs and LLMs for causality detection in disaster-related tweets, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a causal discovery method that captures semantic, spatial, and temporal contexts from social media for effective situational awareness, especially in disasters.

Method: CaST integrates semantic data, geographic and temporal features into spatio-temporal graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs a Graph Attention Network for causal inference.

Result: Experimental testing on Hurricane Harvey tweet data shows CaST surpasses traditional and advanced methods in recall and training stability, proving the importance of spatio-temporal factors.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatio-temporal reasoning into event graphs results in more accurate, stable, and interpretable causality detection in disaster scenarios via social media.

Abstract: Understanding causality between real-world events from social media is essential for situational awareness, yet existing causal discovery methods often overlook the interplay between semantic, spatial, and temporal contexts. We propose CaST: Causal Discovery via Spatio-Temporal Graphs, a unified framework for causal discovery in disaster domain that integrates semantic similarity and spatio-temporal proximity using Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on disaster datasets. CaST constructs an event graph for each window of tweets. Each event extracted from tweets is represented as a node embedding enriched with its contextual semantics, geographic coordinates, and temporal features. These event nodes are then connected to form a spatio-temporal event graph, which is processed using a multi-head Graph Attention Network (GAT) \cite{gat} to learn directed causal relationships. We construct an in-house dataset of approximately 167K disaster-related tweets collected during Hurricane Harvey and annotated following the MAVEN-ERE schema. Experimental results show that CaST achieves superior performance over both traditional and state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further confirm that incorporating spatial and temporal signals substantially improves both recall and stability during training. Overall, CaST demonstrates that integrating spatio-temporal reasoning into event graphs enables more robust and interpretable causal discovery in disaster-related social media text.

*Faezeh Fadaei,Jenny Carla Moran,Taha Yasseri*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper examines identity performance of AI chatbots on a social media platform, revealing fluid gender identity among bots but a tendency for gender-based grouping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative AI and LLMs develop identity through interactions in large networks.

Method: Analyzing Chirper.ai, a bot-driven social media platform with data over one year, focusing on gender performance and followership dynamics.

Result: Gender performance among chatbots is fluid, yet networks exhibit strong homophily based on gender similarity through both social selection and influence mechanisms.

Conclusion: LLMs mimic human-like social behaviors in gender-based sorting, highlighting implications for their use in synthetic environments and decision-making applications.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive settings, yet we know little about how their identity performance develops when they interact within large-scale networks. We address this by examining Chirper.ai, a social media platform similar to X but composed entirely of autonomous AI chatbots. Our dataset comprises over 70,000 agents, approximately 140 million posts, and the evolving followership network over one year. Based on agents' text production, we assign weekly gender scores to each agent. Results suggest that each agent's gender performance is fluid rather than fixed. Despite this fluidity, the network displays strong gender-based homophily, as agents consistently follow others performing gender similarly. Finally, we investigate whether these homophilic connections arise from social selection, in which agents choose to follow similar accounts, or from social influence, in which agents become more similar to their followees over time. Consistent with human social networks, we find evidence that both mechanisms shape the structure and evolution of interactions among LLMs. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of bodies, cultural entraining of gender performance leads to gender-based sorting. This has important implications for LLM applications in synthetic hybrid populations, social simulations, and decision support.

TL;DR: The paper investigates political biases in social media friend recommendation systems using real-world data from X platform, revealing correlations between user positions and recommendation embedding spaces, while exploring privacy-focused recommendation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how recommender systems in social media platforms process and represent political and social attributes of users, addressing concerns about algorithmic profiling and privacy.

Method: A data donation program collected 2.5M friend recommendations to study political bias in X platform's recommendation systems. User positions in recommender embedding spaces were analyzed using publicly available knowledge and ideological scaling.

Result: Findings show the recommendation system aligns with users' political positions (Left-Right spectrum with high correlation) which is independent of socio-demographic attributes.

Conclusion: The study reveals potential risks of algorithmic profiling and suggests constrained recommendation methods to reduce political influence, contributing to data privacy regulation compliance while maintaining recommendation effectiveness.

Abstract: Studies on recommendations in social media have mainly analyzed the quality of recommended items (e.g., their diversity or biases) and the impact of recommendation policies (e.g., in comparison with purely chronological policies). We use a data donation program, collecting more than 2.5 million friend recommendations made to 682 volunteers on X over a year, to study instead how real-world recommenders learn, represent and process political and social attributes of users inside the so-called black boxes of AI systems. Using publicly available knowledge on the architecture of the recommender, we inferred the positions of recommended users in its embedding space. Leveraging ideology scaling calibrated with political survey data, we analyzed the political position of users in our study (N=26,509 among volunteers and recommended contacts) among several attributes, including age and gender. Our results show that the platform's recommender system produces a spatial ordering of users that is highly correlated with their Left-Right positions (Pearson rho=0.887, p-value < 0.0001), and that cannot be explained by socio-demographic attributes. These results open new possibilities for studying the interaction between human and AI systems. They also raise important questions linked to the legal definition of algorithmic profiling in data privacy regulation by blurring the line between active and passive profiling. We explore new constrained recommendation methods enabled by our results, limiting the political information in the recommender as a potential tool for privacy compliance capable of preserving recommendation relevance.

### [698] [Beyond Content: Behavioral Policies Reveal Actors in Information Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02838)
*Philipp J. Schneider,Lanqin Yuan,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study proposes a novel method to detect malicious actors online by analyzing user behavioral policies rather than focusing on text/content or network features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to challenges with traditional methods (e.g., generative text models, limited data access, migration to unregulated platforms), there is a need for robust and resilient frameworks to identify online influence operations.

Method: The researchers modeled user activities as sequential decision-making processes and developed activity-based representations. These methods were tested on 12,064 Reddit users (including accounts linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency), analyzing their activity from 2015 to 2018.

Result: Policy-based classifiers outperformed content models in detecting malicious users and exhibited higher accuracy (macro-F1 of 94.9% vs. 91.2%). They demonstrated better early detection capabilities and resilience to evasion techniques/data corruption.

Conclusion: Behavioral dynamics offer a stable and discriminative approach for detecting online manipulation, paving the way for cross-platform detection strategies in environments with synthetic content and restricted data access.

Abstract: The detection of online influence operations -- coordinated campaigns by malicious actors to spread narratives -- has traditionally depended on content analysis or network features. These approaches are increasingly brittle as generative models produce convincing text, platforms restrict access to behavioral data, and actors migrate to less-regulated spaces. We introduce a platform-agnostic framework that identifies malicious actors from their behavioral policies by modeling user activity as sequential decision processes. We apply this approach to 12,064 Reddit users, including 99 accounts linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency in Reddit's 2017 transparency report, analyzing over 38 million activity steps from 2015-2018. Activity-based representations, which model how users act rather than what they post, consistently outperform content models in detecting malicious accounts. When distinguishing trolls -- users engaged in coordinated manipulation -- from ordinary users, policy-based classifiers achieve a median macro-$F_1$ of 94.9%, compared to 91.2% for text embeddings. Policy features also enable earlier detection from short traces and degrade more gracefully under evasion strategies or data corruption. These findings show that behavioral dynamics encode stable, discriminative signals of manipulation and point to resilient, cross-platform detection strategies in the era of synthetic content and limited data access.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how biases and harmful behaviors evolve on Chirper.ai, an LLM-driven social media platform. It analyzes 7M interactions among 32K LLM agents, including toxic behavior, ideological leanings, and polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models (LLMs) interacting on social platforms like Chirper.ai develop biases, exhibit toxic behaviors, and handle social influence.

Method: The study analyzed 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents, exploring their homophily, social influence, toxic behavior, and ideological leanings. It also proposed a mitigation strategy named Chain of Social Thought (CoST).

Result: The research found that LLM social networks mimic human phenomena like homophily and social influence but differ in toxic behavior patterns. CoST was successfully introduced to reduce harmful postings.

Conclusion: LLMs show similarities to humans in social interactions but require mechanisms like CoST to manage and limit detrimental behaviors, ensuring safer social environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting.

*Nicolás E. Díaz Ferreyra,Moritz Mock,Max Kretschmann,Barbara Russo,Mojtaba Shahin,Mansooreh Zahedi,Riccardo Scandariato*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Static Analysis Tools (SATs) aid in early code vulnerability detection, but face issues like false positives and limited scope. This study explores leveraging Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in code comments to enhance SAT efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of SATs, such as false positives and inability to cover all vulnerabilities, by investigating the potential of SATD as a complementary source of security insights.

Method: The study uses a mixed-methods approach involving (i) analysis of SATD-annotated vulnerability datasets with three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) a survey with 72 security practitioners.

Result: The study found that SATs detected 114 out of 135 security-related SATD examples, revealing several vulnerabilities SATs typically miss. Survey responses indicated that developers use SATD insights along with SAT outputs to better address security issues.

Conclusion: SATD serves as a valuable addition to SAT efforts, helping mitigate SAT limitations and improving the overall security analysis by identifying vulnerabilities that SATs alone may overlook.

Abstract: Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes.

*Haoran Ou,Kangjie Chen,Gelei Deng,Hangcheng Liu,Jie Zhang,Tianwei Zhang,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DECEIVE-AFC, an adversarial attack framework targeting fact-checking systems powered by large language models, significantly reducing their accuracy and demonstrating strong effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient understanding of adversarial attacks on search-enabled LLM-based fact-checking systems and improve insights into their vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors propose DECEIVE-AFC, an agent-based attack framework focused on claim-level attack strategies and validity evaluation methods, targeting search behavior, evidence retrieval, and reasoning without requiring access to model internals.

Result: Extensive evaluations show DECEIVE-AFC reduces verification accuracy from 78.7% to 53.7% and outperforms existing baselines in cross-system transferability.

Conclusion: DECEIVE-AFC highlights significant vulnerabilities in LLM-based fact-checking systems, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Fact-checking systems with search-enabled large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for verifying claims by dynamically retrieving external evidence. However, the robustness of such systems against adversarial attack remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we study adversarial claim attacks against search-enabled LLM-based fact-checking systems under a realistic input-only threat model. We propose DECEIVE-AFC, an agent-based adversarial attack framework that integrates novel claim-level attack strategies and adversarial claim validity evaluation principles. DECEIVE-AFC systematically explores adversarial attack trajectories that disrupt search behavior, evidence retrieval, and LLM-based reasoning without relying on access to evidence sources or model internals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and real-world systems demonstrate that our attacks substantially degrade verification performance, reducing accuracy from 78.7% to 53.7%, and significantly outperform existing claim-based attack baselines with strong cross-system transferability.

*Xilong Wang,Yinuo Liu,Zhun Wang,Dawn Song,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WebSentinel detects and localizes prompt injection attacks in webpages using a two-step process, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of detecting and localizing prompt injection attacks in web agents, which existing methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: WebSentinel utilizes a two-step approach: extracting potentially contaminated segments from a webpage in Step I, followed by validating the consistency of these segments with the webpage context in Step II.

Result: WebSentinel significantly outperforms baseline methods across diverse datasets containing both contaminated and clean webpages.

Conclusion: WebSentinel proves highly effective in pinpointing prompt injection threats and enhances the reliability of web-agent systems.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks manipulate webpage content to cause web agents to execute attacker-specified tasks instead of the user's intended ones. Existing methods for detecting and localizing such attacks achieve limited effectiveness, as their underlying assumptions often do not hold in the web-agent setting. In this work, we propose WebSentinel, a two-step approach for detecting and localizing prompt injection attacks in webpages. Given a webpage, Step I extracts \emph{segments of interest} that may be contaminated, and Step II evaluates each segment by checking its consistency with the webpage content as context. We show that WebSentinel is highly effective, substantially outperforming baseline methods across multiple datasets of both contaminated and clean webpages that we collected.

### [703] [To Defend Against Cyber Attacks, We Must Teach AI Agents to Hack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02595)
*Terry Yue Zhuo,Yangruibo Ding,Wenbo Guo,Ruijie Meng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses the inevitability of AI-driven cyber attacks, emphasizing the need for offensive AI capabilities as defensive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rising threat of AI agents automating tailored cyber attacks at scale and the limitations of current defensive measures.

Method: The authors propose three points: building benchmarks for attack lifecycle, advancing AI agents for vulnerability discovery, and robust governance to manage offensive capabilities responsibly.

Result: The paper highlights that current defenses are insufficient against adaptive adversaries and offensive AI capabilities need to be treated as critical defensive infrastructure.

Conclusion: Mastering offensive AI capabilities in controlled settings is essential to counteract AI-driven cyber threats effectively and responsibly.

Abstract: For over a decade, cybersecurity has relied on human labor scarcity to limit attackers to high-value targets manually or generic automated attacks at scale. Building sophisticated exploits requires deep expertise and manual effort, leading defenders to assume adversaries cannot afford tailored attacks at scale. AI agents break this balance by automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation across thousands of targets, needing only small success rates to remain profitable. Current developers focus on preventing misuse through data filtering, safety alignment, and output guardrails. Such protections fail against adversaries who control open-weight models, bypass safety controls, or develop offensive capabilities independently. We argue that AI-agent-driven cyber attacks are inevitable, requiring a fundamental shift in defensive strategy. In this position paper, we identify why existing defenses cannot stop adaptive adversaries and demonstrate that defenders must develop offensive security intelligence. We propose three actions for building frontier offensive AI capabilities responsibly. First, construct comprehensive benchmarks covering the full attack lifecycle. Second, advance from workflow-based to trained agents for discovering in-wild vulnerabilities at scale. Third, implement governance restricting offensive agents to audited cyber ranges, staging release by capability tier, and distilling findings into safe defensive-only agents. We strongly recommend treating offensive AI capabilities as essential defensive infrastructure, as containing cybersecurity risks requires mastering them in controlled settings before adversaries do.

### [704] [Time Is All It Takes: Spike-Retiming Attacks on Event-Driven Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03284)
*Yi Yu,Qixin Zhang,Shuhan Ye,Xun Lin,Qianshan Wei,Kun Wang,Wenhan Yang,Dacheng Tao,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores timing-only adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks (SNNs), introducing a novel threat model and optimization technique for retiming spikes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that current spiking neural networks are vulnerable to timing-only adversarial attacks and to assess their robustness under such conditions.

Method: Introduced a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with three budgets (per-spike jitter, total delay, tamper count) and used projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization for efficient retiming while complying with non-overlap and other constraints.

Result: Experimentation on benchmarks like CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, and N-MNIST showed timing-only attacks with high success rates (e.g., over 90% on DVS-Gesture) while minimally perturbing spike numbers.

Conclusion: Spike retiming attacks pose a significant and practical threat to event-driven SNNs, exposing their vulnerability to timing-based perturbations even when defenses are applied.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\mathcal{B}_{\infty}$, total delay $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\%$) while touching fewer than $2\%$ of spikes under $\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.

*Alexander Loth,Dominique Conceicao Rosario,Peter Ebinger,Martin Kappes,Marc-Oliver Pahl*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Origin Lens, a privacy-focused mobile framework that locally verifies visual content for authenticity using layered verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI challenges maintaining information integrity, necessitating frameworks that bridge model governance with consumer-level content verification.

Method: The system, developed with Rust and Flutter, operates on-device to verify image provenance cryptographically and detect AI-generated content. It incorporates multiple signals like generative fingerprints for verification without relying on server-side processes.

Result: Origin Lens provides users with graded confidence indicators about the authenticity of visual content and complies with regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act and DSA.

Conclusion: Origin Lens establishes a local, privacy-conscious verification infrastructure that enhances end-user trust and complements platform-level governance in addressing visual disinformation.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI poses challenges for information integrity assurance, requiring systems that connect model governance with end-user verification. We present Origin Lens, a privacy-first mobile framework that targets visual disinformation through a layered verification architecture. Unlike server-side detection systems, Origin Lens performs cryptographic image provenance verification and AI detection locally on the device via a Rust/Flutter hybrid architecture. Our system integrates multiple signals - including cryptographic provenance, generative model fingerprints, and optional retrieval-augmented verification - to provide users with graded confidence indicators at the point of consumption. We discuss the framework's alignment with regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, DSA) and its role in verification infrastructure that complements platform-level mechanisms.

### [706] [TinyGuard:A lightweight Byzantine Defense for Resource-Constrained Federated Learning via Statistical Update Fingerprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02615)
*Ali Mahdavi,Santa Aghapour,Azadeh Zamanifar,Amirfarhad Farhadi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TinyGuard introduces a lightweight defense against Byzantine attacks in federated learning by using statistical fingerprints, maintaining FedAvg convergence and achieving high accuracy under diverse attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiencies of existing Byzantine defense mechanisms in federated learning, making them feasible for large-scale and resource-constrained systems.

Method: TinyGuard extracts statistical fingerprints from client updates (norms, ratios, sparsity, moments) rather than relying on high-dimensional gradient computation. It uses statistical deviations in the reduced-dimensional fingerprint space to detect Byzantine clients efficiently.

Result: Achieves up to 95% accuracy in detecting Byzantine attacks like sign-flipping, scaling, and poisoning. Demonstrates resilience against adaptive white-box adversaries and stable performance despite data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: TinyGuard provides an efficient, architecture-agnostic defense for federated fine-tuning of foundation models, overcoming limitations of traditional Byzantine defenses in terms of practicality and performance.

Abstract: Existing Byzantine robust aggregation mechanisms typically rely on fulldimensional gradi ent comparisons or pairwise distance computations, resulting in computational overhead that limits applicability in large scale and resource constrained federated systems. This paper proposes TinyGuard, a lightweight Byzantine defense that augments the standard FedAvg algorithm via statistical update f ingerprinting. Instead of operating directly on high-dimensional gradients, TinyGuard extracts compact statistical fingerprints cap turing key behavioral properties of client updates, including norm statistics, layer-wise ratios, sparsity measures, and low-order mo ments. Byzantine clients are identified by measuring robust sta tistical deviations in this low-dimensional fingerprint space with nd complexity, without modifying the underlying optimization procedure. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, ViT-Lite, and ViT-Small with LoRA adapters demonstrate that TinyGuard pre serves FedAvg convergence in benign settings and achieves up to 95 percent accuracy under multiple Byzantine attack scenarios, including sign-flipping, scaling, noise injection, and label poisoning. Against adaptive white-box adversaries, Pareto frontier analysis across four orders of magnitude confirms that attackers cannot simultaneously evade detection and achieve effective poisoning, features we term statistical handcuffs. Ablation studies validate stable detection precision 0.8 across varying client counts (50-150), threshold parameters and extreme data heterogeneity . The proposed framework is architecture-agnostic and well-suited for federated fine-tuning of foundation models where traditional Byzantine defenses become impractical

### [707] [Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Electronic Health Records: Securing Participant Identity with Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02629)
*Rodrigo Tertulino,Ricardo Almeida,Laercio Alencar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) framework called TBFL that uses Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technology to improve data security and resist attacks in healthcare AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy and security challenges in leveraging massive Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for training AI models, particularly overcoming data silos and vulnerabilities in Federated Learning (FL).

Method: The method integrates Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), into a Blockchain-based FL framework to ensure cryptographic identity verification.

Result: The framework neutralized 100% of Sybil attacks, maintained a strong predictive performance (AUC=0.954, Recall=0.890), and incurred minimal computational overhead (<0.12%) with low operational costs ($18 for 100 training rounds).

Conclusion: This TBFL framework enhances the security, scalability, and cost-efficiency of collaborative healthcare AI, offering a robust solution for inter-institutional data sharing while adhering to strict privacy regulations.

Abstract: The digitization of healthcare has generated massive volumes of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), offering unprecedented opportunities for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA have created data silos that prevent centralized training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. Despite its potential, FL remains vulnerable to poisoning and Sybil attacks, in which malicious participants corrupt the global model or infiltrate the network using fake identities. While recent approaches integrate Blockchain technology for auditability, they predominantly rely on probabilistic reputation systems rather than robust cryptographic identity verification. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning (TBFL) framework integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our architecture ensures only authenticated healthcare entities contribute to the global model. Through comprehensive evaluation using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we demonstrate that anchoring trust in cryptographic identity verification rather than behavioral patterns significantly mitigates security risks while maintaining clinical utility. Our results show the framework successfully neutralizes 100% of Sybil attacks, achieves robust predictive performance (AUC = 0.954, Recall = 0.890), and introduces negligible computational overhead (<0.12%). The approach provides a secure, scalable, and economically viable ecosystem for inter-institutional health data collaboration, with total operational costs of approximately $18 for 100 training rounds across multiple institutions.

### [708] [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Zero-shot and Few-shot Phishing URL Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02641)
*Najmul Hasan,Prashanth BusiReddyGari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) for phishing URL detection using zero-shot and few-shot learning, highlighting the evolving threat landscape led by generative AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the escalating sophistication of phishing URLs driven by AI advancements and the inadequacy of traditional detection tools to identify such deceptive URLs effectively.

Method: The study benchmarks LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot learning framework using a balanced dataset, while evaluating performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC.

Result: Few-shot prompting enhances phishing URL detection performance across multiple LLMs, quantified through detailed metrics demonstrating its practicality.

Conclusion: Few-shot prompting with LLMs is a promising solution for improving phishing detection in cybersecurity, capable of generalizing in dynamic and evolving threatscapes.

Abstract: The Uniform Resource Locator (URL), introduced in a connectivity-first era to define access and locate resources, remains historically limited, lacking future-proof mechanisms for security, trust, or resilience against fraud and abuse, despite the introduction of reactive protections like HTTPS during the cybersecurity era. In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs. Our evaluation uses a balanced dataset with consistent prompts, offering detailed analysis of performance, generalization, and model efficacy, quantified by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC, to reflect both classification quality and practical utility in threat detection settings. We conclude few-shot prompting improves performance across multiple LLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Eidolon utilizes the k-colorability problem to propose a post-quantum signature scheme with compressed signatures and resistance to modern cryptanalysis methods, including machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a credible post-quantum signature scheme using combinatorial hardness against quantum and classical adversaries.

Method: The scheme generalizes the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson zero-knowledge protocol to arbitrary k >= 3, applies Fiat-Shamir transformation, uses Merkle-tree commitments for compression, and generates difficult instances through planted 'quiet' colorings.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that for graphs with n >= 60, neither classical solvers nor graph neural network (GNN) attackers can recover the secret coloring.

Conclusion: This research revives combinatorial hardness as a viable foundation for designing post-quantum signature schemes that withstand modern cryptanalysis techniques.

Abstract: We propose Eidolon, a practical post-quantum signature scheme based on the NP-complete k-colorability problem. Our construction generalizes the Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson zero-knowledge protocol to arbitrary k >= 3, applies the Fiat-Shamir transform, and uses Merkle-tree commitments to compress signatures from O(tn) to O(t log n). Crucially, we generate hard instances via planted "quiet" colorings that preserve the statistical profile of random graphs. We present the first empirical security analysis of such a scheme against both classical solvers (ILP, DSatur) and a custom graph neural network (GNN) attacker. Experiments show that for n >= 60, neither approach recovers the secret coloring, demonstrating that well-engineered k-coloring instances can resist modern cryptanalysis, including machine learning. This revives combinatorial hardness as a credible foundation for post-quantum signatures.

*Nirab Hossain,Pablo Moriano*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of machine learning-based CAN intrusion detection systems (IDS) against adversarial attacks, showing vulnerabilities in both shallow and deep models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing use of machine learning-based IDS in vehicles and concerns over their robustness to adversarial manipulations, which pose safety risks for in-vehicle communication systems.

Method: The authors systematically test shallow and deep machine learning models on the ROAD dataset using adversarial attacks like FGSM, BIM, and PGD that generate payload-level perturbations compliant with the CAN protocol.

Result: Adversarial attacks expose significant vulnerabilities, with all models experiencing increased missed attack rates. The deep neural network shows strong performance under benign traffic, while the shallow model, extra trees, exhibits relatively higher robustness against missed attack induction.

Conclusion: The study highlights the susceptibility of automotive IDS to adversarial manipulations and the need for robust defenses to ensure the reliability of such systems in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Modern vehicles rely on electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected through the Controller Area Network (CAN), making in-vehicle communication a critical security concern. Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are increasingly deployed to protect CAN traffic, yet their robustness against adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present a systematic adversarial evaluation of CAN IDS using the ROAD dataset, comparing four shallow learning models with a deep neural network-based detector. Using protocol-compliant, payload-level perturbations generated via FGSM, BIM and PGD, we evaluate adversarial effects on both benign and malicious CAN frames. While all models achieve strong baseline performance under benign conditions, adversarial perturbations reveal substantial vulnerabilities. Although shallow and deep models are robust to false-alarm induction, with the deep neural network (DNN) performing best on benign traffic, all architectures suffer significant increases in missed attacks. Notably, under gradient-based attacks, the shallow model extra trees (ET) demonstrates improved robustness to missed-attack induction compared to the other models. Our results demonstrate that adversarial manipulation can simultaneously trigger false alarms and evade detection, underscoring the need for adversarial robustness evaluation in safety-critical automotive IDS.

*Xianzhen Luo,Jingyuan Zhang,Shiqi Zhou,Rain Huang,Chuan Xiao,Qingfu Zhu,Zhiyuan Ma,Xing Yue,Yang Yue,Wencong Zeng,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CVE-Factory, a groundbreaking framework for transforming sparse CVE metadata into high-quality, executable security tasks. It provides automation that improves testing and benchmarking for code security agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges of costly, unscalable manual reproduction of security tasks and tackle issues with outdated data distributions for effective evaluation and training of code security agents.

Method: The authors developed CVE-Factory, a multi-agent framework, to automatically transform sparse CVE metadata into executable security tasks. It includes cross-validation with human experts and evaluation on recent vulnerabilities.

Result: CVE-Factory demonstrated a 95% correctness rate and 96% fidelity compared to expert reproductions, as well as handling emerging vulnerabilities effectively with 66.2% verified success. It also enabled the creation of LiveCVEBench and large-scale training environments.

Conclusion: CVE-Factory efficiently automates vulnerability task generation and enables advancements in code security benchmarks and agent training. The open-sourced resources enhance research accessibility and innovation.

Abstract: Evaluating and improving the security capabilities of code agents requires high-quality, executable vulnerability tasks. However, existing works rely on costly, unscalable manual reproduction and suffer from outdated data distributions. To address these, we present CVE-Factory, the first multi-agent framework to achieve expert-level quality in automatically transforming sparse CVE metadata into fully executable agentic tasks. Cross-validation against human expert reproductions shows that CVE-Factory achieves 95\% solution correctness and 96\% environment fidelity, confirming its expert-level quality. It is also evaluated on the latest realistic vulnerabilities and achieves a 66.2\% verified success. This automation enables two downstream contributions. First, we construct LiveCVEBench, a continuously updated benchmark of 190 tasks spanning 14 languages and 153 repositories that captures emerging threats including AI-tooling vulnerabilities. Second, we synthesize over 1,000 executable training environments, the first large-scale scaling of agentic tasks in code security. Fine-tuned Qwen3-32B improves from 5.3\% to 35.8\% on LiveCVEBench, surpassing Claude 4.5 Sonnet, with gains generalizing to Terminal Bench (12.5\% to 31.3\%). We open-source CVE-Factory, LiveCVEBench, Abacus-cve (fine-tuned model), training dataset, and leaderboard. All resources are available at https://github.com/livecvebench/CVE-Factory .

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scanner to detect sleeper agent-style backdoors in language models using memory extraction and output pattern analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in detecting backdoors that compromise the security and integrity of language models without prior knowledge of triggers or target behaviors.

Method: The authors developed a backdoor detection scanner based on memory extraction and analysis of output and attention patterns, requiring only inference operations.

Result: The scanner successfully identifies triggers across various backdoor scenarios and models, without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, effective backdoor detection mechanism that integrates into defensive frameworks without impacting model functionality.

Abstract: Detecting whether a model has been poisoned is a longstanding problem in AI security. In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.

*Yangfan Deng,Anirudh Nakra,Min Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses intellectual property protection for 3D content, focusing on watermarking techniques and proposing a framework for security evaluation with realistic threat models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of 3D content creation and its explicit parameterization make unauthorized use easier, prompting a need for secure intellectual property protection mechanisms.

Method: The paper uses a scenario-driven approach to define security objectives and adversarial models, constructing a reference framework to evaluate watermarking methods and analyze trade-offs of existing techniques.

Result: It formalizes security specifications, organizes existing methods within a framework, and assesses the legacy spread-spectrum embedding scheme while highlighting its limitations.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the importance of articulated security models and effective frameworks to advance intellectual property protection for 3D assets.

Abstract: 3D content acquisition and creation are expanding rapidly in the new era of machine learning and AI. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising high-fidelity and real-time representation for 3D content. Similar to the initial wave of digital audio-visual content at the turn of the millennium, the demand for intellectual property protection is also increasing, since explicit and editable 3D parameterization makes unauthorized use and dissemination easier. In this position paper, we argue that effective progress in watermarking 3D assets requires articulated security objectives and realistic threat models, incorporating the lessons learned from digital audio-visual asset protection over the past decades. To address this gap in security specification and evaluation, we advocate a scenario-driven formulation, in which adversarial capabilities are formalized through a security model. Based on this formulation, we construct a reference framework that organizes existing methods and clarifies how specific design choices map to corresponding adversarial assumptions. Within this framework, we also examine a legacy spread-spectrum embedding scheme, characterizing its advantages and limitations and highlighting the important trade-offs it entails. Overall, this work aims to foster effective intellectual property protection for 3D assets.

*Zhihao Li,Boyang Ma,Xuelong Dai,Minghui Xu,Yue Zhang,Biwei Yan,Kun Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes security risks in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), emphasizing mismatches between tool descriptions and implementations, which can lead to vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of description-code inconsistency in MCP Servers, which poses risks like unauthorized operations and potential misuse due to lack of transparency.

Method: The researchers designed an automated static analysis framework and examined 10,240 MCP Servers to identify inconsistencies between tool descriptions and their code behavior.

Result: The study found that 13% of servers exhibited significant mismatches, potentially allowing privileged or unauthorized actions, with trends varying by category and marketplace.

Conclusion: Description-code inconsistency poses a major security risk in MCP-based AI agents, necessitating systematic auditing and enhanced transparency for better ecosystem security.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models to invoke external tools through natural-language descriptions, forming the foundation of many AI agent applications. However, MCP does not enforce consistency between documented tool behavior and actual code execution, even though MCP Servers often run with broad system privileges. This gap introduces a largely unexplored security risk. We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency guarantees in future agent ecosystems.

### [715] [Generalizable and Interpretable RF Fingerprinting with Shapelet-Enhanced Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03035)
*Tianya Zhao,Junqing Zhang,Haowen Xu,Xiaoyan Sun,Jun Dai,Xuyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining 2D shapelets and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve the efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability of RF fingerprinting, addressing domain shift and black-box limitations of DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address two key challenges in RF fingerprinting with DNNs: domain shift (generalization issues in new environments) and the lack of interpretability due to the black-box nature of DNNs.

Method: The method integrates variable-length 2D shapelets to extract local temporal patterns from I/Q components, and a pre-trained LLM to capture long-range dependencies and global context. These models work together to enhance generalization and efficiency. Few-shot prototypes are also utilized to improve cross-domain performance without retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate superior performance in both standard and few-shot tasks, as well as improved generalization to unseen domains using the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The framework proves to be efficient, interpretable, and generalizable for RF fingerprinting. It addresses key challenges in the domain, showing robust performance across diverse datasets and scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting for wireless device authentication. However, their practical deployment faces two major limitations: domain shift, where models trained in one environment struggle to generalize to others, and the black-box nature of DNNs, which limits interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates a group of variable-length two-dimensional (2D) shapelets with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to achieve efficient, interpretable, and generalizable RF fingerprinting. The 2D shapelets explicitly capture diverse local temporal patterns across the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components, providing compact and interpretable representations. Complementarily, the pre-trained LLM captures more long-range dependencies and global contextual information, enabling strong generalization with minimal training overhead. Moreover, our framework also supports prototype generation for few-shot inference, enhancing cross-domain performance without additional retraining. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets across various protocols and domains. The results show that our method achieves superior standard and few-shot performance across both source and unseen domains.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution estimation of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial in estimating evapotranspiration, a measure of plant water use and a central quantity in agricultural applications. In this work, we develop a novel statistical method for downscaling LST data obtained from NASA's ECOSTRESS mission, using high-resolution data from the Landsat 8 mission as a proxy for modeling agricultural field structure. Using the Landsat data, we identify the boundaries of agricultural fields through edge detection techniques, allowing us to capture the inherent block structure present in the spatial domain. We propose a block-diagonal Gaussian process (BDGP) model that captures the spatial structure of the agricultural fields, leverages independence of LST across fields for computational tractability, and accounts for the change of support present in ECOSTRESS observations. We use the resulting BDGP model to perform Gaussian process regression and obtain high-resolution estimates of LST from ECOSTRESS data, along with uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method in producing reliable high-resolution LST estimates, with potential applications in agriculture, urban planning, and climate studies.

*Manuel Hofer,Markus Steinberger,Thomas Köhler*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper discusses improving novel view synthesis using a robust point-cloud estimation method that integrates a network named π^3 with regularization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenges posed by sparse-view scenarios in 3D Gaussian Splatting, especially the issues of pose accuracy and point cloud initialization.

Method: Utilizing a point-cloud estimation network (π^3) for dense initialization, complemented by a new regularization scheme involving uncertainty-guided depth supervision, normal consistency loss, and depth warping.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on established datasets including Tanks and Temples, LLFF, DTU, and MipNeRF360.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, enabling higher fidelity and robust performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has evolved rapidly, advancing from Neural Radiance Fields to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers real-time rendering and rapid training without compromising visual fidelity. However, 3DGS relies heavily on accurate camera poses and high-quality point cloud initialization, which are difficult to obtain in sparse-view scenarios. While traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines often fail in these settings, existing learning-based point estimation alternatives typically require reliable reference views and remain sensitive to pose or depth errors. In this work, we propose a robust method utilizing π^3, a reference-free point cloud estimation network. We integrate dense initialization from π^3 with a regularization scheme designed to mitigate geometric inaccuracies. Specifically, we employ uncertainty-guided depth supervision, normal consistency loss, and depth warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Tanks and Temples, LLFF, DTU, and MipNeRF360 datasets.

*Leonardo Monchieri,Elena Camuffo,Francesco Barbato,Pietro Zanuttigh,Simone Milani*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Split&Splat enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting by integrating object-consistent reconstruction and panoptic scene segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches lack object-consistent and semantically aware structure for reconstructing scenes. This creates challenges in downstream tasks.

Method: Split&Splat first propagates instance masks across multi-views using depth for view-consistent 2D masks. These are used to reconstruct each object independently, merging them back into the scene with boundary refinement and embedding instance-level semantic descriptors.

Result: Split&Splat achieves outstanding performance, notably state-of-the-art results on the ScanNetv2 segmentation benchmark, while supporting tasks like panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient and semantically aware scene reconstructions that can power downstream applications like editing, retrieval, and segmentation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables fast and high-quality scene reconstruction, but it lacks an object-consistent and semantically aware structure. We propose Split&Splat, a framework for panoptic scene reconstruction using 3DGS. Our approach explicitly models object instances. It first propagates instance masks across views using depth, thus producing view-consistent 2D masks. Each object is then reconstructed independently and merged back into the scene while refining its boundaries. Finally, instance-level semantic descriptors are embedded in the reconstructed objects, supporting various applications, including panoptic segmentation, object retrieval, and 3D editing. Unlike existing methods, Split&Splat tackles the problem by first segmenting the scene and then reconstructing each object individually. This design naturally supports downstream tasks and allows Split&Splat to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetv2 segmentation benchmark.

### [721] [Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03466)
*Adriano Macarone-Palmieri*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing quantum circuit synthesis using large language models (LLMs) with iterative improvement guided by feedback and memory mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum circuit synthesis using LLMs for better scientific design under black-box evaluation.

Method: Develop a feedback-guided optimization loop where LLM-proposed circuit edits are evaluated iteratively using the Meyer-Wallach global entanglement measure, leveraging memory and restart strategies to improve outcomes.

Result: The proposed approach enhances performance in 20-qubit and 25-qubit settings, demonstrating improved scores and illustrating specific structural properties of synthesized states.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of memory-enhanced LLM optimization for quantum circuit design, while emphasizing the importance of human-derived theoretical insights in research tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorem to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum generative models struggle with scalability and expressibility, particularly with multi-modal distributions, and the paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The authors propose combining quantum latent spaces with classical processing through a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture, utilizing Adaptive Non-Local Observables and Skip Connections for enhanced feature extraction and semantic preservation.

Result: The model successfully generates structurally coherent and recognizable images for all MNIST digit classes, though resolution limitations persist due to hardware constraints.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical architectures with adaptive observables are a promising avenue for overcoming mode collapse and enhancing generative performance in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.
