### [1] [AlphaApollo: Orchestrating Foundation Models and Professional Tools into a Self-Evolving System for Deep Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06261)
*Zhanke Zhou,Chentao Cao,Xiao Feng,Xuan Li,Zongze Li,Xiangyu Lu,Jiangchao Yao,Weikai Huang,Linrui Xu,Tian Cheng,Guanyu Jiang,Yiming Zheng,Brando Miranda,Tongliang Liu,Sanmi Koyejo,Masashi Sugiyama,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaApollo improves foundation model reasoning using professional tools and iterative solution refinement, yielding significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome intrinsic capacity limitations and unreliable test-time behaviors in foundation model reasoning.

Method: AlphaApollo integrates computation and retrieval tools, coupled with iterative refinement through a shared state map.

Result: AlphaApollo achieves performance gains: +5.15% and +23.34% gains for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and +8.91% with +26.67% gains for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.

Conclusion: AlphaApollo lifts the capability ceiling of foundation models by leveraging tools and iterative refinement successfully.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical
and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external
information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system
further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool
calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool
baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical
results and implementation details will be updated at

### [2] [Bridging Reasoning to Learning: Unmasking Illusions using Complexity Out of Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06274)
*Mohammad Mahdi Samiei Paqaleh,Arash Marioriyad,Arman Tahmasebi-Zadeh,Mohamadreza Fereydooni,Mahdi Ghaznavai,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Complexity Out of Distribution (OoD) generalization as a framework to better define and measure reasoning ability in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clear definition and metrics for reasoning ability in AI, contrasting with well-formalized generalization concepts in learning.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning complexity using Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies, and suggest methods to incorporate this framework into benchmarks, metrics, and AI training regimes.

Result: Complexity OoD provides theoretical insights into reasoning, bridging System1 and System2 processes under complexity constraints, and offers actionable recommendations for AI development.

Conclusion: Scaling AI requires explicit consideration of reasoning complexity through models, biases, and supervisory designs for robust step-wise performance.

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

### [3] [BuilderBench -- A benchmark for generalist agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06288)
*Raj Ghugare,Catherine Ji,Kathryn Wantlin,Jin Schofield,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BuilderBench, a benchmark aimed at advancing agent pre-training through open-ended exploration by requiring agents to build physical structures using blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models often fail in solving novel problems because they rely heavily on mimicry and pre-existing data; scalable mechanisms for interactive learning and exploration are needed.

Method: The authors developed BuilderBench, incorporating a hardware-accelerated simulator and a diverse task suite of 42 structures to test agents' understanding of physics, mathematics, and planning by adhering to unsupervised exploration and learning.

Result: BuilderBench was used to challenge current algorithms, revealing limitations and difficulties in embodied reasoning tasks. A "training wheels" protocol was also provided for simpler evaluation.

Conclusion: BuilderBench opens prospects for deeper research into embodied reasoning and agent exploration while highlighting the need for advanced methods capable of handling complex interactive learning tasks.

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

### [4] [Requirements for Game-Based Learning Design Framework for Information System Integration in the Context of Post-Merger Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06302)
*Ksenija Lace,Marite Kirikova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of training in information system integration during post-merger integration by proposing a game-based learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the high learning curve and low motivation observed in existing methods (AMILI and AMILP) for information system integration after mergers.

Method: Analyzing learning theories, cognitive load models, and serious game design frameworks to develop a game-based learning framework tailored for post-merger integration.

Result: Developed a two-component framework: a transformation process and the resulting learning experience. The framework will be iteratively designed and validated in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Game-based learning has the potential to improve the training for information system integration professionals, making the process more engaging and effective.

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

### [5] [Belief-Calibrated Multi-Agent Consensus Seeking for Complex NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06307)
*Wentao Deng,Jiahuan Pei,Zhiwei Xu,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen,Pengjie Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to improve multi-agent NLP systems by optimizing collaboration and consensus stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing multi-agent systems used in NLP tasks, which rely on uniform collaboration and voting mechanisms, causing instability and suboptimal consensus.

Method: The Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework is proposed, focusing on selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the consensus judgment using system-internal beliefs.

Result: Experiments show that BCCS achieves significant accuracy improvements: 2.23% on MATH and 3.95% on MMLU benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The BCCS framework enhances stable consensus for NLP tasks in multi-agent systems, providing better results and addressing previous limitations like indiscriminate collaboration and stability issues.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

### [6] [Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies whether reasoning LLMs trained solo can excel at off-trajectory reasoning, revealing limitations in their recoverability and guidability during collaborations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential and limitations of reasoning LLMs collaborating effectively by assessing their ability to recover from distractions and use guidance.

Method: Twin tests evaluating Recoverability and Guidability, experiments on 15 reasoning LLMs, and control studies combining distillation teachers, RL, and data choices.

Result: Stronger LLMs are more fragile under distraction and fail to capitalize on collaborative guidance under hard problems, achieving under 9.2% solve rates.

Conclusion: Reasoning LLMs trained solo show limitations when collaborating and require tailored strategies to boost multi-model reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

### [7] [Flavonoid Fusion: Creating a Knowledge Graph to Unveil the Interplay Between Food and Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06433)
*Aryan Singh Dalal,Yinglun Zhang,Duru Doğan,Atalay Mert İleri,Hande Küçük McGinty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge graph to link food and health, focusing on relationships like flavonoid content and cancer connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on representing food-health relationships in a standardized, machine-readable format.

Method: Used the KNARM methodology to structure data from USDA databases and cancer studies in a knowledge graph.

Result: Developed a knowledge graph linking flavonoids in food and their connections to cancer research.

Conclusion: The knowledge graph acts as a foundational tool to explore food-health relationships. Future work entails expanding data scope and uncovering hidden connections.

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

### [8] [PuzzlePlex: Benchmarking Foundation Models on Reasoning and Planning with Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06475)
*Yitao Long,Yuru Jiang,Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Jingchen Sun,Yiqiu Shen,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan,Dennis Shasha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to test reasoning and planning abilities of foundation models using diverse puzzles, and evaluates their performance in instruction-based and code-based settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the reasoning, planning, and generalization capabilities of foundation models, especially in complex and dynamic situations.

Method: The authors introduce PuzzlePlex, a set of 15 puzzle types with deterministic and stochastic games, providing environments for targeted evaluation of models. They also implement fine-grained metrics and compare customized game-playing strategies.

Result: Reasoning models perform better in instruction-based setups whereas code-based approaches, though more challenging, offer efficient scalability.

Conclusion: PuzzlePlex serves as a valuable benchmark for evaluating and enhancing foundation models' reasoning, planning, and scalability in complex tasks.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

### [9] [Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06534)
*Jiahe Jin,Abhijay Paladugu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reasoning-driven pipeline for agentic search using LLMs and identifies key reasoning behaviors. It proposes Behavior Priming for training models, leading to improved search performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for handling complex, multi-step information retrieval tasks effectively.

Method: The authors propose Behavior Priming, integrating synthesized reasoning behaviors into a model via supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments reveal over 35% performance improvements for two models using Behavior Priming compared to direct training, emphasizing reasoning behavior over answer correctness.

Conclusion: Integrating desirable reasoning behaviors during training enhances exploratory and scaling abilities in agentic search, optimizing final performance post-reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

### [10] [Auto-Prompt Ensemble for LLM Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06538)
*Jiajie Li,Huayi Zhang,Peng Lin,Jinjun Xiong,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) framework to enhance the reliability of LLM judges by incorporating adaptive evaluation dimensions via confidence-based mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM judges often fail to capture critical implicit standards in human assessments, limiting their reliability in evaluations.

Method: The proposed Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) automatically identifies evaluation gaps using failure cases and employs a confidence-based ensemble system to determine the adoption of auxiliary dimensions through Collective Confidence estimation.

Result: Experiments show that APE improves GPT-4's agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in zero-shot settings and enhances reliability across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: APE offers a structured method to adaptively refine LLM evaluations, closing the gap between machine and human assessments in diverse settings.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

### [11] [WebDART: Dynamic Decomposition and Re-planning for Complex Web Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06587)
*Jingbo Yang,Bairu Hou,Wei Wei,Shiyu Chang,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebDART enhances large language model (LLM) agents for handling complex web chores by dynamic task decomposition and continuous re-planning, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLM agents to tackle long horizon navigation, large-scale information extraction, and reasoning tasks on the web.

Method: WebDART introduces dynamic decomposition into navigation, information extraction, and execution subtasks, and incorporates continuous re-planning as webpages are explored.

Result: WebDART improves success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points compared to previous state-of-the-art and reduces navigation steps by up to 14.7.

Conclusion: WebDART demonstrates the potential of dynamic task decomposition and adaptive planning in overcoming the limitations of current web agents, marking progress in web task automation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

### [12] [Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06600)
*Zhaochun Ren,Zhou Yang,Chenglong Ye,Haizhou Sun,Chao Chen,Xiaofei Zhu,Xiangwen Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies shortcomings in In-Context Learning (ICL) for fine-grained emotion recognition and introduces Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL) to improve reasoning and decision processes using emotionally similar examples and exclusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance fine-grained emotion recognition by addressing overlooked issues in decision-making processes, which are critical for improving prediction accuracy.

Method: Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL) employs emotionally similar examples and dynamic soft-label strategies to refine query representations. A two-stage exclusion strategy optimizes decision-making by evaluating similarity from multiple perspectives.

Result: EICL significantly outperformed ICL on various datasets used in the experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The study concludes that EICL improves both the reasoning and decision-making processes in fine-grained emotion recognition, offering a substantial advancement over previous ICL methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework for leveraging human feedback to improve LLM-based customer support systems efficiently and continuously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies of standard offline data annotation methods and minimize the time-consuming retraining cycles in LLM-based customer support systems.

Method: The AITL framework integrates four types of live feedback annotations (response preferences, agent rationales, knowledge relevance, and identifying knowledge gaps) into real-time operations to iteratively update models.

Result: The AITL framework demonstrated improved retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality (+8.4% helpfulness), and increased agent adoption (+4.5%) during pilot testing.

Conclusion: Embedding human feedback into live workflows significantly enhances the performance and iterative improvement of LLM-based customer support systems.

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

### [14] [Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06711)
*Batu El,Mert Yuksekgonul,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates challenges in using meta-agents for automated agent design and proposes improvements to learning methods, diversity of designs, and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To innovate in agentic systems through automated architecture design using meta-agents and address existing inefficiencies and limitations.

Method: The authors analyze challenges using evolutionary approaches for iterative learning, assess behavioral diversity among designed agents, and evaluate cost-effectiveness compared to human-designed agents.

Result: Using evolutionary techniques improves performance, but behavioral diversity among designs remains limited. Automated design shows cost benefits only in specific datasets and deployment scales.

Conclusion: Automated agent design needs more efficient learning methods, improved diversity, and better cost efficiency for widespread adoption.

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The MultiCNKG framework combines three key knowledge bases (CNKG, GO, DO) with large language models, like GPT-4, to create an integrated knowledge graph for biomedical and cognitive sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in capturing complex semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes using traditional machine learning methods.

Method: Merged Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph, Gene Ontology, and Disease Ontology using GPT-4 for entity alignment, semantic similarity, and graph augmentation.

Result: Generated MultiCNKG, encompassing 6.9K nodes and 11.3K edges, with strong metrics in precision (85.2%), recall (87.3%), and graph consistency (82.5%). Competitive results in link prediction evaluations versus benchmarks.

Conclusion: MultiCNKG enhances personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis generation in neuroscience by offering a cohesive, multi-layered understanding of molecular to behavioral domains.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

### [16] [Verifying Memoryless Sequential Decision-making of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06756)
*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tool to verify Large Language Model (LLM)-based policies in decision-making tasks by analyzing reachable states and validating safety properties using formal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure the safety and reliability of LLM-based policies in sequential decision-making tasks, which are increasingly being deployed but lack formal verification tools.

Method: The method involves constructing reachable parts of a decision-making MDP guided by LLM actions, converting states into prompts for LLMs, and using formal model checking (via Storm) to validate safety properties.

Result: Experiments reveal that open-source LLMs can be verified when actions are deterministically seeded, but they perform worse than traditional deep reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: The approach lays a foundation for formally verifying LLM capabilities in sequential tasks and integrates with existing tools, although current LLMs show limitations compared to established baselines.

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

*Zhi Zhang,Yan Liu,Zhejing Hu,Gong Chen,Sheng-hua Zhong,Jiannong Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework to automate scientific research generation by leveraging professor and doctoral student agents to evolve and execute research plans, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of automating the end-to-end scientific research process, which requires both high-level planning and dynamic execution under uncertain conditions.

Method: The proposed Double-Loop Multi-Agent framework consists of a leader loop (professor agents employing evolutionary algorithms) to evolve research plans and a follower loop (doctoral student agents dynamically executing plans) through adjustments informed by contextual observations.

Result: Experiments show DLMA achieves state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory, surpassing strong baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of both loops for producing novel and sound research.

Conclusion: The DLMA framework effectively automates scientific research generation, demonstrating the critical interplay of plan evolution and dynamic execution, with promising results for automating complex tasks.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes ATF (Autoformalizer with Tool Feedback), a new model for improving the translation of mathematical problems from natural to formal language, using tools for syntax and consistency validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of data for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) and the challenges of generating valid formal statements that meet both syntactic validity and semantic consistency.

Method: ATF uses Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and a multi-LLMs-as-judge approach for consistency validation. It is trained in phases: a cold-start phase with synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase, and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: ATF significantly outperforms existing baseline formalizer models in terms of syntactic validity and semantic consistency, as confirmed by both experimental and human evaluations. It also demonstrates strong inference scaling.

Conclusion: The introduced ATF sets a new benchmark in autoformalization, and the authors also provide Numina-ATF, a large dataset, to support further research in this domain.

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

### [19] [TGPR: Tree-Guided Policy Refinement for Robust Self-Debugging of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06878)
*Daria Ozerova,Ekaterina Trofimova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), combining Thompson-Sampling-based tree search with GRPO to improve iterative refinement in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative refinement methods rely on predefined heuristics, which struggle with exploration versus exploitation dilemmas and lack adaptability based on prior outcomes.

Method: TGPR integrates Thompson-Sampling-based tree search with GRPO, exploring both failed and successful paths actively to develop more adaptive policies.

Result: TGPR achieved up to +4.2 percentage points improvement in pass@1 on MBPP and +12.51 percentage points improvement in pass@10 on APPS benchmarks compared to GRPO baselines.

Conclusion: TGPR offers a principled framework with learned policies and structured search methods, enhancing iterative refinement and reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

### [20] [LLM-Assisted Modeling of Semantic Web-Enabled Multi-Agents Systems with AJAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06911)
*Hacane Hechehouche,Andre Antakli,Matthias Klusch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The AJAN framework enables engineering multi-agent systems using semantic Web standards, employing RDF/RDFS and SPARQL for knowledge representation and behavior modeling. This paper introduces an IDE that incorporates Large Language Models to simplify modeling and expand user accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agent knowledge and behavior modeling using RDF/RDFS and SPARQL in AJAN faces challenges like error-prone URI handling and the complexity of large-scale SPARQL queries, necessitating an easier approach to broaden its usage.

Method: The paper proposes an integrated development environment (IDE) that utilizes Large Language Models to facilitate modeling of AJAN agents and mitigate existing hurdles.

Result: The IDE provides an improved user experience for AJAN framework modelers, enabling easier handling of URIs and complex SPARQL queries and broadening accessibility for agents' engineering.

Conclusion: The integration of Large Language Models into the AJAN framework's IDE addresses key challenges for agent engineers, mitigating complexities and improving adoption among a broader user community.

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

### [21] [Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06953)
*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how uniform information density (UID) in reasoning traces affects reasoning quality in large language models, proposing new metrics and showing their practical benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether uniformity in information density at the step level in reasoning traces can indicate or improve the quality of reasoning in large language models.

Method: Proposed an entropy-based stepwise information density metric along with two uniformity measures (local and global). Conducted experiments on six reasoning benchmarks to evaluate these metrics.

Result: The study found that reasoning traces with uniform information density improve accuracy significantly (10-32% relative gains). Uniformity is linked with correct reasoning traces, while irregular spikes are often associated with errors.

Conclusion: Uniform information density is a strong predictor of reasoning quality and a valuable tool for improving reasoning systems in large language models.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

*Wenxun Wu,Yuanyang Li,Guhan Chen,Linyue Wang,Hongyang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO) integrates multi-hop reasoning and tool usage into language models, improving their performance in tasks requiring external knowledge and complex computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models face challenges in tasks that require up-to-date external knowledge or computational tools such as calculators or code interpreters. The paper addresses this gap to improve task performance.

Method: The authors propose TAPO, a reinforcement learning framework based on Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), tailored for adaptive tool invocation during reasoning processes. Two datasets, TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K, are introduced for evaluating this approach.

Result: TAPO outperformed baseline methods in reasoning and computational task accuracy on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models. It achieved efficient tool usage while mitigating issues like excessive tool calls.

Conclusion: The integration of reasoning and tool usage in TAPO marks a substantial step forward in addressing tasks demanding both advanced computation and external knowledge, showcasing its potential to enhance language model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

### [23] [Prompt Optimization Across Multiple Agents for Representing Diverse Human Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07064)
*Manh Hung Nguyen,Sebastian Tschiatschek,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to use multiple LLM agents, instead of one, to better represent human behavioral diversity, and employs submodular optimization for selecting these agents effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relying on LLMs for modeling human behavior is attractive due to difficulty and cost of large-scale human data collection, but LLMs often fail to capture the diversity of human behavior.

Method: The method involves creating multiple LLM agents conditioned on human demonstrations through in-context learning and selecting a representative set of them using submodular optimization techniques.

Result: Experiments in crowdsourcing and education domains showed that the proposed approach better represented human populations than baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework and submodular optimization method successfully allow LLM agents to capture human behavior diversity effectively, offering promise for applications in human-centered tasks.

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for inductive reasoning in possibilistic logic programs and demonstrates their effectiveness through algorithms and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While possibilistic logic programs under stable models have been studied extensively, their inductive reasoning properties have not been explored. The paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: The authors introduce formal definitions of induction tasks, explore their properties, and propose two algorithms, ilpsm and ilpsmmin, for computing induction solutions. An implementation of ilpsmmin is provided.

Result: Experimental results reveal that the ilpsmmin algorithm outperforms an existing inductive learning system for ordinary logic programs in randomly generated datasets.

Conclusion: The approach and algorithms developed in this paper successfully address inductive reasoning challenges in possibilistic logic programming and present a promising alternative to existing systems in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VRPAgent, a framework combining LLM-generated components with genetic search to develop heuristics for vehicle routing problems, outperforming handcrafted and learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexity of crafting high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems by utilizing advancements in LLM-based code generation.

Method: VRPAgent integrates LLM-generated problem-specific operators into a generic metaheuristic framework and refines them using a novel genetic search approach.

Result: VRPAgent discovered heuristic operators outperforming handcrafted and learning-based methods in various vehicle routing problems, using only a single CPU core.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that LLM-based frameworks can surpass state-of-the-art handcrafted and learning-based heuristics, paving the way for automated heuristic discovery in VRPs.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

*Baixuan Xu,Tianshi Zheng,Zhaowei Wang,Hong Ting Tsang,Weiqi Wang,Tianqing Fang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares action representation methods for long-horizon autonomy in AI, focusing on 'Planning with Actions' (PwA) and 'Planning with Schemas' (PwS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in designing scalable, effective action representations for open-world AI tasks characterized by long-horizon planning.

Method: The authors investigate two action representation methods (PwA and PwS), qualitatively analyze them using a cognitive bandwidth framework, and conduct controlled experiments across different environments and model capacities.

Result: A representation-choice inflection point was observed: PwS becomes optimal as action space expands. Model capacity affects the location of this inflection point.

Conclusion: PwS is a scalable alternative to PwA, but improvements are needed for PwS agents to achieve optimal autonomy in complex environments.

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

### [27] [The Contingencies of Physical Embodiment Allow for Open-Endedness and Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07117)
*Leonardo Christov-Moore,Arthur Juliani,Alex Kiefer,Nicco Reggente,B. Scott Rousse,Adam Safron,Nicol'as Hinrichs,Daniel Polani,Antonio Damasio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the conditions of physical embodiment, inspired by existentialist philosophy, to develop adaptive artificial agents capable of surviving and caring in open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand why biological entities excel in survival and care in open-ended environments to develop robust and aligned artificial agents, overcoming obstacles like vulnerability and lack of adaptivity.

Method: Two conditions are defined for embodiment: 'being-in-the-world' and 'being-towards-death', leading to homeostatic and intrinsic drives. These concepts are formalized using reinforcement learning to study their effects.

Result: The framework enables agents to maximize control over future states and enhance their capacity to meet homeostatic needs in multi-agent settings.

Conclusion: Embodied artificial agents guided by existentialist-inspired drives hold potential for achieving open-ended adaptivity and fostering care in complex environments.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

*Ali Norouzifar,Humam Kourani,Marcus Dees,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interactive framework to enhance process discovery by integrating domain knowledge, expressed in natural language and processed via LLMs, with event log data, delivering more trustworthy process models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of inaccurate process models derived solely from event data, which often lack reliability due to noise, incompleteness, and the disregard of domain knowledge.

Method: The authors use Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract declarative rules from domain knowledge expressed in natural language. These rules are then used to guide the IMr discovery algorithm in constructing process models. The framework coordinates interactions among LLMs, domain experts, and backend services, supported by a fully implemented tool.

Result: An extensive evaluation, including a real-life case study with domain experts, demonstrated the framework's usability and effectiveness. Multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies were tested.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge via LLMs into the process discovery pipeline improves the reliability of process models, making them more suitable for downstream conformance checking and process improvement tasks.

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NewtonBench addresses key gaps in benchmarking scientific law discovery by introducing 324 interactive tasks across physics domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to balance scientific relevance, scalability, and memorization resistance, and oversimplify the discovery process.

Method: NewtonBench employs metaphysical shifts to create scalable, non-memorization-prone tasks and introduces interactive model systems for discovery evaluation.

Result: LLMs show fragile scientific discovery abilities, degrading with system complexity and observational noise. Tool assistance can paradoxically hinder model performance.

Conclusion: Robust AI-driven scientific discovery in complex environments remains a challenge. NewtonBench is a critical testbed for advancing AI development in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

### [30] [Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Lexicographic Cost Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07276)
*Pulkit Rustagi,Kyle Hollins Wray,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a lexicographic framework and the Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) algorithm to address multi-objective multi-agent path finding (MO-MAPF) problems by directly optimizing user preferences, avoiding Pareto frontier complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of MO-MAPF in shared environments, where agents need to balance trade-offs between multiple objectives, while addressing limitations like poor scalability and lack of user-preference optimization in existing algorithms.

Method: The authors developed LCBS, which integrates a priority-aware low-level A* search with conflict-based search, focusing on user-defined lexicographic preferences rather than Pareto frontiers.

Result: LCBS successfully computes optimal solutions and scales efficiently, handling instances with up to ten objectives. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in success rates and scalability, especially as objectives increase.

Conclusion: LCBS is an effective and scalable solution for MO-MAPF problems, achieving optimality and aligning with user preferences, while overcoming traditional limitations in multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses a generative AI-based workflow developed for media researchers to efficiently query NFL historical plays using natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance content discovery and management for media researchers by streamlining access to historical NFL plays via a natural language-based solution.

Method: The workflow takes natural language queries, decomposes them into elements, translates this into database query language, and implements semantic caching to improve accuracy and latency.

Result: The system achieved over 95% accuracy and reduced the average search time for relevant videos from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.

Conclusion: The solution significantly improved operational efficiency and empowered users to focus on creative and engaging content production.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the memory wall in AI and other applications, proposing UCIe-enabled memory designs for higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current on-package memory solutions fall short in meeting power-efficient bandwidth demands.

Method: Propose reusing existing LPDDR6 and HBM memory via a logic die connected to SoC using UCIe, or natively supporting UCIe in DRAM dies.

Result: Achieve up to 10x higher bandwidth density, 3x lower latency, 3x lower power, and reduced costs compared to traditional solutions.

Conclusion: UCIe-based memory solutions are more efficient and cost-effective, addressing current memory limitations for computing applications like AI.

Abstract: Emerging computing applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are
facing a memory wall with existing on-package memory solutions that are unable
to meet the power-efficient bandwidth demands. We propose to enhance UCIe with
memory semantics to deliver power-efficient bandwidth and cost-effective
on-package memory solutions applicable across the entire computing continuum.
We propose approaches by reusing existing LPDDR6 and HBM memory through a logic
die that connects to the SoC using UCIe. We also propose an approach where the
DRAM die natively supports UCIe instead of the LPDDR6 bus interface. Our
approaches result in significantly higher bandwidth density (up to 10x), lower
latency (up to 3x), lower power (up to 3x), and lower cost compared to existing
HBM4 and LPDDR on-package memory solutions.

*Leshu Li,Jiayin Qin,Jie Peng,Zishen Wan,Huaizhi Qu,Ye Han,Pingqing Zheng,Hongsen Zhang,Yu,Cao,Tianlong Chen,Yang,Zhao*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RTGS, a framework to optimize 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems for real-time performance on resource-constrained edge devices. It achieves notable energy efficiency and maintains high rendering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for its rendering efficiency and accuracy in SLAM systems, but its computationally intensive nature prevents its adoption in edge devices.

Method: RTGS implements algorithm-hardware co-design, including Gaussian pruning and dynamic downsampling on the algorithm side, and strategies like subtile-level streaming, pairwise scheduling, and specialized hardware units (WSU, GMU, R&B buffer) on the hardware side to optimize pipeline redundancies.

Result: RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) across four datasets and three algorithms, with energy efficiency improvements of up to 82.5x compared to the baseline and minimal quality degradation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the feasibility of deploying 3DGS-based SLAM systems on edge devices, achieving both efficiency and quality, thus bridging the performance gap for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems can largely benefit from 3DGS's state-of-the-art rendering
efficiency and accuracy, but have not yet been adopted in resource-constrained
edge devices due to insufficient speed. Addressing this, we identify notable
redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually
straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead
associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we
propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively
reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the
overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline.
On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to
remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during
backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses
the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant
pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy
and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload
imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration
information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates
the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during
rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory
accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation.
Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on
four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the
baseline and negligible quality loss. Code is available at

*Bindu G Gowda,Yogesh Goyal,Yash Gupta,Madhav Rao*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper investigates using approximate FP32 multipliers to enhance hardware efficiency for CNN inference while maintaining acceptable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP32 multiplication is resource-intensive, and perfect accuracy is not always required for applications like neural network inference.

Method: The paper employs error-variant approximate compressors for mantissa multiplication, optimizes CNN performance by interleaving differently approximated multipliers within convolutional layers, and uses the NSGA-II algorithm for strategic placement.

Result: The approach significantly reduces hardware costs while balancing computational accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: Approximate FP32 multiplication offers a practical solution for improving area, power, and speed efficiency in CNN inference, with minimal accuracy loss through intelligently optimized multiplier placement.

Abstract: Single-precision floating point (FP32) data format, defined by the IEEE 754
standard, is widely employed in scientific computing, signal processing, and
deep learning training, where precision is critical. However, FP32
multiplication is computationally expensive and requires complex hardware,
especially for precisely handling mantissa multiplication. In practical
applications like neural network inference, perfect accuracy is not always
necessary, minor multiplication errors often have little impact on final
accuracy. This enables trading precision for gains in area, power, and speed.
This work focuses on CNN inference using approximate FP32 multipliers, where
the mantissa multiplication is approximated by employing error-variant
approximate compressors, that significantly reduce hardware cost. Furthermore,
this work optimizes CNN performance by employing differently approximated FP32
multipliers and studying their impact when interleaved within the kernels
across the convolutional layers. The placement and ordering of these
approximate multipliers within each kernel are carefully optimized using the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, balancing the trade-off between
accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy issues in machine learning through an innovative approach called Cocoon, combining software and hardware optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to mitigate privacy issues where machine learning models memorize and leak sensitive training data, requiring better methods than current differential privacy approaches.

Method: A novel framework called Cocoon is introduced, leveraging hardware-software co-design. It precomputes and stores correlated noises efficiently (Cocoon-Emb) and uses custom processing devices for larger models (Cocoon-NMP).

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance gains on an FPGA-based prototype with improvements of up to 10.82x for embedding table models and up to 3.06x for large models.

Conclusion: Cocoon is an effective approach for privacy-preserving ML training, addressing accuracy degradation and performance overhead issues posed by existing differential privacy methods.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious
privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy
(DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However,
DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of
the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds
carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other
across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these
new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they
incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding
tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software
co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon
accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing
correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models
through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system
with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by
2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).

*Jiqun Pan,Zhenke Duan,Jiani Tu,Anzhi Cheng,Yanqing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KG-MASD, a novel approach to enhance industrial QA systems by integrating reasoning depth and verifiability through knowledge-graph-guided distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial QA systems must ensure safety and reliability in high-risk scenarios, as errors can lead to catastrophic consequences. Existing methods lack the ability to produce reliable and easily deployable lightweight models.

Method: The proposed KG-MASD leverages a knowledge graph as a structured prior and formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process, ensuring enriched state representation, convergence, and collaborative reasoning.

Result: KG-MASD achieves up to 20.1 per cent higher accuracy over baseline methods and significantly enhances reliability on an industrial QA dataset, making it suitable for deployment in critical applications.

Conclusion: The KG-MASD method successfully combines reasoning depth and verifiability into compact, deployable models, presenting a trustworthy AI solution for safety-critical industrial use cases.

Abstract: Industrial question-answering (QA) systems require higher safety and
reliability than general-purpose dialogue models, as errors in high-risk
scenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis can have severe consequences.
Although multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer
from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional
distillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities
to lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we
propose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our
approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates
a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state
representation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning
with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning
data and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact
student models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA
dataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent
over baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI
deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios. Code and data are available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage evaluation framework for analyzing human-written survey responses using LLM capabilities to enhance quality assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address low-quality open-ended survey responses that can mislead conclusions in marketing research using a more robust evaluation method.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage evaluation framework including gibberish filtering and dimension evaluation (effort, relevance, completeness) with LLM capabilities.

Result: Validation on English and Korean datasets shows superior performance compared to existing metrics, with strong correlation to expert assessments and practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the quality assessment process for human survey responses and is applicable in real-world scenarios for prediction and rejection of responses.

Abstract: Open-ended survey responses provide valuable insights in marketing research,
but low-quality responses not only burden researchers with manual filtering but
also risk leading to misleading conclusions, underscoring the need for
effective evaluation. Existing automatic evaluation methods target
LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written responses with their
distinct characteristics. To address such characteristics, we propose a
two-stage evaluation framework specifically designed for human survey
responses. First, gibberish filtering removes nonsensical responses. Then,
three dimensions-effort, relevance, and completeness-are evaluated using LLM
capabilities, grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data.
Validation on English and Korean datasets shows that our framework not only
outperforms existing metrics but also demonstrates high practical applicability
for real-world applications such as response quality prediction and response
rejection, showing strong correlations with expert assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating language and image comprehension, particularly for complex query cases in multimodal models.

Method: Proposes chain-of-thought (CoT) structured training, restructures and annotates training data, integrates detection and segmentation into a unified framework, and employs an adaptive weighted loss.

Result: Demonstrates a 2.5%+ accuracy improvement on curated benchmarks and RefCOCO/+/g datasets over baseline models.

Conclusion: The CoT Referring strategy effectively improves multimodal reasoning, addressing complex referring expression challenges and setting stronger benchmarks for MLLMs.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for
assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension,
serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy, CoT
Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a
structured, chain-of-thought training data structure. Our approach
systematically parses textual structures to a sequential referring step, where
in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference
alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We
restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new
annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from
existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring
cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified
MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize
performance. Experimental results on our curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a notable increase of 2.5%+
over baseline models.

TL;DR: The paper aims to identify the best word representation and tokenization methods specifically for scientific data and create a comprehensive evaluation suite to test these approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The importance of finding optimal word representation algorithms stems from the varied contextual meanings of words in domain-specific texts, such as scientific literature.

Method: The researchers developed an evaluation suite comprising various downstream tasks and datasets tailored to the scientific domain. They tested multiple word representation and tokenization algorithms using this suite.

Result: The study established an evaluation framework for scientific NLP tasks and assessed several word representation and tokenization methods for their effectiveness in handling scientific text.

Conclusion: The paper provides a valuable tool for evaluating word representation and tokenization algorithms in the scientific domain, paving the way for improved NLP tasks in specialized fields.

Abstract: Finding an optimal word representation algorithm is particularly important in
terms of domain specific data, as the same word can have different meanings and
hence, different representations depending on the domain and context. While
Generative AI and transformer architecture does a great job at generating
contextualized embeddings for any given work, they are quite time and compute
extensive, especially if we were to pre-train such a model from scratch. In
this work, we focus on the scientific domain and finding the optimal word
representation algorithm along with the tokenization method that could be used
to represent words in the scientific domain. The goal of this research is two
fold: 1) finding the optimal word representation and tokenization methods that
can be used in downstream scientific domain NLP tasks, and 2) building a
comprehensive evaluation suite that could be used to evaluate various word
representation and tokenization algorithms (even as new ones are introduced) in
the scientific domain. To this end, we build an evaluation suite consisting of
several downstream tasks and relevant datasets for each task. Furthermore, we
use the constructed evaluation suite to test various word representation and
tokenization algorithms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces TRepLiNa, a method combining CKA and REPINA, to enhance translation quality in decoder-only multilingual large language models for India's low-resource languages (LRLs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India has numerous low-resource languages (LRLs), lacking adequate linguistic tools for effective translation to high-resource languages (HRLs). Addressing this issue can greatly benefit linguistic diversity and communication.

Method: The paper introduces TRepLiNa, which integrates Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) for cross-lingual similarity and REPINA for regularization to stabilize training, applied in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios using the Aya-23 8B model.

Result: Experiments reveal that TRepLiNa significantly improves translation from low-resource languages (LRLs) to high-resource languages in resource-scarce settings.

Conclusion: TRepLiNa demonstrates the potential for enhancing low-resource language translation effectively and efficiently, paving the way for addressing linguistic gaps in India, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: The 2025 Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact
(MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic
gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In
this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in
specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model
(LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL).
Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric
that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a
regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the
pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research
project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using
Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari,
Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning
mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach
to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) reliably by Large Language Models, especially across diverse regulatory and multilingual contexts.

Method: The researchers used a phased human-in-the-loop annotation methodology that combines linguistic expertise with quality assurance. They employed metrics like inter-annotator agreement and root-cause analysis to refine annotation processes.

Result: The framework achieved significant improvements in recall and false positive rates, creating consistent high-fidelity datasets suitable for LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Iterative and analytics-driven multilingual PII annotation pipelines are critical for improving data quality, enhancing model reliability, and overcoming annotation challenges in multilingual settings.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption, ensuring their reliable
handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across diverse regulatory
contexts has become essential. This work introduces a scalable multilingual
data curation framework designed for high-quality PII annotation across 13
underrepresented locales, covering approximately 336 locale-specific PII types.
Our phased, human-in-the-loop annotation methodology combines linguistic
expertise with rigorous quality assurance, leading to substantial improvements
in recall and false positive rates from pilot, training, and production phases.
By leveraging inter-annotator agreement metrics and root-cause analysis, the
framework systematically uncovers and resolves annotation inconsistencies,
resulting in high-fidelity datasets suitable for supervised LLM fine-tuning.
Beyond reporting empirical gains, we highlight common annotator challenges in
multilingual PII labeling and demonstrate how iterative, analytics-driven

Result: Generated a dataset enabling analysis of trait distributions, correlations, predictive modeling, and serving as a reference for further research.

Conclusion: The dataset facilitates computational intelligence and Ayurvedic studies while aiding in the development of intelligent health applications.

Abstract: This dataset provides responses to a standardized, bilingual (English-Hindi)
Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire designed to evaluate the physical,
physiological, and psychological characteristics of individuals according to
classical Ayurvedic principles. The questionnaire consists of 24
multiple-choice items covering body features, appetite, sleep patterns, energy
levels, and temperament. It was developed following AYUSH/CCRAS guidelines to
ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection. All questions are mandatory
and neutrally phrased to minimize bias, and dosha labels (Vata, Pitta, Kapha)
are hidden from participants. Data were collected via a Google Forms
deployment, enabling automated scoring of responses to map individual traits to
dosha-specific scores. The resulting dataset provides a structured platform for
research in computational intelligence, Ayurvedic studies, and personalized
health analytics, supporting analysis of trait distributions, correlations, and
predictive modeling. It can also serve as a reference for future Prakriti-based
studies and the development of intelligent health applications.

*Jiajun Wu,Swaleh Zaidi,Braden Teitge,Henry Leung,Jiayu Zhou,Jessalyn Holodinsky,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system for offline summarization of EHRs on embedded devices was developed, providing critical insights quickly and preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge emergency physicians face when processing overwhelming unstructured clinical data in EHRs, and to provide secure, offline solutions that preserve patient privacy.

Method: A two-stage architecture using NVIDIA Jetson devices, where a retrieval stage identifies relevant portions of EHRs, and a small language model generates concise summaries. The system operates entirely offline.

Result: The system showed effective performance on MIMIC-IV and real EHR datasets, delivering summaries in less than 30 seconds with evaluated quality metrics like factual accuracy and completeness.

Conclusion: The proposed system can aid clinicians by delivering quick, accurate summaries offline, preserving privacy, and being feasible for embedded device deployment.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain extensive unstructured clinical data
that can overwhelm emergency physicians trying to identify critical
information. We present a two-stage summarization system that runs entirely on
embedded devices, enabling offline clinical summarization while preserving
patient privacy. In our approach, a dual-device architecture first retrieves
relevant patient record sections using the Jetson Nano-R (Retrieve), then
generates a structured summary on another Jetson Nano-S (Summarize),
communicating via a lightweight socket link. The summarization output is
two-fold: (1) a fixed-format list of critical findings, and (2) a
context-specific narrative focused on the clinician's query. The retrieval
stage uses locally stored EHRs, splits long notes into semantically coherent
sections, and searches for the most relevant sections per query. The generation
stage uses a locally hosted small language model (SLM) to produce the summary
from the retrieved text, operating within the constraints of two NVIDIA Jetson
devices. We first benchmarked six open-source SLMs under 7B parameters to
identify viable models. We incorporated an LLM-as-Judge evaluation mechanism to
assess summary quality in terms of factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and de-identified real EHRs demonstrate that
our fully offline system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30
seconds.

*Aisha Alansari,Hamzah Luqman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys hallucination in large language models (LLMs), exploring causes, detection methods, and mitigation strategies, providing a taxonomy and analysis of current challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of hallucination in LLMs, as it undermines their reliability and trustworthiness in delivering accurate information.

Method: The authors systematically review research on hallucination, creating taxonomies for hallucination types, detection methods, and mitigation strategies, while also evaluating benchmarks and metrics.

Result: Key insights into the root causes of hallucinations, analysis of current techniques for detection and mitigation, and identification of open challenges are provided.

Conclusion: The paper lays a foundation for advancing more truthful and trustworthy LLMs by identifying gaps and offering directions for future research on hallucination.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, their
impressive fluency often comes at the cost of producing false or fabricated
information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Hallucination refers to the
generation of content by an LLM that is fluent and syntactically correct but
factually inaccurate or unsupported by external evidence. Hallucinations
undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, especially in domains
requiring factual accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive review of
research on hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on causes, detection, and
mitigation. We first present a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze
their root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle, from data
collection and architecture design to inference. We further examine how
hallucinations emerge in key natural language generation tasks. Building on
this foundation, we introduce a structured taxonomy of detection approaches and
another taxonomy of mitigation strategies. We also analyze the strengths and
limitations of current detection and mitigation approaches and review existing
evaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations.
Finally, we outline key open challenges and promising directions for future
research, providing a foundation for the development of more truthful and
trustworthy LLMs.

*Rohitash Chandra,Yathin Suresh,Divyansh Raj Sinha,Sanchit Jindal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes the rise in abusive and sexually explicit content in US Billboard music lyrics over seven decades using deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and validate the growing trend of explicit content in music for better policy development, considering the negative behavioral effects on children and youth.

Method: Deep learning and language models were utilized to analyze lyrics, with sentiment analysis and abuse detection applied to measure explicit content longitudinally.

Result: A significant increase in explicit content, including profanity and sexually explicit language, was observed in popular music, particularly since the 1990s.

Conclusion: Music lyrics demonstrate evolving societal norms, with deep learning proving useful in capturing changes in lyrical content over time.

Abstract: There is no doubt that there has been a drastic increase in abusive and
sexually explicit content in music, particularly in Billboard Music Charts.
However, there is a lack of studies that validate the trend for effective
policy development, as such content has harmful behavioural changes in children
and youths. In this study, we utilise deep learning methods to analyse songs
(lyrics) from Billboard Charts of the United States in the last seven decades.
We provide a longitudinal study using deep learning and language models and
review the evolution of content using sentiment analysis and abuse detection,
including sexually explicit content. Our results show a significant rise in
explicit content in popular music from 1990 onwards. Furthermore, we find an
increasing prevalence of songs with lyrics containing profane, sexually
explicit, and otherwise inappropriate language. The longitudinal analysis of
the ability of language models to capture nuanced patterns in lyrical content,
reflecting shifts in societal norms and language use over time.

*Ranjan Mishra,Julian I. Bibo,Quinten van Engelen,Henk Schaapman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study replicates Ma et al.'s 'XRec' framework using Llama 3 instead of GPT-3.5-turbo, analyzing effectiveness in recommendation explanations and extending findings on embedding stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and replicate the XRec framework's ability to generate explainable recommendations using a different large language model (Llama 3) and to further explore its embedding mechanisms.

Method: Reproduce the original study using Llama 3 as the LLM, modify input/output embeddings of the Mixture of Experts module, and provide extended analysis on the importance of embeddings and collaborative signals.

Result: XRec generates personalized explanations effectively but does not outperform all baseline models consistently. Extended results show Mixture of Experts embeddings significantly influence explanation structures.

Conclusion: XRec's collaborative signals enhance its stability but not universal performance across metrics. The study contributes open-source analysis for deeper investigation by others.

Abstract: In this study, we reproduced the work done in the paper "XRec: Large Language
Models for Explainable Recommendation" by Ma et al. (2024). The original
authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning
framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with
comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to
replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM
for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided
by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by
modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's
Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates
personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating
collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all
baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the
importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation
structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language
modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation
that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the QTC dataset for multilingual question analysis and evaluates how transformer models represent morphosyntactic properties of questions across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore linguistic representation capabilities of multilingual transformer models and determine how well they capture the structural complexity and type of questions across different languages.

Method: The researchers create a labeled dataset (QTC) of questions in seven languages, use probing methods with selectivity controls to quantify representational generalizability, and compare approaches including frozen, fine-tuned, and statistical baselines.

Result: Frozen Glot500-m representations and neural probes outperform statistical baselines in capturing fine-grained structural complexities, while statistical approaches excel for explicit linguistic features in specific languages.

Conclusion: Multilingual transformers display stronger performance in representing nuanced linguistic patterns compared to statistical methods, but fine-tuning can reduce the availability of pre-trained linguistic information.

Abstract: This work investigates how a multilingual transformer model represents
morphosyntactic properties of questions. We introduce the Question Type and
Complexity (QTC) dataset with sentences across seven languages, annotated with
type information and complexity metrics including dependency length, tree
depth, and lexical density. Our evaluation extends probing methods to
regression labels with selectivity controls to quantify gains in
generalizability. We compare layer-wise probes on frozen Glot500-m (Imani et
al., 2023) representations against subword TF-IDF baselines, and a fine-tuned
model. Results show that statistical features classify questions effectively in
languages with explicit marking, while neural probes capture fine-grained
structural complexity patterns better. We use these results to evaluate when
contextual representations outperform statistical baselines and whether
parameter updates reduce the availability of pre-trained linguistic
information.

### [49] [LLM Bias Detection and Mitigation through the Lens of Desired Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06354)
*Ingroj Shrestha,Padmini Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired output distributions, whether equal or real-world, by proposing a weighted adaptive fine-tuning method to mitigate gender-profession bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research focuses on tackling bias in LLM outputs by redefining bias as deviation from application-specific desired distributions, addressing the lack of prior attention to alignment in LLMs.

Method: The authors introduce a weighted adaptive loss fine-tuning approach, evaluating gender-profession distributions derived from 2024 U.S. labor statistics across both equality-based and real-world setups.

Result: The method achieves near-complete mitigation for equality and a 30-75% reduction in bias for real-world alignment in masked LMs. Autoregressive LLMs also show 50-62% bias reduction under real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in balancing equality and factual grounding, mitigating bias significantly while maintaining the language modeling capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Although prior work on bias mitigation has focused on promoting social
equality and demographic parity, less attention has been given to aligning
LLM's outputs to desired distributions. For example, we might want to align a
model with real-world distributions to support factual grounding. Thus, we
define bias as deviation from a desired distribution, which may be an equal or
real-world distribution, depending on application goals. We propose a weighted
adaptive loss based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession
output distribution with the desired distribution, while preserving language
modeling capability. Using 3 profession sets -- male-dominated,
female-dominated, and gender-balanced -- derived from U.S. labor statistics
(2024), we assess both our adaptive method for reflecting reality and a
non-adaptive variant for equality. Across three masked language models, bias is
observed under both distributions. We achieve near-complete mitigation under
equality and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. Autoregressive LLMs
show no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with
the Llama Instruct models (3.2-3B, 3.1-8B) achieving a 50-62% reduction.

*Kshitish Ghate,Andy Liu,Devansh Jain,Taylor Sorensen,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Aylin Caliskan,Mona T. Diab,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVALUESTEER, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and reward models (RMs) to align with users' diverse value and stylistic preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the global deployment of LLMs, necessitating systems that can accommodate diverse user values and preferences, which is currently a gap due to limited controlled evaluation datasets.

Method: The authors synthetically generated 165,888 preference pairs varying systematically across value dimensions (traditional, secular-rational, survival, and self-expression) and style dimensions (verbosity, readability, confidence, and warmth) to create the EVALUESTEER benchmark. Six LLMs and RMs were evaluated under various conditions and scenarios.

Result: The results indicate that even the best models achieved less than 75% accuracy at aligning to user preferences when provided a full user profile, compared to over 99% accuracy when focusing only on relevant preferences.

Conclusion: EVALUESTEER reveals the current limitations of RMs in adapting to diverse user profiles and serves as a challenging testbed for developing models that better accommodate human values and preferences.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, creating pluralistic
systems that can accommodate the diverse preferences and values of users
worldwide becomes essential. We introduce EVALUESTEER, a benchmark to measure
LLMs' and reward models' (RMs) steerability towards users' value and stylistic
preference profiles grounded in psychology and human-LLM interaction
literature. To address the gap in existing datasets that do not support
controlled evaluations of RM steering, we synthetically generated 165,888
preference pairs -- systematically varying pairs along 4 value dimensions
(traditional, secular-rational, survival, and self-expression) and 4 style
dimensions (verbosity, readability, confidence, and warmth). We use EVALUESTEER
to evaluate whether, given a user profile and a pair of candidate value-laden
and style-laden responses, LLMs and RMs are able to select the output that
aligns with the user's preferences. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary
LLMs and RMs under sixteen systematic prompting conditions and six preference
comparison scenarios. Notably, our results show that, when given the user's
full profile of values and stylistic preferences, the best models achieve <75%
accuracy at choosing the correct response, in contrast to >99% accuracy when
only relevant style and value preferences are provided. EVALUESTEER thus
highlights the limitations of current RMs at identifying and adapting to
relevant user profile information, and provides a challenging testbed for
developing RMs that can be steered towards diverse human values and
preferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EverydayMMQA, a framework for creating culturally-grounded, multimodal datasets, and develops OASIS, a dataset with diverse questions in English and Arabic. It aims to improve performance in culturally relevant and low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing multimodal models, which perform poorly on queries requiring culturally grounded and everyday knowledge, especially in underrepresented languages.

Method: EverydayMMQA is used to create the OASIS dataset, containing ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, including text, images, and speech in various combinations. The dataset emphasizes cultural diversity and real-world scenarios.

Result: Benchmarked models (both open- and closed-source) showed varying performance on pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware reasoning tasks. The dataset provides diverse scenarios and challenges for model evaluation.

Conclusion: EverydayMMQA and OASIS offer essential resources for developing multimodal LLMs capable of culturally aware reasoning, with plans for public access to facilitate progress in this area.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models achieve strong results on tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), but they often fail when queries require culturally
grounded, everyday knowledge, particularly in low-resource and underrepresented
languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce Everyday Multimodal and
Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA), a framework for creating large-scale,
culturally-grounded datasets for spoken and visual question answering (SVQA).
Using this framework, we developed OASIS, a multimodal dataset integrating
speech, images, and text. With over ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, OASIS
contains 3.7M spoken questions, enabling four unique input combinations:
speech-only, text-only, speech+image, and text+image. Focused on English and
Arabic varieties, 18 countries, the dataset content is curated to reflect
diverse, real-world situations. OASIS tests models on tasks beyond object
recognition that involve pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware
reasoning. We benchmarked four closed-source models, three open-source models,
and one fine-tuned model. EverydayMMQA and OASIS together provide a benchmark
and training dataset for building multimodal LLMs for a comprehensive set of
everyday tasks within cultural contexts. The framework and dataset will be made
publicly available to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces semantic regexes for structured and precise feature descriptions of LLMs, improving accuracy, consistency, and scalability for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language feature descriptions for LLM interpretability are often vague, inconsistent, and require manual relabeling.

Method: The authors propose semantic regexes, utilizing language primitives and modifiers to precisely describe linguistic and semantic feature patterns in LLMs.

Result: Semantic regexes achieve accuracy comparable to natural language while being more concise, consistent, and enabling analyses of feature complexity and model-wide patterns.

Conclusion: Semantic regexes enhance human understanding of LLM activations, improving mental model accuracy and scaling interpretability across models.

Abstract: Automated interpretability aims to translate large language model (LLM)
features into human understandable descriptions. However, these natural
language feature descriptions are often vague, inconsistent, and require manual
relabeling. In response, we introduce semantic regexes, structured language
descriptions of LLM features. By combining primitives that capture linguistic
and semantic feature patterns with modifiers for contextualization,
composition, and quantification, semantic regexes produce precise and
expressive feature descriptions. Across quantitative benchmarks and qualitative
analyses, we find that semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language
while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions. Moreover,
their inherent structure affords new types of analyses, including quantifying
feature complexity across layers, scaling automated interpretability from
insights into individual features to model-wide patterns. Finally, in user
studies, we find that semantic regex descriptions help people build accurate
mental models of LLM feature activations.

### [53] [Protecting De-identified Documents from Search-based Linkage Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06383)
*Pierre Lison,Mark Anderson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of search-based linkage risks in de-identified documents and proposes a two-step method to counter such attacks using N-gram indexing and LLM-based rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: De-identification models fail to address linkage risks, where de-identified text can be traced back to its source, creating privacy concerns.

Method: The method involves constructing an inverted index to identify uncommon N-grams in the document collection, followed by using a large language model (LLM) to iteratively rewrite these spans to prevent linkage.

Result: Experimental results on court cases demonstrate the method's efficacy in preventing linkage attacks while maintaining the semantic integrity of the text.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully mitigates search-based linkage risks, addressing a key shortcoming of traditional de-identification techniques and ensuring content accuracy.

Abstract: While de-identification models can help conceal the identity of the
individual(s) mentioned in a document, they fail to address linkage risks,
defined as the potential to map the de-identified text back to its source. One
straightforward way to perform such linkages is to extract phrases from the
de-identified document and then check their presence in the original dataset.
This paper presents a method to counter search-based linkage attacks while
preserving the semantic integrity of the text. The method proceeds in two
steps. We first construct an inverted index of the N-grams occurring in the
document collection, making it possible to efficiently determine which N-grams
appear in less than $k$ documents (either alone or in combination with other
N-grams). An LLM-based rewriter is then iteratively queried to reformulate
those spans until linkage is no longer possible. Experimental results on a
collection of court cases show that the method is able to effectively prevent
search-based linkages while remaining faithful to the original content.

*Fan Zhou,Chang Tian,Tim Van de Cruys*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RegDiff is a framework for generating stylistic text using diffusion models without requiring a pretrained classifier, addressing issues like high computational costs and poor attribute control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve controllable text generation using diffusion models while addressing semantic preservation, attribute alignment, and computational efficiency.

Method: Utilizing a VAE-based encoder-decoder architecture coupled with latent diffusion trained with attribute supervision, injecting attribute information only during training.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that RegDiff generates stylistic text better than existing baselines, achieving controllable text generation efficiently.

Conclusion: RegDiff is an effective and computationally efficient method for generating stylistic texts with improved attribute control compared to prevalent techniques.

Abstract: Generating stylistic text with specific attributes is a key problem in
controllable text generation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches
can be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier
guidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it
often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies
the denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute
alignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering
from classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a
regularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without
requiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving
controllable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff
employs a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction
fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to
enable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only
during training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic
attributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating
stylistic texts. These results validate the effectiveness of RegDiff as an
efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion. Our code,
datasets, and resources will be released upon publication at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces VeriCode and Vibe Checker to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for both functional correctness and their ability to follow code instructions, emphasizing human preferences in programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM code evaluation focuses on functionality but lacks assessment of non-functional, human-preference-oriented aspects, like vibe checks.

Method: The authors developed VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions paired with deterministic verifiers, and integrated it into a testbed called Vibe Checker.

Result: Evaluation of 31 LLMs showed struggles in instruction following and some regression in functional correctness. Combining instruction following and functional correctness correlates best with human preference.

Conclusion: Instruction following is a key contributor to user satisfaction, paving the way for models to better align with human preferences in coding tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage
LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language
interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world
human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,
read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code
evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,
overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this
paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece
underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides
functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following
capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30
verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic
verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,
resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following
and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even
the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit
clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional
correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human
preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on
real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe
check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that
better align with user preferences in coding.

### [56] [Reward Model Perspectives: Whose Opinions Do Reward Models Reward?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06391)
*Elle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper shows reward models (RMs) in language models (LMs) are misaligned with demographic diversity and reinforce biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of reward models, which guide language model alignment, especially regarding biases and demographic relevance.

Method: A framework was formalized to measure RM alignment and biases, using controversial topics to evaluate their opinions, attitudes, and values. Prompting was explored as a steering mechanism.

Result: Reward models were found to poorly align with various demographic groups and systematically reinforced harmful stereotypes. Simply steering prompts was ineffective in addressing these issues.

Conclusion: Careful evaluation of reward model behavior is essential during preference learning to mitigate biases and their impact on language technology.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to the alignment of language models (LMs). An
RM often serves as a proxy for human preferences to guide downstream LM
behavior. However, our understanding of RM behavior is limited. Our work (i)
formalizes a framework for measuring the alignment of opinions captured by RMs,
(ii) investigates the extent to which RMs demonstrate sociodemographic biases,
and (iii) explores the effects of prompting to steer rewards towards the
preferences of a target group. We study the subjective and diverse perspectives
on controversial topics, which allows us to quantify RM perspectives in terms
of their opinions, attitudes, and values. We show that RMs are poorly aligned
with several demographic groups and can systematically reward harmful
stereotypes, and steering alone is not enough to overcome these limitations.
Our findings underscore the need for more careful consideration of RM behavior
in model alignment during preference learning to prevent the propagation of
unwanted social biases in the language technologies that we use.

*R. Alexander Knipper,Indrani Dey,Souvika Sarkar,Hari Narayanan,Sadhana Puntambekar,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an alignment framework for enabling teachers to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create simulation-aligned, instructional questions for virtual labs, enhancing teacher efficiency and question quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers face challenges in adapting virtual lab resources to meet their instructional needs due to misalignment with third-party materials and difficulty in creating scalable custom content.

Method: A four-component alignment framework is proposed, consisting of teacher-LLM dialogues for understanding goals, lab content analysis, a question taxonomy for structuring pedagogy and cognition, and TELeR taxonomy for fine-tuning prompts. Evaluation involved a case study and analysis of questions generated by 19 LLMs.

Result: The study shows improved question quality and adherence, with larger LLMs performing better in terms of parsability (+37.1%), adherence (+25.7%), and Likert scale quality (+0.8 points). Open-ended and relational questions also scored higher in quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully leverages LLMs to create pedagogically meaningful and simulation-aligned questions, addressing the scalability and alignment challenges in virtual science labs.

Abstract: Virtual Labs offer valuable opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based science
learning, yet teachers often struggle to adapt them to fit their instructional
goals. Third-party materials may not align with classroom needs, and developing
custom resources can be time-consuming and difficult to scale. Recent advances
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing these
limitations. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment framework for
instructional goal-aligned question generation, enabling teachers to leverage
LLMs to produce simulation-aligned, pedagogically meaningful questions through
natural language interaction. The framework integrates four components:
instructional goal understanding via teacher-LLM dialogue, lab understanding
via knowledge unit and relationship analysis, a question taxonomy for
structuring cognitive and pedagogical intent, and the TELeR taxonomy for
controlling prompt detail. Early design choices were informed by a small
teacher-assisted case study, while our final evaluation analyzed over 1,100
questions from 19 open-source LLMs. With goal and lab understanding grounding
questions in teacher intent and simulation context, the question taxonomy
elevates cognitive demand (open-ended formats and relational types raise
quality by 0.29-0.39 points), and optimized TELeR prompts enhance format
adherence (80% parsability, >90% adherence). Larger models yield the strongest
gains: parsability +37.1%, adherence +25.7%, and average quality +0.8 Likert
points.

*Yitao Long,Tiansheng Hu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FinLFQA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs in generating accurate, reliably-attributed long-form financial answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of hallucination in LLM-generated answers to complex financial questions by proposing a benchmark that evaluates attribution more comprehensively than simple reference retrieval.

Method: The authors develop FinLFQA, a benchmark evaluating long-form financial question answers using human annotations for supporting evidence, numerical reasoning steps, and financial domain knowledge. They also provide automatic evaluation metrics and conduct experiments with eight LLMs.

Result: The study finds that detailed metrics are crucial to assess LLM capabilities, end-to-end generation performs comparably to post-hoc approaches, and iterative refinement aids only with external feedback.

Conclusion: Reliable attribution in LLMs goes beyond reference retrieval, requiring nuanced evaluations such as those proposed in FinLFQA for accuracy and reasoning in specialized domains like finance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate to long-form questions,
producing plausible yet factually incorrect answers. A common mitigation
strategy is to provide attribution to LLM outputs. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on simple attribution that retrieves supporting textual
evidence as references. We argue that in real-world scenarios such as financial
applications, attribution goes beyond reference retrieval. We introduce
FinLFQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate
long-form answers to complex financial questions with reliable and nuanced
attributions. FinLFQA evaluates three critical aspects of attribution through
human annotations: (1) supporting evidence extracted from financial reports,
(2) intermediate numerical reasoning steps, and (3) domain-specific financial
knowledge that informs the reasoning process. We further provide an automatic
evaluation framework covering both answer quality and attribution quality.
Through extensive experiments on eight LLMs across multiple
attribution-generation paradigms, we find that fine-grained metrics are
important to distinguish model capabilities, that end-to-end generation
achieves comparable performance to post-hoc approaches, and that iterative
refinement only helps when guided by external feedback.

*Elena Chistova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniRST is a unified RST-style discourse parser capable of handling multiple languages and treebanks using innovative training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of handling multiple languages and diverse relation inventories in RST-style discourse parsing.

Method: Two training strategies, Multi-Head and Masked-Union, were proposed and evaluated, alongside a low-resource data augmentation technique.

Result: The Masked-Union approach proved strongest, and UniRST outperformed 16 of 18 mono-treebank baselines.

Conclusion: UniRST validates the feasibility of multilingual, unified end-to-end discourse parsing for diverse languages and data sets.

Abstract: We introduce UniRST, the first unified RST-style discourse parser capable of
handling 18 treebanks in 11 languages without modifying their relation
inventories. To overcome inventory incompatibilities, we propose and evaluate
two training strategies: Multi-Head, which assigns separate relation
classification layer per inventory, and Masked-Union, which enables shared
parameter training through selective label masking. We first benchmark
monotreebank parsing with a simple yet effective augmentation technique for
low-resource settings. We then train a unified model and show that (1) the
parameter efficient Masked-Union approach is also the strongest, and (2) UniRST
outperforms 16 of 18 mono-treebank baselines, demonstrating the advantages of a
single-model, multilingual end-to-end discourse parsing across diverse
resources.

### [60] [MathRobust-LV: Evaluation of Large Language Models' Robustness to Linguistic Variations in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06430)
*Neeraja Kirtane,Yuvraj Khanna,Peter Relan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces MathRobust-LV, an evaluation methodology to test large language models' robustness in solving rephrased high-school-level math problems. It reveals that model accuracy declines under linguistic variations, with smaller models being more affected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research in math benchmarks for large language models focuses on high-difficulty tasks, neglecting the practical need for models that can handle rephrased, high-school-level math problems in educational settings like tutoring and assessments.

Method: The paper develops MathRobust-LV, a test set that rephrases math problems at a high-school difficulty level by changing surface details while maintaining numerical structure. It evaluates 34 language models against these rephrased problems.

Result: Accuracy drops for all models when dealing with rephrased problems. Smaller models show a 9-11% decline, while larger models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5pro remain relatively stable.

Conclusion: Linguistic robustness is essential for reliable use of language models in educational contexts. The observed performance degradation underscores a fundamental challenge in improving these models' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models excel on math benchmarks, but their math reasoning
robustness to linguistic variation is underexplored. While recent work
increasingly treats high-difficulty competitions like the IMO as the gold
standard for evaluating reasoning, we believe in comprehensive benchmarking of
high school-level math problems in real educational settings. We introduce
MathRobust-LV, a test set and evaluation methodology that mirrors how
instructors rephrase problems across assessments while keeping difficulty
constant: we change surface details (names, contexts, variables) while
preserving numerical structure and answers. In contrast to prior efforts that
alter problem content or emphasize IMO-level tasks, we focus on
high-school-level dataset problems at the difficulty level where models are
currently deployed in educational settings: tutoring and assessment systems. In
these applications, instructors rephrase identical concepts in varied ways,
making linguistic robustness essential for reliable deployment. Although MATH
data benchmarking is often regarded as saturated, our experiment on 34 models
reveals that accuracy declines when moving from the baseline to the variants.
These drops are severe for smaller models (9-11%) while stronger models also
show measurable degradation. Frontier models like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5pro remain
comparatively stable. Our results highlight that robustness to linguistic
variation is a fundamental challenge, exposing reasoning vulnerabilities in
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive survey on security in autonomous large language model agents, detailing their applications, vulnerabilities, and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the new class of security risks introduced by autonomous large language model agents in cybersecurity.

Method: The authors structured the field into Applications, Threats, and Defenses, creating a taxonomy based on over 150 papers, and performed a detailed analysis on agent architectures and coverage.

Result: They highlighted emerging trends in agent architectures and identified significant research gaps in model and modality coverage.

Conclusion: The study lays the groundwork for understanding the security landscape of autonomous LLM agents and emphasizes the need for future research to address gaps in defenses and modality coverage.

Abstract: The rapid shift from passive LLMs to autonomous LLM-agents marks a new
paradigm in cybersecurity. While these agents can act as powerful tools for
both offensive and defensive operations, the very agentic context introduces a
new class of inherent security risks. In this work we present the first
holistic survey of the agentic security landscape, structuring the field around
three interdependent pillars: Applications, Threats, and Defenses. We provide a
comprehensive taxonomy of over 150 papers, explaining how agents are used, the
vulnerabilities they possess, and the countermeasures designed to protect them.
A detailed cross-cutting analysis shows emerging trends in agent architecture
while revealing critical research gaps in model and modality coverage.

### [62] [Linguistically Informed Tokenization Improves ASR for Underresourced Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06461)
*Massimo Daul,Alessio Tosolini,Claire Bowern*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for documenting underresourced languages, showing that fine-tuning on phonemic tokenization improves performance and speeds up transcription.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of using modern ASR systems for underresourced languages due to their high data requirements, focusing on the Indigenous Australian language Yan-nhangu.

Method: Fine-tuned a wav2vec2 ASR model using phonemic and orthographic tokenization strategies, and evaluated performance in a language documentation pipeline.

Result: Phonemic tokenization significantly improved Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) over orthographic tokenization. Additionally, correcting ASR output was faster than manual transcription.

Conclusion: ASR systems can be effectively adapted for underresourced languages through linguistic-informed tokenization strategies, supporting faster transcription workflows in language documentation efforts.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a crucial tool for linguists aiming to
perform a variety of language documentation tasks. However, modern ASR systems
use data-hungry transformer architectures, rendering them generally unusable
for underresourced languages. We fine-tune a wav2vec2 ASR model on Yan-nhangu,
a dormant Indigenous Australian language, comparing the effects of phonemic and
orthographic tokenization strategies on performance. In parallel, we explore
ASR's viability as a tool in a language documentation pipeline. We find that a
linguistically informed phonemic tokenization system substantially improves WER
and CER compared to a baseline orthographic tokenization scheme. Finally, we
show that hand-correcting the output of an ASR model is much faster than
hand-transcribing audio from scratch, demonstrating that ASR can work for
underresourced languages.

### [63] [Test-Time Scaling of Reasoning Models for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06471)
*Zihao Li,Shaoxiong Ji,Jörg Tiedemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (TTS) yields inconsistent benefits in machine translation (MT) for general-purpose reasoning models, but demonstrates promise in domain-specific fine-tuning and post-editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether test-time scaling (TTS), which enhances performance in reasoning models for other tasks, can improve translation quality in MT and identify effective use cases.

Method: The paper evaluates 12 reasoning models across diverse machine translation benchmarks and examines TTS in three scenarios: direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation, and post-editing.

Result: For general-purpose models, TTS provides limited benefits for direct translation, with performance quickly plateauing. Domain-specific fine-tuning enhances TTS effectiveness, yielding consistent improvements. Forced reasoning beyond natural limits degrades quality, while TTS is highly effective for post-editing tasks.

Conclusion: Inference-time computation in MT does not enhance single-pass translation with general models but shows promise in targeted multi-step processes like post-editing and with task-specialized models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has enhanced the performance of Reasoning Models
(RMs) on various tasks such as math and coding, yet its efficacy in machine
translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether
increased inference-time computation improves translation quality. We evaluate
12 RMs across a diverse suite of MT benchmarks spanning multiple domains,
examining three scenarios: direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation,
and post-editing. Our findings show that for general-purpose RMs, TTS provides
limited and inconsistent benefits for direct translation, with performance
quickly plateauing. However, the effectiveness of TTS is unlocked by
domain-specific fine-tuning, which aligns a model's reasoning process with task
requirements, leading to consistent improvements up to an optimal,
self-determined reasoning depth. We also find that forcing a model to reason
beyond its natural stopping point consistently degrades translation quality. In
contrast, TTS proves highly effective in a post-editing context, reliably
turning self-correction into a beneficial process. These results indicate that
the value of inference-time computation in MT lies not in enhancing single-pass
translation with general models, but in targeted applications like multi-step,
self-correction workflows and in conjunction with task-specialized models.

### [64] [Webscale-RL: Automated Data Pipeline for Scaling RL Data to Pretraining Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06499)
*Zhepeng Cen,Haolin Chen,Shiyu Wang,Zuxin Liu,Zhiwei Liu,Ding Zhao,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Huan Wang,Weiran Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline to convert large-scale pre-training documents into question-answer pairs to improve reinforcement learning efficiency in training language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in robust reasoning and the training-generation gap of language models trained with imitation learning, and to address the data bottleneck in reinforcement learning training.

Method: The authors developed Webscale-RL pipeline, which systematically produces diverse question-answer pairs from large-scale pre-training documents. They created Webscale-RL dataset with 1.2 million examples spanning over 9 domains.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that models trained on the Webscale-RL dataset outperformed both continual pre-training and data refinement baselines. RL training with this data achieved comparable performance to continual pre-training using significantly fewer tokens.

Conclusion: The study showcases a scalable approach to make RL training data more extensive and diverse, paving the way for efficient language model training equivalent to pre-training scales.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through
imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a
training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet
its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL
datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale
pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a
scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training
documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL.
Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2
million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the
model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining
and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL
training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the
performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our
work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling
more capable and efficient language models.

### [65] [From Acceleration to Saturation: Scaling Behavior of Bootstrapped Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06548)
*Seng Pei Liew,Takuya Kato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the efficiency of reusing overtrained language models for further pretraining and identifies diminishing returns in performance improvements through a predictable scaling law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether bootstrapped pretraining, which reuses previously pretrained language models, can effectively reduce the computational costs in training new or enhanced models.

Method: The researchers conducted empirical analyses by evaluating and modeling the scaling behavior of bootstrapped two-stage pretraining across varying amounts of tokens used in the first and second stages.

Result: They identified a logarithmic decrease in scaling efficiency based on the amount of pretraining tokens, producing a predictable scaling law to describe this interaction.

Conclusion: Extensive pretraining of base models limits the benefits of further bootstrapped pretraining, presenting a fundamental trade-off and providing practical insights for optimizing multi-stage pretraining approaches.

Abstract: Bootstrapped pretraining, i.e., the reuse of a pretrained base model for
further pretraining, such as continual pretraining or model growth, is
promising at reducing the cost of training language models from scratch.
However, its effectiveness remains unclear, especially when applied to
overtrained base models. In this work, we empirically study the scaling
behavior of bootstrapped pretraining and find that its scaling efficiency
diminishes in a predictable manner: The scaling exponent with respect to
second-stage pretraining tokens decreases logarithmically with the number of
tokens used to pretrain the base model. The joint dependence on first- and
second-stage tokens is accurately modeled by a simple scaling law. Such
saturation effect reveals a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage pretraining
strategies: the more extensively a model is pretrained, the less additional
benefit bootstrapping provides. Our findings provide practical insights for
efficient language model training and raise important considerations for the
reuse of overtrained models.

### [66] [Flipping the Dialogue: Training and Evaluating User Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06552)
*Tarek Naous,Philippe Laban,Wei Xu,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes dedicated User LMs to simulate human users in multi-turn conversations, highlighting their better alignment with human behavior compared to assistants trained as users. Assistant LMs struggle in realistic settings, confirmed by performance drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods use assistant LMs to simulate users in conversations, but these fail to accurately reflect real human behavior due to their optimized role as helpful assistants.

Method: The approach involves post-training models as User LMs, designed specifically to emulate human-like user behavior in conversation settings.

Result: User LMs show improved alignment with human behavior compared to assistant LMs and demonstrate better robustness in simulations. Performance of strong assistant models drops in realistic User LM simulations.

Conclusion: Using User LMs reveals challenges faced by assistant LMs in more realistic, nuanced user interactions, emphasizing the need for purpose-built user simulation models to evaluate conversational AI effectively.

Abstract: Conversations with LMs involve two participants: a human user leading the
conversation, and an LM assistant responding to the user's request. To satisfy
this specific role, LMs are post-trained to be helpful assistants -- optimized
to produce exhaustive and well-structured responses, free of ambiguity and
grammar errors. User utterances, on the other hand, are rarely perfected, with
each user phrasing requests in unique ways, sometimes putting in partial effort
at each turn and refining on the fly. To evaluate LM performance in realistic
settings, prior work simulated users in multi-turn conversations, often
prompting an LLM originally trained to be a helpful assistant to act as a user.
However, we show that assistant LMs make for poor user simulators, with the
surprising finding that better assistants yield worse simulators. Instead, we
introduce purpose-built User Language Models (User LMs) - models post-trained
to simulate human users in multi-turn conversations. Through various
evaluations, we show how User LMs align better with human behavior and achieve
better simulation robustness than existing simulation methods. When leveraging
User LMs to simulate coding and math conversations, the performance of a strong
assistant (GPT-4o) drops from 74.6% to 57.4%, confirming that more realistic
simulation environments lead to assistant struggles as they fail to cope with
the nuances of users in multi-turn setups.

### [67] [The Algebra of Meaning: Why Machines Need Montague More Than Moore's Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06559)
*Cheonkam Jeong,Sungdo Kim,Jewoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Savassan,' a neuro-symbolic system that incorporates type-theoretic semantics to align language model outputs, focusing on legal and normative reasoning across jurisdictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle with meaning consistency, leading to issues like hallucination and unreliable compliance outcomes. The paper aims to address these by leveraging type-theoretic semantics to align natural language processing with legal and normative reasoning.

Method: Savassan combines neural and symbolic components to parse language inputs into Montague-style logical forms with typed ontologies. Neural modules propose candidate structures, and symbolic modules handle type-checking, constraint reasoning, and jurisdictional compliance mapping.

Result: The system effectively processes natural-language inputs into structured outputs that support explainable, compliance-aware decision-making across different jurisdictions. Outcomes are compositional, ensuring accuracy and transparency in a multi-legal-context framework.

Conclusion: Trustworthy natural language models require compositional typing to enable reasoning about descriptive, normative, and legal semantics. This unified algebraic approach contributes to more reliable, explainable AI systems for legal contexts.

Abstract: Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of
meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation,
and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics
rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language
as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem:
natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit
their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances
into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended
with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract
candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type
checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce
compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border
scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y))
and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk
in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into
a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error;
(ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii)
a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline.
We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic
multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires
compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is
described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified
algebra of meaning.

Motivation: To tackle the increasing complexity and challenges in extending and maintaining multi-agent workflows and tools used in automatic research with LLMs.

Method: TinyScientist framework is designed to identify essential components of research workflows, and it provides an interactive, extensible, and controllable structure adaptable to new tools.

Result: The authors developed an open-source codebase, an interactive web demo, and a PyPI Python package to make automated research workflows more accessible to researchers and developers.

Conclusion: TinyScientist offers a scalable solution to simplify and extend automatic research processes, enabling iterative growth and reducing barriers for users.

Abstract: Automatic research with Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly gaining
importance, driving the development of increasingly complex workflows involving
multi-agent systems, planning, tool usage, code execution, and human-agent
interaction to accelerate research processes. However, as more researchers and
developers begin to use and build upon these tools and platforms, the
complexity and difficulty of extending and maintaining such agentic workflows
have become a significant challenge, particularly as algorithms and
architectures continue to advance. To address this growing complexity,
TinyScientist identifies the essential components of the automatic research
workflow and proposes an interactive, extensible, and controllable framework
that easily adapts to new tools and supports iterative growth. We provide an
open-source codebase, an interactive web demonstration, and a PyPI Python
package to make state-of-the-art auto-research pipelines broadly accessible to

### [69] [Do Internal Layers of LLMs Reveal Patterns for Jailbreak Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06594)
*Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the internal behavior of large language models (LLMs) under jailbreak prompts versus benign prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the increasing prevalence of jailbreaking attacks on conversational LLMs, which bypass restrictions by exploiting vulnerabilities through prompts.

Method: The study investigates internal representations of LLMs, focusing on the hidden layer responses of models like GPT-J and Mamba2 to jailbreak and benign prompts.

Result: Preliminary findings show that distinct layer-wise behaviors exist between jailbreak and benign prompts in LLMs.

Conclusion: Internal model dynamics may serve as a foundation for developing advanced jailbreak detection and defense mechanisms in conversational LLMs.

Abstract: Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a pressing concern
with the increasing prevalence and accessibility of conversational LLMs.
Adversarial users often exploit these models through carefully engineered
prompts to elicit restricted or sensitive outputs, a strategy widely referred
to as jailbreaking. While numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed,
attackers continuously develop novel prompting techniques, and no existing
model can be considered fully resistant. In this study, we investigate the
jailbreak phenomenon by examining the internal representations of LLMs, with a
focus on how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts.
Specifically, we analyze the open-source LLM GPT-J and the state-space model
Mamba2, presenting preliminary findings that highlight distinct layer-wise
behaviors. Our results suggest promising directions for further research on
leveraging internal model dynamics for robust jailbreak detection and defense.

*Nhat M. Hoang,Do Xuan Long,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Min-Yen Kan,Luu Anh Tuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how contextual information flows in State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformer-Based Models (TBMs), highlighting differences in token representation evolution and suggesting implications for model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how token representations evolve within SSMs and TBMs, addressing a gap in analyzing their contextual information propagation at the token and layer levels.

Method: The study employs centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, probing techniques, theoretical analysis, and parameter randomization to investigate representation dynamics within layers of SSMs and TBMs.

Result: The analysis reveals that TBMs homogenize token representations early on, regaining diversity later, while SSMs maintain token uniqueness early but converge to homogenization deeper. The causes are linked to architectural design in TBMs and training dynamics in SSMs.

Conclusion: Findings clarify the inductive biases of SSMs and TBMs, offering insights for designing models and training strategies to enhance long-context reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformer-Based Models (TBMs) for long-sequence processing, offering linear
scaling and lower memory use. Yet, how contextual information flows across
layers and tokens in these architectures remains understudied. We present the
first unified, token- and layer-level analysis of representation propagation in
SSMs and TBMs. Using centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, and probing,
we characterize how representations evolve within and across layers. We find a
key divergence: TBMs rapidly homogenize token representations, with diversity
reemerging only in later layers, while SSMs preserve token uniqueness early but
converge to homogenization deeper. Theoretical analysis and parameter
randomization further reveal that oversmoothing in TBMs stems from
architectural design, whereas in SSMs it arises mainly from training dynamics.
These insights clarify the inductive biases of both architectures and inform
future model and training designs for long-context reasoning.

*Shangjian Yin,Zhepei Wei,Xinyu Zhu,Wei-Lin Chen,Yu Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-synthetic framework called Self-Alignment Optimization (SAO) that allows large language models (LLMs) to enhance their alignment without relying on expensive human or external AI feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the high costs and dependency on external resources typically associated with reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback for aligning large language models.

Method: The authors introduce SAO, a method where the LLM generates its own prompts, responses, and preferences through persona role-play, and self-evaluates these data for alignment optimization.

Result: Experiments show that SAO improves LLM chat capabilities in benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 and maintains strong performance on specific tasks like question-answering and mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: SAO is presented as an effective, cost-efficient solution for self-improvement in LLM alignment, demonstrating its practicality and performance advantages.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large
language models (LLMs) relies on expensive human-annotated datasets, while
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) also incurs significant costs,
requiring the collection of diverse prompts and corresponding responses, often
necessitating external reward models or proprietary models like GPT-4 to
annotate preference pairs. In this work, we introduce Self-Alignment
Optimization (SAO), a fully self-synthetic framework for LLM alignment, where
all training data, including prompts (i.e., user queries), responses, and
preferences, are generated by the model itself. Specifically, SAO first
instructs the LLM to engage in persona role-play and generate diverse prompts
and responses, which are then self-evaluated for preference optimization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAO effectively enhances the model's
chat capabilities on standard benchmarks like AlpacaEval~2.0, while maintaining
strong performance on downstream objective tasks (e.g., question-answering,
math reasoning). Our work provides a practical solution for self-improvement in
aligning LLMs, and the code for reproducing our results is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WeatherArchive-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate systems that use historical archives for understanding societal responses to extreme weather events. It aims to assist climate research by addressing challenges in processing archival data using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical archives contain valuable qualitative accounts of societal responses to extreme weather, but their scale and complexity make them hard to use for structured climate research data. There is no benchmark to evaluate systems processing this data.

Method: The paper introduces WeatherArchive-Bench with two main tasks: retrieval of relevant weather-related segments (WeatherArchive-Retrieval) and classification of societal vulnerability and resilience indicators (WeatherArchive-Assessment). They conduct experiments using sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers alongside diverse Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: Dense retrievers showed limitations in coping with historical terminology, and LLMs misinterpreted indicators of vulnerability and resilience. These experiments identify weaknesses in current tools for understanding complex archival contexts.

Conclusion: WeatherArchive-Bench provides a valuable resource for improving RAG systems in climate research. It highlights the need for better handling of historical language and societal indicators and promotes advancements in retrieving and assessing archival weather data.

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolMem, a system for agents to record and utilize memories of tool capabilities in order to improve task accuracy and tool selection effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the limitation of existing agents that rely on fixed tools, which restricts adaptability in selecting the best-suited tool for specific tasks.

Method: ToolMem summarizes tool strengths and weaknesses from past interactions and stores them in memory; during inference, relevant entries are retrieved to select the optimal tool for task execution.

Result: ToolMem improves tool performance prediction accuracy by 14.8% in text generation and 28.7% in text-to-image generation. It enhances optimal tool selection by 21% and 24% absolute increases across respective scenarios.

Conclusion: ToolMem enables agents to mimic human-like adaptability and decision-making by leveraging memories of tool capabilities, resulting in improved task performance and adaptability in selecting tools.

Abstract: Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse
tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as
calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly
across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied
scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the
flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In
contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different
tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal
tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from
this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of
tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths
and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve
relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual
tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation
and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic
agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and
28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios.
Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by
21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

*Shangjian Yin,Shining Liang,Wenbiao Ding,Yuli Qian,Zhouxing Shi,Hongzhi Li,Yutao Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PiKa, an efficient alignment dataset requiring significantly less data to fine-tune language models compared to existing methods while maintaining or surpassing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scalability, reproducibility, and dependency on proprietary or costly datasets for aligning LLMs effectively.

Method: The PiKa-SFT dataset utilizes only 30k supervised fine-tuning examples and is evaluated by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base and Qwen2.5 series models.

Result: Models fine-tuned on PiKa-SFT outperform larger-scale datasets and proprietary baselines in benchmarks, demonstrating efficiency and superiority despite using less data.

Conclusion: High-quality LLM alignment can be achieved using significantly fewer training examples, making alignment methods more accessible and scalable for broader research communities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone
for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness depends
on high-quality instruction data. Most existing alignment datasets are either
private or require costly human annotation, which limits reproducibility and
scalability. Even with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF),
concerns about data quality remain. Moreover, it is unclear how much data is
actually required to fine-tune a base model into a strong instruction-following
model. Current approaches often rely on over 300k examples even at the
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, yet they still underperform compared to
proprietary models, creating barriers for academic and resource-limited
communities. To address this gap, we introduce PiKa, a data-efficient family of
expert-level alignment datasets. In particular, the PiKa-SFT dataset uses only
30k SFT examples, far fewer than state-of-the-art datasets like Magpie. Through
evaluations by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa and other public datasets,
we show that PiKa-SFT outperforms models trained on much larger data. On
AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, PiKa-SFT fine-tuning even surpasses
the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million proprietary
examples. We further extend our study by training the Qwen2.5 series (0.5B to
7B) on PiKa-SFT, achieving consistent gains. These findings demonstrate that
high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a
scalable path for open-source LLM alignment. Code and data:

*Yisha Wu,Cen,Zhao,Yuanpei Cao,Xiaoqing Su,Yashar Mehdad,Mindy Ji,Claire Na Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an incremental summarization system for customer support agents that enables concise note generation during conversations, reducing workload and enhancing productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer support agents face challenges like context-switching and redundant reviews when handling extensive conversations. This paper aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: The system employs a Mixtral-8x7B model for generating bullet notes continuously during conversations and a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter irrelevant data. It integrates an agent feedback loop to refine summaries dynamically and improve model performance through retraining.

Result: The system achieved a 3% reduction in average handling time for customer cases and up to a 9% reduction in complex cases. It also garnered high agent satisfaction ratings.

Conclusion: Incremental summarization, coupled with real-time feedback, is an effective way to enhance summary precision, reduce case handling time, and improve agent satisfaction.

Abstract: We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents
that intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during
conversations, reducing agents' context-switching effort and redundant review.
Our approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note
generation with a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter trivial content. Agent
edits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model
retraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our
system achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk
summarization (with reductions of up to 9% in highly complex cases), alongside
high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that
incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary
quality and agent productivity at scale.

### [76] [Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Bootstrapping LLMs on Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06695)
*Qinhao Zhou,Xiang Xiang,Kun He,John E. Hopcroft*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel small-parameter, back-translation strategy for optimizing prompts in machine translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt engineering methods focus on optimizing the instruction component and rely on large-parameter LLMs, which are less effective for tasks like machine translation where the input component is more critical.

Method: A back-translation-based strategy is employed, utilizing a small-parameter model for optimizing the input component in prompts specific to machine translation tasks.

Result: The method significantly reduces training overhead while achieving effective performance for single-task optimization.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient for machine translation tasks and can potentially be adapted for other downstream tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to
model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:
the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the
\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language
generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input}
component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component
tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on
optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often
requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches
exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the
\textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation,
this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed
for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter
model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing
training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly
effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be
extended to other downstream tasks.

### [77] [How Language Models Conflate Logical Validity with Plausibility: A Representational Analysis of Content Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06700)
*Leonardo Bertolazzi,Sandro Pezzelle,Raffaelle Bernardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work examines why large language models (LLMs) confuse plausibility and validity, demonstrating they are linearly aligned in LLM representations. It proposes methods to disentangle these concepts, improving logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit content effects, where the semantic plausibility of a problem interferes with reasoning about its logical validity.

Method: The study analyzes the representational geometry of LLMs to determine how plausibility and validity are encoded. It uses steering vectors to manipulate these representations and proposes debiasing vectors to disentangle the concepts.

Result: Findings reveal that plausibility and validity are geometrically aligned in LLMs' internal representations, causing content biases. Debiasing vectors successfully reduce these biases and improve reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of abstract concept representation in LLMs and demonstrates that representational adjustments can make these models less biased and more logically accurate.

Abstract: Both humans and large language models (LLMs) exhibit content effects: biases
in which the plausibility of the semantic content of a reasoning problem
influences judgments regarding its logical validity. While this phenomenon in
humans is best explained by the dual-process theory of reasoning, the
mechanisms behind content effects in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we
address this issue by investigating how LLMs encode the concepts of validity
and plausibility within their internal representations. We show that both
concepts are linearly represented and strongly aligned in representational
geometry, leading models to conflate plausibility with validity. Using steering
vectors, we demonstrate that plausibility vectors can causally bias validity
judgements, and vice versa, and that the degree of alignment between these two
concepts predicts the magnitude of behavioral content effects across models.
Finally, we construct debiasing vectors that disentangle these concepts,
reducing content effects and improving reasoning accuracy. Our findings advance
understanding of how abstract logical concepts are represented in LLMs and
highlight representational interventions as a path toward more logical systems.

*Miao Lu,Weiwei Sun,Weihua Du,Zhan Ling,Xuesong Yao,Kang Liu,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, SUPO, for improving reinforcement learning in large language models, focusing on long-horizon tasks that exceed standard context limits through summarization-based context management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in RL fine-tuning for LLMs, such as degraded instruction following, high rollout costs, and strict context limits impacting long-horizon tool use.

Method: The method involves summarization-based context management, where an LLM compresses tool usage history into summaries retaining task-relevant information. A policy gradient representation is derived to optimize both tool-use behaviors and summarization strategies in an end-to-end manner.

Result: The SUPO algorithm improves success rates in interactive tasks while keeping or reducing context length. It also performs better in complex tasks when scaling test-time summarization rounds beyond training settings.

Conclusion: Summarization-based context management is established as an effective way to enable RL agents to operate beyond context length limitations, facilitating scalable and efficient long-horizon training.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model
(LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly
becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from
degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly,
strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce
summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it
periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that
retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the
agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation,
we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM
RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization
strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with
\underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization
(\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond
a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and
searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the
success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length
compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks,
\texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling
test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our
results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and
scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

*Manuel Frank,Haithem Afli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic benchmark, PTEB, for evaluating sentence embedding models using stochastic paraphrasing during evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks like MTEB can inflate performance due to repeated tuning and fail to assess real-world robustness.

Method: The authors propose a stochastic evaluation using LLMs to create semantically-preserving paraphrases, validated over multiple tasks and multilingual datasets.

Result: They demonstrate that sentence encoder performance is sensitive to token changes despite fixed semantics. Smaller models respond similarly to larger ones, and findings extend across languages.

Conclusion: Dynamic benchmarks like PTEB provide a robust alternative to static evaluations, offering insights into real-world model reliability.

Abstract: Current evaluations of sentence embedding models typically rely on static
test beds such as the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While
invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported performance
and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding
Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates
meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across
multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in semantic
textual similarity gold ratings, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but
semantically preserving, paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our
hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in
token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller
models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results
are statistically robust over multiple runs and we extended our experiments to
3 multilingual datasets covering 10 languages. More generally, we aim to
propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static,
pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation
leveraging eval-time compute.

### [80] [Are LLMs Reliable Rankers? Rank Manipulation via Two-Stage Token Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06732)
*Tiancheng Xing,Jerry Li,Yixuan Du,Xiyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAF, a two-stage token optimization method that manipulates LLM-based rankers to promote target items with natural-sounding prompts, exposing vulnerabilities in LLM-driven information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to expose the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) as rerankers in information retrieval systems, specifically how their rankings can be steered through simple textual prompts.

Method: RAF is a two-stage token optimization method. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient combined with readability scores to shortlist candidate tokens. Stage 2 applies an entropy-based weighting for ranking and readability losses, selecting final tokens using temperature-controlled sampling.

Result: RAF demonstrates significant effectiveness in promoting target items across multiple LLMs while preserving linguistic naturalness. The method is more robust than existing techniques for adversarial manipulation.

Conclusion: LLM-based reranking is prone to adversarial manipulation, raising concerns around the robustness and trustworthiness of such systems in modern retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in
information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small,
natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank
Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise
textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated
rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate
Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the
gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those
candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based
dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled
sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by
dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic
naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly
boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater
robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining
naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication:
LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation,
raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern
retrieval systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.

*Boyi Zeng,Lin Chen,Ziwei He,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to fingerprint large language models (LLMs) using weight matrices, enabling reliable model lineage verification even after post-training processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of protecting the intellectual property of LLMs requires effective methods to identify whether a model is derived from an existing base or trained independently, particularly given the challenges posed by post-training modifications.

Method: The authors propose a training-free method leveraging the Linear Assignment Problem and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity metrics to compare weight matrices of models. This method is designed to be robust against parameter manipulations.

Result: The proposed method shows exceptional robustness on a testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, achieving perfect classification metrics and a near-zero false positive rate. The computation is highly efficient, completing within 30 seconds on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: This approach offers a reliable and efficient solution for model lineage verification, establishing a strong foundation for protecting the intellectual property of LLMs. The availability of the code emphasizes transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial, given the substantial resources required for their training.
Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties
to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an
existing base model. However, the intensive post-training processes that models
typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued
pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and
upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification. In this work,
we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices. We
leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter
manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric. On
a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method
demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned
post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives.
By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach
establishes a strong basis for reliable model lineage verification. Moreover,
the entire computation completes within 30s on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU. The code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a label-free short text clustering method that refines sparse vectors iteratively through LLM guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world scenarios without prior data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of clustering user utterances in chatbot settings without labeled data or prior knowledge of cluster numbers.

Method: The approach involves generating sparse vectors from representative texts and refining them iteratively using guidance from Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: The proposed method achieves results comparable or superior to contrastive learning models, demonstrating its adaptability to a wide range of embedders and settings.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable, resource-efficient solution for real-world text clustering, suitable for diverse datasets and requiring minimal LLM computational resources.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short
text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the
context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts
of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In
these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the
number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector
updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then
iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable
or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning,
but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on
diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and
can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different
clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets,
reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable
settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world
scenarios than existing clustering methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fluency-based, multi-reference evaluation framework for grammatical error correction using $n$-gram similarity, addressing limitations of edit-based and English-centric metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more inclusive and dynamic evaluation method that accounts for the diversity of valid corrections in grammatical error correction, beyond single references.

Method: The framework formulates $n$-gram similarity as a multi-reference aggregation problem and instantiates GLEU with four strategies: select-best, simple-average, weighted-average, and merged-counts, analyzing their theoretical properties.

Result: Empirical tests on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese showed these strategies capture both fluency and correction diversity effectively, complementing each other.

Conclusion: The proposed framework unifies and enhances the evaluation of grammatical corrections by emphasizing fluency and linguistic variation, accommodating multiple valid corrections and multilingual use cases.

Abstract: Evaluating grammatical error correction requires metrics that reflect the
diversity of valid human corrections rather than privileging a single
reference. Existing frameworks, largely edit-based and English-centric, rely on
rigid alignments between system and reference edits, limiting their
applicability in multilingual and generative settings. This paper introduces a
formal framework for \textit{fluency-based multi-reference evaluation}, framing
$n$-gram similarity as an aggregation problem over multiple legitimate
corrections. Within this formulation, we instantiate GLEU through four
aggregation strategies--\textsc{select-best}, \textsc{simple-average},
\textsc{weighted-average}, and \textsc{merged-counts}--and analyze their
properties of boundedness, monotonicity, and sensitivity to reference
variation. Empirical results on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese corpora
show that these strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and
coverage. The framework unifies multi-reference evaluation into a principled,
fluency-oriented approach that incorporates linguistic diversity without
penalizing legitimate variation.

*Jaeseong Lee,Dayoung Kwon,seung-won hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and proposes a lightweight deployment strategy that selectively reduces reasoning during inference to optimize computational efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models, while effective at structured reasoning tasks, tend to overthink, leading to resource inefficiency and performance degradation. Current multi-model deployment solutions can be impractical or expensive, necessitating a more streamlined approach.

Method: The authors propose a training-free, superposed deployment strategy that dynamically switches LRM reasoning capabilities on and off. This involves identifying optimal low-rank projections based on singular value energy analysis, enabling selective unlearning during inference.

Result: The method achieves reduced computational demands while maintaining reasoning quality. Optimal energy-based low-rank projections efficiently tailor LRMs' reasoning depth during task execution.

Conclusion: Selective unlearning using energy-based low-rank projections offers a promising way to enhance LRM efficiency during inference, mitigating overthinking and resource wastage without introducing auxiliary models or incurring heavy computational costs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel in structured tasks by emulating
deliberate human reasoning but often suffer from overthinking, degrading
performance and wasting resources. One possible baseline is to deploy both LLM
and LRM, then route input by predicting whether it requires reasoning and may
cause overthinking. However, deploying multiple models can be costly or
impractical. We propose a superposed deployment strategy with a lightweight,
training-free regulation to optimize inference by switching one model on and
off. Instead of routing, we selectively unlearn from LRM at inference, scaling
down computation while preserving reasoning. By analyzing the cumulative energy
of singular values, we identify optimal low-rank projections to adjust
reasoning just right.

*Lei Xu,Pierre Beckmann,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes an adaptive neuro-symbolic inference framework to combine large language models (LLMs) with formal logical solvers for reasoning, achieving significant accuracy and performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuro-symbolic NLP methods are static, limiting their ability to apply diverse formal reasoning strategies dynamically.

Method: The framework identifies reasoning strategies from natural language problems and selects specialized logical solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Experiments were conducted to evaluate reasoning accuracy and task performance.

Result: The framework predicts reasoning strategies with over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by up to 27%. Gains of up to 10% were observed on reasoning tasks for pure LLM methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive reasoning significantly enhances neuro-symbolic NLP, paving the way for integrating material and formal reasoning across varied challenges.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of
large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches
are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is
predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal
inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive,
multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically
identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural
language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical
solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual
and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are
effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an
accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal
logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines
by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively.
Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods,
yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT
settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive
neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement.
Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic
reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences
on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the systematic extraction of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) using miniGPTKBs, specifically analyzing termination, reproducibility, and robustness across various metrics and variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating and structuring the factual knowledge encoded in LLMs and explore the efficacy of recursive extraction methodologies.

Method: The authors use miniGPTKBs, domain-specific subcrawls, to analyze termination, reproducibility, and robustness of extracted knowledge across variations like seed, language, randomness, and model within domains such as history, entertainment, and finance.

Result: The findings indicate high termination rates (model-dependent), mixed reproducibility, and varying robustness based on perturbation type—high robustness for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and models.

Conclusion: LLM knowledge materialization is effective for surfacing core knowledge but has notable limitations in reproducibility and robustness under certain variations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, yet
measuring and systematizing this knowledge remains challenging. Converting it
into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches
such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key
open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its
outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We
systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs
(domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility,
and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity,
and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language,
randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment,
and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though
model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies
by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and
models. These results suggest that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably
surface core knowledge, while also revealing important limitations.

*Haotian Wu,Shufan Jiang,Chios Chen,Yiyang Feng,Hehai Lin,Heqing Zou,Yao Shu,Yanran Li,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FURINA-Builder, a novel pipeline for creating customizable role-playing (RP) benchmarks, and FURINA-Bench, an evaluation benchmark for large language models (LLMs). Extensive evaluations reveal performance trends and a trade-off between RP quality and hallucination rates in reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for role-playing tasks in LLMs are limited in scope, lack adaptability, and fail to address diverse interaction paradigms. The authors aim to provide a solution that offers broader, scalable, and customizable benchmarking tools.

Method: The paper presents FURINA-Builder, a multi-agent system that simulates RP dialogues using a character-scene pool and an LLM-based judge to construct benchmarks. It generates FURINA-Bench for evaluation, leveraging human assessments and separability analyses to validate the approach.

Result: In evaluations of advanced LLMs, o3 and DeepSeek-R1 exhibited the best RP performance in English and Chinese, respectively. Established characters outperformed synthesized ones, and reasoning amplified this advantage. However, reasoning models showed a trade-off: improved RP performance also led to increased hallucination rates.

Conclusion: FURINA-Builder is effective as a benchmark generator, and FURINA-Bench challenges current LLM capabilities. The findings highlight key trends in LLM role-playing performance and suggest a balancing act between improving reasoning capabilities and minimizing hallucinations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in role-playing (RP) tasks, existing
benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to their narrow scope, outdated
interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FURINA-Builder, a novel
multi-agent collaboration pipeline that automatically constructs fully
customizable RP benchmarks at any scale. It enables evaluation of arbitrary
characters across diverse scenarios and prompt formats, as the first benchmark
builder in RP area for adaptable assessment. FURINA-Builder simulates dialogues
between a test character and other characters drawn from a well-constructed
character-scene pool, while an LLM judge selects fine-grained evaluation
dimensions and adjusts the test character's responses into final test
utterances. Using this pipeline, we build FURINA-Bench, a new comprehensive
role-playing benchmark featuring both established and synthesized test
characters, each assessed with dimension-specific evaluation criteria. Human
evaluation and preliminary separability analysis justify our pipeline and
benchmark design. We conduct extensive evaluations of cutting-edge LLMs and
find that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve the best performance on English and
Chinese RP tasks, respectively. Across all models, established characters
consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning capabilities further
amplifying this disparity. Interestingly, we observe that model scale does not
monotonically reduce hallucinations. More critically, for reasoning LLMs, we
uncover a novel trade-off: reasoning improves RP performance but simultaneously
increases RP hallucinations. This trade-off extends to a broader Pareto
frontier between RP performance and reliability for all LLMs. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder and the challenge posed by
FURINA-Bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study focuses on detecting automatically generated plagiarism in scientific articles using a new dataset and evaluates various approaches, including their generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying automatically generated textual plagiarism in scientific research, especially with the rise of large language models.

Method: Created a novel dataset using three large language models (Llama, DeepSeek-R1, and Mistral). Evaluated participant solutions and baseline methods, comparing results to a 2015 dataset for robustness analysis.

Result: Naive semantic similarity methods achieved high recall (0.8) and moderate precision (0.5) but lacked generalizability to the 2015 dataset.

Conclusion: Current methods for generative plagiarism detection are promising but require improvements in robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: The generative plagiarism detection task at PAN 2025 aims at identifying
automatically generated textual plagiarism in scientific articles and aligning
them with their respective sources. We created a novel large-scale dataset of
automatically generated plagiarism using three large language models: Llama,
DeepSeek-R1, and Mistral. In this task overview paper, we outline the creation
of this dataset, summarize and compare the results of all participants and four
baselines, and evaluate the results on the last plagiarism detection task from
PAN 2015 in order to interpret the robustness of the proposed approaches. We
found that the current iteration does not invite a large variety of approaches
as naive semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors provide
promising results of up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision. In contrast, most of
these approaches underperform significantly on the 2015 dataset, indicating a
lack in generalizability.

*Philipp Mondorf,Mingyang Wang,Sebastian Gerstner,Ahmad Dawar Hakimi,Yihong Liu,Leonor Veloso,Shijia Zhou,Hinrich Schütze,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether combining multiple methods for localizing circuits in large language models improves performance. Both parallel and sequential ensembling approaches are explored, achieving better results compared to individual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance circuit localization within large language models by combining various methods, potentially improving identification precision and benchmark metrics.

Method: The authors apply two ensemble methods: parallel (combining attribution scores across methods) and sequential (using one method’s output as a warm start for another). They evaluate the approaches using benchmark metrics and task combinations.

Result: Both parallel and sequential ensembles show improvement in benchmark metrics, and combining them yields the highest precision for circuit identification.

Conclusion: Ensembling methods provide significant improvements in localizing circuits within LLMs, with a combined approach demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The Circuit Localization track of the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark
(MIB) evaluates methods for localizing circuits within large language models
(LLMs), i.e., subnetworks responsible for specific task behaviors. In this
work, we investigate whether ensembling two or more circuit localization
methods can improve performance. We explore two variants: parallel and
sequential ensembling. In parallel ensembling, we combine attribution scores
assigned to each edge by different methods-e.g., by averaging or taking the
minimum or maximum value. In the sequential ensemble, we use edge attribution
scores obtained via EAP-IG as a warm start for a more expensive but more
precise circuit identification method, namely edge pruning. We observe that
both approaches yield notable gains on the benchmark metrics, leading to a more
precise circuit identification approach. Finally, we find that taking a
parallel ensemble over various methods, including the sequential ensemble,
achieves the best results. We evaluate our approach in the BlackboxNLP 2025 MIB
Shared Task, comparing ensemble scores to official baselines across multiple
model-task combinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTR, a simulation-first training framework, enables tool-augmented reasoning in language models without relying on live APIs. It achieves competitive results in multi-hop QA tasks using structured traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and reliability challenges faced by tool-augmented language models that rely on live API access during training and deployment.

Method: MTR uses a multi-agent architecture with simulated observations, including a ToolMaker, AutoAgent, and ToolActor. Training involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (Stage-1) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (Stage-2).

Result: MTR reached competitive Exact Match scores on four multi-hop QA benchmarks and demonstrated superior performance on reasoning-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: Structured traces can effectively teach tool reasoning without the need for live API interactions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models have demonstrated strong capabilities, but
their reliance on live API access creates scalability and reliability
challenges during training and deployment. We propose MTR, a simulation-first
training framework for tool-augmented reasoning. Instead of relying on live
APIs, MTR learns from complete ReAct traces with schema-validated, simulated
observations. Our approach operates through a multi-agent architecture where a
ToolMaker generates task-specific, OpenAI-compatible tool interfaces, an
AutoAgent produces structured think-act-observe sequences, and a ToolActor
simulates realistic responses. Training proceeds in two stages: Stage-1
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches 'trace grammar' from complete reasoning
sequences; Stage-2 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) optimizes strategy
with a composite trace reward that balances answer correctness and internal
consistency. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue,
2WikiMultiHopQA, Bamboogle), MTR attains competitive Exact Match (EM) scores to
live-API systems and excels on reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting that
effective tool reasoning can be learned from structured traces without live
interactions.

*Kaixiang Mo,Yuxin Shi,Weiwei Weng,Zhiqiang Zhou,Shuman Liu,Haibo Zhang,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the intermediate mid-training stage of LLM development, providing a taxonomy, practical insights, benchmarks, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified survey on the effectiveness and role of mid-training in LLM development despite its widespread use.

Method: Introduced a taxonomy categorizing mid-training techniques into data distribution, learning-rate scheduling, and long-context extension. Additionally, compiled benchmarks, distilled practical insights, and identified challenges.

Result: Reported improved model capabilities and convergence during late training phases while enabling structured comparisons across different models.

Conclusion: Mid-training significantly enhances LLM performance through refined methodologies, and the paper offers a framework for understanding and improving this critical stage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically developed through large-scale
pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Recent advances highlight
the importance of an intermediate mid-training stage, where models undergo
multiple annealing-style phases that refine data quality, adapt optimization
schedules, and extend context length. This stage mitigates diminishing returns
from noisy tokens, stabilizes convergence, and expands model capability in late
training. Its effectiveness can be explained through gradient noise scale, the
information bottleneck, and curriculum learning, which together promote
generalization and abstraction. Despite widespread use in state-of-the-art
systems, there has been no prior survey of mid-training as a unified paradigm.
We introduce the first taxonomy of LLM mid-training spanning data distribution,
learning-rate scheduling, and long-context extension. We distill practical
insights, compile evaluation benchmarks, and report gains to enable structured
comparisons across models. We also identify open challenges and propose avenues
for future research and practice.

*Giorgos Filandrianos,Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis,Wafaa Mohammed,Giuseppe Attanasio,Chrysoula Zerva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias in machine translation quality estimation metrics, introducing a large-scale dataset for bias analysis across diverse languages and occupations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive study on gender bias in automatic quality estimation metrics, which can impact equitable outcomes in machine translation.

Method: The authors created a large-scale challenge set using the GAMBIT corpus, expanding to 33 language pairs, where translations vary only by grammatical gender to examine bias.

Result: The dataset allows for the evaluation of whether QE metrics rate translations differently based on gender, enabling systematic cross-linguistic and occupational bias analysis.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust framework to analyze gender bias in QE metrics, fostering greater transparency and fairness in machine translation technologies.

Abstract: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems has been extensively
documented, but bias in automatic quality estimation (QE) metrics remains
comparatively underexplored. Existing studies suggest that QE metrics can also
exhibit gender bias, yet most analyses are limited by small datasets, narrow
occupational coverage, and restricted language variety. To address this gap, we
introduce a large-scale challenge set specifically designed to probe the
behavior of QE metrics when evaluating translations containing gender-ambiguous
occupational terms. Building on the GAMBIT corpus of English texts with
gender-ambiguous occupations, we extend coverage to three source languages that
are genderless or natural-gendered, and eleven target languages with
grammatical gender, resulting in 33 source-target language pairs. Each source
text is paired with two target versions differing only in the grammatical
gender of the occupational term(s) (masculine vs. feminine), with all dependent
grammatical elements adjusted accordingly. An unbiased QE metric should assign
equal or near-equal scores to both versions. The dataset's scale, breadth, and
fully parallel design, where the same set of texts is aligned across all
languages, enables fine-grained bias analysis by occupation and systematic
comparisons across languages.

*Xuhang Chen,Zhifan Song,Deyi Ji,Shuo Gao,Lanyun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an approach called Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID) which uses internal model signals to enhance multi-LLM debate performance and efficiency, achieving better accuracy and lower token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the performance and efficiency of Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) systems by addressing the neglect of self-signals such as token logits and attention, which are typically overlooked but could improve outcomes.

Method: A new framework called SID is introduced, leveraging self-signals (model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus). These signals allow high-confidence agent exit and redundant debate compression via attention mechanisms.

Result: The proposed SID method surpasses existing MAD techniques in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing token consumption across diverse LLMs and multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The utilization of self-signals in multi-agent debates enhances both performance and computational efficiency, presenting a novel approach to refining multi-LLM systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate
(MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and
refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly
focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using
LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token
logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to
redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we
shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a
Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of
self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to
adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence
agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate
contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various
LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD
techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the
effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and
efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available

TL;DR: The paper investigates and improves large language models (LLMs) for handling discourse phenomena in machine translation using quality-aware decoding (QAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to handle discourse phenomena, such as pronoun resolution and lexical cohesion, in machine translation at the document level.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs for context-aware translation, identifies discourse knowledge within LLMs, and proposes quality-aware decoding (QAD) as a superior decoding strategy.

Result: QAD effectively extracts discourse knowledge, improves the semantic richness of translations, and aligns them more closely with human preferences.

Conclusion: Quality-aware decoding (QAD) reveals discourse knowledge in LLMs and offers better context-aware translations while enhancing semantic richness and meeting human preferences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as strong contenders in machine
translation.Yet, they still struggle to adequately handle discourse phenomena,
such as pronoun resolution and lexical cohesion at the document level. In this
study, we thoroughly investigate the discourse phenomena performance of LLMs in
context-aware translation. We demonstrate that discourse knowledge is encoded
within LLMs and propose the use of quality-aware decoding (QAD) to effectively
extract this knowledge, showcasing its superiority over other decoding
approaches through comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate that QAD
enhances the semantic richness of translations and aligns them more closely
with human preferences.

*Yining Wang,Jinman Zhao,Chuangxin Zhao,Shuhao Guan,Gerald Penn,Shinan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a technique called λ-GRPO to address the length bias issue in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by allowing models to learn token preferences during optimization, resulting in consistent performance improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO, a rule-based method in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), suffers from a length bias as rewards are uniformly distributed across tokens, disproportionately benefiting longer responses. Existing heuristic methods, like DAPO and Dr. GRPO, are not interpretable enough in determining their token weighting preferences, prompting a need for a more adaptive and principled approach.

Method: The authors propose λ-GRPO, a method that introduces a learnable parameter (λ) to dynamically control token-level weighting during optimization. The framework unifies existing methods while allowing the model to determine optimal token preferences, addressing the limitations of prior heuristic approaches.

Result: λ-GRPO outperforms vanilla GRPO and DAPO on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, it achieves improvements of +1.9%, +1.0%, and +1.7% in accuracy, respectively, without requiring additional data or computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed λ-GRPO method effectively resolves the length bias in GRPO by enabling models to learn token preferences during training. The performance gains achieved without increasing computational costs or modifying training data make this method both efficient and practical for enhancing large language model reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the dominant
approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
simplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with
rule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same
advantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result,
longer responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute
disproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.
GRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain
heuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token
preferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to
learn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing
frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter
$\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\lambda$-GRPO
to denote our method, and we find that $\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent
improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\lambda$-GRPO
improves average accuracy by $+1.9\%$, $+1.0\%$, and $+1.7\%$ compared to GRPO,
respectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the
training data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness
and practicality of learning token preferences.

TL;DR: The paper presents MeXtract, lightweight language models for extracting metadata from scientific papers, significantly outperforming benchmarks through fine-tuned adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient metadata extraction remains a challenge, with traditional methods struggling to generalize across domains and schema variations.

Method: The study involved fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 models (0.5B-3B parameters) to create MeXtract, performing evaluations on the enhanced MOLE benchmark.

Result: MeXtract achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on the MOLE benchmark and demonstrated effective schema adaptation, even for unseen schemas.

Conclusion: MeXtract represents robust, adaptable, and openly available tools for metadata extraction in scientific literature.

Abstract: Metadata plays a critical role in indexing, documenting, and analyzing
scientific literature, yet extracting it accurately and efficiently remains a
challenging task. Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or
task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema
variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight
language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The
models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5
counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art
performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support
evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific
metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show
that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also
transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and
adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models
openly for the research community.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Long-RewardBench, a benchmark for evaluating reward models (RMs) under long-context scenarios, highlighting their limitations and proposing a multi-stage training strategy to enhance long-context consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models for aligning large language models focus on short-context and response-level attributes, but fail in long-context scenarios critical for real-world applications.

Method: The authors developed Long-RewardBench benchmark and proposed a multi-stage training strategy to improve reward model robustness for long-context scenarios.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvement in long-context evaluation performance, with their LongRM model surpassing larger models like 70B-scale baselines and proprietary alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances long-context RM capability while preserving short-context performance, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM)
with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long
history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate
whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and
consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to
short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g.,
safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long
context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a
benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both
Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that
even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in
long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments.
Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we
propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales
arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that
our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context
evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B
LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance
of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHANKS is a framework enabling spoken language models (SLMs) to think and act in real-time during user input, enhancing responsiveness and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and SLMs start processing only after the user finishes speaking, causing delays and being unsuitable for real-time speech-to-speech interactions.

Method: SHANKS processes streamed speech in fixed-duration chunks, generating reasoning during the user's input, making decisions like interruptions or tool calls.

Result: In math problem-solving, SHANKS achieved 37.1% better interruption accuracy; in tool dialogues, it completed 56.9% of tool calls before the user finished speaking.

Conclusion: SHANKS improves real-time interaction by enabling continuous reasoning during conversations, moving towards more dynamic spoken AI models.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin
thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This
prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high
response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after
receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,
where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting
that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose
SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken
chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams
the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,
generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while
the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide
whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We
demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two
scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math
problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a
mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that
interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can
complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall,
SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not
only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve ASR evaluation by addressing the lack of diverse datasets (multilingual, long-form) and efficiency metrics.

Method: Standardize text normalization and compare systems using word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx) across 60+ systems on 11 datasets.

Result: Conformer-LLM decoders excel in WER but are slower; CTC and TDT decoders excel in efficiency, with trade-offs for Whisper-derived multilingual models.

Conclusion: Open-sourced benchmark and tools enable fair ASR evaluation targeting diverse tasks and priorities, transparency, and extensibility.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form
English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR
Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard
comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including
dedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization
and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx),
enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription,
Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but
are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them
attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned
for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All
code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to generate customizable and standards-aligned math word problems (MWPs) to enhance math education efficiency and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teachers face challenges such as limited time and burnout when personalizing MWPs for students, creating a need for automated solutions customized to students' interests and academic standards.

Method: A joint human expert-LLM judging approach was used to evaluate over 11,000 generated MWPs. Teacher-annotated datasets were created and used to train models, including open-source LLMs and text classifiers to improve performance for generating educational MWPs.

Result: The study demonstrated that a 12B open model, trained on teacher-annotated data, matches larger open models in performance. A 30B open model outperformed existing baselines in MWP customization using a trained text classifier. The generated MWPs were more human-like than existing models.

Conclusion: Customized LLM-generated MWPs are as effective as human-written MWPs for grade school students, with students showing a preference for the tailored problems created by the models.

Abstract: Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and
customizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase
learning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs
for each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose
that LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student
interests and math education standards. To this end, we use a joint human
expert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and
closed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for
standards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by
using it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and
more capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a
text classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed
baselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar
to human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by
conducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school
students, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to

### [102] [Probing Social Identity Bias in Chinese LLMs with Gendered Pronouns and Social Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06974)
*Geng Liu,Feng Li,Junjie Mu,Mengxiao Zhu,Francesco Pierri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines social identity biases in Chinese language models, showing systematic ingroup-outgroup tendencies across synthetic and real conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the social biases in Chinese large language models (LLMs), especially how these biases manifest during user interactions, as prior research has mostly focused on English LLMs.

Method: The authors use Mandarin-specific prompts to test ingroup ('We') and outgroup ('They') biases across ten Chinese LLMs, expanding the analysis to 240 social groups. They also analyze real user-chatbot conversations to corroborate findings.

Result: The study finds systematic tendencies towards ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity, observed both in controlled experiments and real-world conversations.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights linguistic and contextual biases in Chinese LLMs. The findings suggest that biases transfer across languages and may intensify in practical applications, providing an evaluation framework for future studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in user-facing
applications, raising concerns about their potential to reflect and amplify
social biases. We investigate social identity framing in Chinese LLMs using
Mandarin-specific prompts across ten representative Chinese LLMs, evaluating
responses to ingroup ("We") and outgroup ("They") framings, and extending the
setting to 240 social groups salient in the Chinese context. To complement
controlled experiments, we further analyze Chinese-language conversations from
a corpus of real interactions between users and chatbots. Across models, we
observe systematic ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative tendencies, which are
not confined to synthetic prompts but also appear in naturalistic dialogue,
indicating that bias dynamics might strengthen in real interactions. Our study
provides a language-aware evaluation framework for Chinese LLMs, demonstrating
that social identity biases documented in English generalize
cross-linguistically and intensify in user-facing contexts.

### [103] [Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999)
*Markus Reuter,Tobias Lingenberg,Rūta Liepiņa,Francesca Lagioia,Marco Lippi,Giovanni Sartor,Andrea Passerini,Burcu Sayin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the critical failure mode of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in legal applications, introducing a method called Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC) to mitigate mismatched document retrieval errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs for legal applications caused by the retrieval of incorrect source documents, a frequent problem due to structural similarity in large legal databases.

Method: The method proposed involves Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC), which enriches text chunks with synthetic document-level summaries to retain global context that is otherwise lost during chunking.

Result: Experiments on diverse legal retrieval tasks show that SAC reduces document retrieval mismatch (DRM), improves text-level precision and recall, and that generic summarization outperforms legal-expert-targeted strategies.

Conclusion: Summary-Augmented Chunking is a practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique that improves the reliability of RAG systems in the context of large-scale legal document datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its
reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This
is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of
structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this
paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a
critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where
the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To
mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique
which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances
each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting
crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking
process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks
show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level
retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic
summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert
domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence
that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the
reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of multilingual coverage and diversity in datasets for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for Indian languages. To tackle this, the authors propose a pipeline to curate diverse post-training data in Indian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing post-training datasets, especially gaps in multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and task diversity for Indian languages.

Method: They develop a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining translations and synthetic expansion to generate diverse Indic post-training data.

Result: Using this pipeline, two datasets were curated: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K examples) and Pragyaan-Align (100K examples) across 10 Indian languages, encompassing various categories and datasets.

Conclusion: The datasets provide crucial resources to enhance inclusivity and effectiveness in training multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs).

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the
availability of high-quality post-training data, particularly
instruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source
datasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and
suffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian
languages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations
with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training
data. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and
Pragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56
sub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol
incorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity,
multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation
of cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective
multilingual LLMs.

### [105] [Native Hybrid Attention for Efficient Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07019)
*Jusen Du,Jiaxi Hu,Tao Zhang,Weigao Sun,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Native Hybrid Attention (NHA), a fusion of linear and full attention for improved efficiency and recall accuracy in sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of quadratic complexity in transformers while preserving recall accuracy over long contexts.

Method: NHA combines linear attention with full attention into a unified architecture, using a linear RNN for key-value slots and a sliding window for short-term tokens. A single softmax attention operation is applied to both, controlled by a sliding window hyperparameter.

Result: NHA outperforms traditional transformers and hybrid baselines on recall and commonsense reasoning tasks, while enabling structural integration into pre-trained Large Language Models for improved efficiency.

Conclusion: NHA offers a scalable and efficient solution for sequence modeling, delivering competitive accuracy and significant efficiency gains, making it a superior choice for recall-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while
linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall
accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention
(NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates
both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA
maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and
augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single
\texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values,
enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring
additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a
single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment
between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally
uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other
hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks.
Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving
competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is
available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

*Shrestha Ghosh,Luca Giordano,Yujia Hu,Tuan-Phong Nguyen,Simon Razniewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the factual knowledge of a leading Language Model (GPT-4.1), using the GPTKB v1.5 dataset, uncovering significant inaccuracies and issues such as inconsistency and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and understand the factual knowledge embedded in advanced LLMs like GPT-4.1 and address the shortcomings of biased evaluations in previous studies.

Method: Analyzed GPTKB v1.5 dataset containing 100 million beliefs, which were elicited from recursive querying of GPT-4.1, comparing its knowledge to existing knowledge bases.

Result: Found discrepancies in factual accuracy compared to established knowledge bases, alongside major challenges like inconsistency, ambiguity, and hallucinations.

Conclusion: While GPT-4.1 demonstrates significant factual knowledge, it has notable gaps and issues, highlighting the need for further research to improve reliability and alignment with ground truth data.

Abstract: LLMs are remarkable artifacts that have revolutionized a range of NLP and AI
tasks. A significant contributor is their factual knowledge, which, to date,
remains poorly understood, and is usually analyzed from biased samples. In this
paper, we take a deep tour into the factual knowledge (or beliefs) of a
frontier LLM, based on GPTKB v1.5 (Hu et al., 2025a), a recursively elicited
set of 100 million beliefs of one of the strongest currently available frontier
LLMs, GPT-4.1. We find that the models' factual knowledge differs quite
significantly from established knowledge bases, and that its accuracy is
significantly lower than indicated by previous benchmarks. We also find that
inconsistency, ambiguity and hallucinations are major issues, shedding light on
future research opportunities concerning factual LLM knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address difficulties LLMs encounter with code-switching due to language mixing, limited datasets, and biased evaluations, impacting deployment in multilingual societies.

Method: Comprehensive review of studies involving LLM research in code-switching, including classification of advances by architecture, training strategies, and evaluation methodologies.

Result: Identified recent progress in LLM-driven code-switching modeling and persistent challenges like dataset inclusivity, biased evaluation, and linguistic gaps.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluations, and linguistically grounded models to improve multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Code-switching (CSW), the alternation of languages and scripts within a
single utterance, remains a fundamental challenge for multiling ual NLP, even
amidst the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs). Most LLMs still
struggle with mixed-language inputs, limited CSW datasets, and evaluation
biases, hindering deployment in multilingual societies. This survey provides

\total{unique_references} studies spanning five research areas, 12 NLP tasks,
30+ datasets, and 80+ languages. We classify recent advances by architecture,
training strategy, and evaluation methodology, outlining how LLMs have reshaped
CSW modeling and what challenges persist. The paper concludes with a roadmap
emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluation, and
linguistically grounded models to achieve truly multilingual intelligence. A

### [108] [Search-R3: Unifying Reasoning and Embedding Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07048)
*Yuntao Gui,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-R3 uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance retrieval tasks by generating improved search embeddings during their reasoning process, employing supervised learning and reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their strong natural language understanding, LLMs are underused for retrieval tasks. This paper aims to leverage their reasoning ability to improve embedding generation for retrieval.

Method: Search-R3 involves three mechanisms: (1) supervised learning for quality embeddings, (2) reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning and embedding generation, and (3) an RL environment that avoids corpus re-encoding during training iterations.

Result: Search-R3 outperforms prior methods on diverse benchmarks with its unified approach to reasoning and embedding generation.

Conclusion: This framework advances knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating complex reasoning with effective retrieval processes, enhancing both embedding quality and retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been underutilized for retrieval tasks. We present
Search-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to
generate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our
approach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce
more effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic
analyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a
supervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality
embeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes
embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment
that efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring
complete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive
evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly
outperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation
processes. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial
advancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both
sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval. Project page:

*Miriam Wanner,Sophia Hager,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the shift in coverage priorities of local news stations after acquisition by Sinclair Broadcast Group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the takeover of local news stations by the Sinclair Broadcast Group influences their reporting content and priorities, especially with respect to balancing local and national topics.

Method: The study employs computational methods to analyze the content changes in local news internet output before and after their acquisition by Sinclair, and compares it to national news content.

Result: Local news stations acquired by Sinclair focus more on national news, reducing their local issue coverage while increasing the frequency of polarizing topics.

Conclusion: Sinclair’s acquisitions lead to a shift in local news stations' coverage, making them more similar to national outlets and diminishing their focus on local concerns.

Abstract: Local news stations are often considered to be reliable sources of
non-politicized information, particularly local concerns that residents care
about. Because these stations are trusted news sources, viewers are
particularly susceptible to the information they report. The Sinclair Broadcast
group is a broadcasting company that has acquired many local news stations in
the last decade. We investigate the effects of local news stations being
acquired by Sinclair: how does coverage change? We use computational methods to
investigate changes in internet content put out by local news stations before
and after being acquired by Sinclair and in comparison to national news
outlets. We find that there is clear evidence that local news stations report
more frequently on national news at the expense of local topics, and that their
coverage of polarizing national topics increases.

*Amir Hossein Yari,Kalmit Kulkarni,Ahmad Raza Khan,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ITEM, a benchmark to evaluate the performance of automatic metrics on Indian languages in Machine Translation (MT) and Text Summarization (TS). It reveals insights on metric-human alignment and robustness across diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic metrics are primarily validated for English and high-resource languages, overlooking Indian languages spoken by 1.5 billion people. This gap questions the universality of evaluation practices.

Method: ITEM benchmark systematically evaluates 26 metrics across six Indian languages, focusing on agreement with human judgments, sensitivity to outliers, reliability, metric correlation, and resilience to perturbations.

Result: LLM-based evaluators align closely with human judgments. TS metrics capture content fidelity better than MT metrics, which excel in fluency. Outliers impact human-metric agreement significantly and metrics showcase varying robustness against perturbations.

Conclusion: Findings guide improvements in metric design and evaluation, emphasizing the need for attention towards Indian languages to ensure universal applicability.

Abstract: While automatic metrics drive progress in Machine Translation (MT) and Text
Summarization (TS), existing metrics have been developed and validated almost
exclusively for English and other high-resource languages. This narrow focus
leaves Indian languages, spoken by over 1.5 billion people, largely overlooked,
casting doubt on the universality of current evaluation practices. To address
this gap, we introduce ITEM, a large-scale benchmark that systematically
evaluates the alignment of 26 automatic metrics with human judgments across six
major Indian languages, enriched with fine-grained annotations. Our extensive
evaluation, covering agreement with human judgments, sensitivity to outliers,
language-specific reliability, inter-metric correlations, and resilience to
controlled perturbations, reveals four central findings: (1) LLM-based
evaluators show the strongest alignment with human judgments at both segment
and system levels; (2) outliers exert a significant impact on metric-human
agreement; (3) in TS, metrics are more effective at capturing content fidelity,
whereas in MT, they better reflect fluency; and (4) metrics differ in their
robustness and sensitivity when subjected to diverse perturbations.
Collectively, these findings offer critical guidance for advancing metric
design and evaluation in Indian languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for creating a cross-lingual instruction dataset for Luxembourgish without relying on machine translation, using data from English, French, and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality instruction datasets for low-resource languages like Luxembourgish and to avoid issues from machine translations such as semantic misalignment and cultural inaccuracies.

Method: Developing a cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset by leveraging aligned datasets from English, French, and German, avoiding machine-generated translations.

Result: Cross-lingual instruction tuning improves both representational alignment across languages and generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual data curation can sidestep the pitfalls of machine translation and significantly aid the development of resources for low-resource languages like Luxembourgish.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a key technique for enhancing the performance
of large language models, enabling them to better follow human prompts.
However, low-resource languages such as Luxembourgish face severe limitations
due to the lack of high-quality instruction datasets. Traditional reliance on
machine translation often introduces semantic misalignment and cultural
inaccuracies. In this work, we address these challenges by creating a
cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish, without resorting
to machine-generated translations into it. Instead, by leveraging aligned data
from English, French, and German, we build a high-quality dataset that
preserves linguistic and cultural nuances. We provide evidence that
cross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment
across languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.
This highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls
of machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language
development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LocalLeap, a training-free adaptive parallel decoding strategy for diffusion large language models (dLLMs) that significantly improves inference speed by reducing redundant decoding steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in dLLMs caused by delayed decoding during parallel token generation, which impacts practical deployment due to quality-speed trade-offs.

Method: LocalLeap leverages local determinism propagation and progressive spatial consistency decay principles to anchor high-confidence tokens and perform efficient parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods.

Result: LocalLeap boosts throughput by 6.94×, reduces decoding steps to 14.2% of the original requirement, and maintains comparable performance quality.

Conclusion: LocalLeap is an effective solution for enhancing inference efficiency in dLLMs without compromising text generation quality, improving practical applicability and performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) represent a significant advancement
in text generation, offering parallel token decoding capabilities. However,
existing open-source implementations suffer from quality-speed trade-offs that
impede their practical deployment. Conservative sampling strategies typically
decode only the most confident token per step to ensure quality (i.e., greedy
decoding), at the cost of inference efficiency due to repeated redundant
refinement iterations--a phenomenon we term delayed decoding. Through
systematic analysis of dLLM decoding dynamics, we characterize this delayed
decoding behavior and propose a training-free adaptive parallel decoding
strategy, named LocalLeap, to address these inefficiencies. LocalLeap is built
on two fundamental empirical principles: local determinism propagation centered
on high-confidence anchors and progressive spatial consistency decay. By
applying these principles, LocalLeap identifies anchors and performs localized
relaxed parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods, achieving substantial
inference step reduction through early commitment of already-determined tokens
without compromising output quality. Comprehensive evaluation on various
benchmarks demonstrates that LocalLeap achieves 6.94$\times$ throughput
improvements and reduces decoding steps to just 14.2\% of the original
requirement, achieving these gains with negligible performance impact. The
source codes are available at: https://github.com/friedrichor/LocalLeap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VITALERRORS, a dataset exposing weaknesses in existing metrics for evaluating the factuality of key information in LLMs, and proposes a new metric, VITAL, to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating the factuality of LLM responses fail to differentiate between key and peripheral information, leading to unreliable assessments when critical errors occur.

Method: The authors created VITALERRORS, a dataset with 6,733 minimally altered LLM responses focusing on omissions or falsifications of key information, and developed the VITAL metrics to prioritize the relevance and importance of claims.

Result: VITAL metrics demonstrated improved sensitivity to key information errors when compared to existing evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The dataset, metrics, and analysis provided by the authors offer a stronger foundation for accurately and effectively assessing the factuality of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the factuality of large language model (LLM)
responses treat all claims as equally important. This results in misleading
evaluations when vital information is missing or incorrect as it receives the
same weight as peripheral details, raising the question: how can we reliably
detect such differences when there are errors in key information? Current
approaches that measure factuality tend to be insensitive to omitted or false
key information. To investigate this lack of sensitivity, we construct
VITALERRORS, a benchmark of 6,733 queries with minimally altered LLM responses
designed to omit or falsify key information. Using this dataset, we demonstrate
the insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors.
To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a set of metrics that provide greater
sensitivity in measuring the factuality of responses by incorporating the
relevance and importance of claims with respect to the query. Our analysis
demonstrates that VITAL metrics more reliably detect errors in key information
than previous methods. Our dataset, metrics, and analysis provide a foundation
for more accurate and robust assessment of LLM factuality.

*Zhu Li,Yuqing Zhang,Xiyuan Gao,Shekhar Nayak,Matt Coler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis by integrating fine-tuned LLaMA 3 semantic embeddings and prosodic exemplars within a VITS system, outperforming baselines in naturalness and expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm, as a complex and subtle form of non-literal communication, has been largely overlooked in speech synthesis research, which has primarily focused on broader emotional categories.

Method: The authors propose a framework by combining semantic embeddings from a fine-tuned LLaMA 3 model that capture sarcasm-related cues, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module for prosodic retrieval patterns. These components are integrated within a VITS architecture.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements over baselines in both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, particularly in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and helping downstream sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of generating sarcastic speech, marking a step forward in both the expressivity and contextual appropriateness of synthesized voices.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant
challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic,
contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has
focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach
combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture
pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic
exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which
provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within
a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually
appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations,
yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and
downstream sarcasm detection.

*Guo Yutong,Wanying Wang,Yue Wu,Zichen Miao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TALENT, a lightweight framework for Table Visual Question Answering (Table VQA), combining small vision-language models (VLMs) with large language models (LLMs) for efficient multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models are computationally heavy and often miss fine-grained details, making them unsuitable for cost-efficient scenarios like mobile deployment. Alternatives like structured outputs still lead to errors.

Method: TALENT employs a small VLM to generate OCR text and natural language narrations, which are combined with questions for reasoning by an LLM. This shifts Table VQA to an LLM-centric multimodal problem.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TALENT enables small VLM-LLM frameworks to achieve or exceed the performance of large VLMs on both established and a new, more challenging dataset (ReTabVQA).

Conclusion: TALENT offers an efficient and computationally scalable solution for Table VQA tasks, proving effective without the need for expensive large VLMs while introducing a challenging new dataset for future research.

Abstract: Table Visual Question Answering (Table VQA) is typically addressed by large
vision-language models (VLMs). While such models can answer directly from
images, they often miss fine-grained details unless scaled to very large sizes,
which are computationally prohibitive, especially for mobile deployment. A
lighter alternative is to have a small VLM perform OCR and then use a large
language model (LLM) to reason over structured outputs such as Markdown tables.
However, these representations are not naturally optimized for LLMs and still
introduce substantial errors. We propose TALENT (Table VQA via Augmented
Language-Enhanced Natural-text Transcription), a lightweight framework that
leverages dual representations of tables. TALENT prompts a small VLM to produce
both OCR text and natural language narration, then combines them with the
question for reasoning by an LLM. This reframes Table VQA as an LLM-centric
multimodal reasoning task, where the VLM serves as a perception-narration
module rather than a monolithic solver. Additionally, we construct ReTabVQA, a
more challenging Table VQA dataset requiring multi-step quantitative reasoning
over table images. Experiments show that TALENT enables a small VLM-LLM
combination to match or surpass a single large VLM at significantly lower
computational cost on both public datasets and ReTabVQA.

*Taylor Sorensen,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for modeling human variation in NLP tasks, using language models and meta-learning for improved performance in subjective or ambiguous scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of subjectivity and annotation disagreements in NLP tasks by developing a system that can model and adapt to human variation.

Method: Utilize language models with in-context learning, combined with two-step meta-learning: post-training on multiple datasets and specialization to specific data distributions. Integrate rater examples and dataset-specific fine-tuning.

Result: The system won both tasks in the LeWiDi competition and showed effectiveness in leveraging scale, rater examples, and dataset post-training.

Conclusion: Rater examples, dataset-specific fine-tuning, and post-training enhance performance, and scaling the model further improves its ability to understand disagreement and ambiguity in NLP.

Abstract: Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks involve subjectivity, ambiguity,
or legitimate disagreement between annotators. In this paper, we outline our
system for modeling human variation. Our system leverages language models'
(LLMs) in-context learning abilities, along with a two-step meta-learning
training procedure for 1) post-training on many datasets requiring in-context
learning and 2) specializing the model via in-context meta-learning to the
particular data distribution of interest. We also evaluate the performance of
our system submission to the Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) competition,
where it was the overall winner on both tasks. Additionally, we perform an
ablation study to measure the importance of each system component. We find that
including rater examples in-context is crucial for our system's performance,
dataset-specific fine-tuning is helpful on the larger datasets, post-training
on other in-context datasets is helpful on one of the competition datasets, and
that performance improves with model scale.

*Manish Nagaraj,Sakshi Choudhary,Utkarsh Saxena,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIM is a token-centric framework that identifies high-quality subsets (coresets) for instruction-tuning LLMs, outperforming baseline methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) perform better with instruction tuning, but identifying small, high-quality datasets (coresets) for this purpose is difficult and resource-intensive.

Method: TRIM uses attention-derived 'fingerprints' to match representational patterns of target samples, avoiding computationally expensive gradient calculations while focusing on token-level structural features.

Result: TRIM-selected coresets provide up to 9% improvement in downstream task performance compared to state-of-the-art methods and even outperform full dataset fine-tuning in some cases.

Conclusion: TRIM is a scalable, efficient alternative for designing instruction-tuning datasets, delivering superior results at lower computational costs.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small,
high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior
results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely
on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is
computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this,
we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a
forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM
operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via
attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples. Such an
approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural
features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently
outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even
surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding
expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the
computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient
alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.

### [118] [Comparing human and language models sentence processing difficulties on complex structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07141)
*Samuel Joseph Amouyal,Aya Meltzer-Asscher,Jonathan Berant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares human sentence comprehension against large language models (LLMs), focusing on seven challenging linguistic structures, revealing that LLMs face difficulties particularly with garden path sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore similarities and differences in sentence comprehension between humans and LLMs, especially under challenging linguistic conditions, and assess the language processing capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Researchers employed a unified experimental framework to collect sentence comprehension data across humans and five families of LLMs, measuring performance both on complex target structures and matched baseline sentences.

Result: LLMs overall struggle with target linguistic structures, particularly garden path sentences, achieving varied performance levels depending on model strength. For example, GPT-5 achieves 93.7% accuracy for non-GP structures but only 46.8% for GP structures.

Conclusion: The study identifies parallels and distinctions between human and LLM comprehension, providing insights into the progression of LLMs and their human-like language processing challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that fluently converse with humans are a reality
- but do LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties? We systematically
compare human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging
linguistic structures. We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and
five families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure
in a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on
the target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed,
while the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures
(93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5).
Additionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank
correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each
target structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the
difficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline
sentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two
exceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across
both sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is
uniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and
LLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans
and LLMs.

### [119] [Reasoning for Hierarchical Text Classification: The Case of Patents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07167)
*Lekang Jiang,Wenjun Sun,Stephan Goetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework for hierarchical text classification aimed at automating complex tasks like patent classification through step-by-step reasoning using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical text classification, particularly for patents, is challenging due to domain knowledge complexity and a large number of labels. Prior methods offer limited insights and flat-label outputs.

Method: RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: first, a cold-start stage aligning outputs with chain-of-thought reasoning format, and second, a reinforcement learning stage enhancing step-by-step reasoning capabilities.

Result: RHC achieves higher accuracy and macro F1 scores (approximately 3% improvement), offers explainable predictions, scales well with larger models, and performs effectively on other HTC benchmarks beyond patents.

Conclusion: The proposed RHC framework improves HTC tasks through enhanced reasoning, better scalability, and broader applicability, providing both effectiveness and explainability.

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels
of a pre-defined taxonomy. Automated patent subject classification represents
one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a
huge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which
offers little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose
Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that
reformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce
hierarchical labels. RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a
cold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
format and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning
ability. RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments. (1)
Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised
fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1. (2)
Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction
to facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with
model size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4)
Applicability: Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which
highlights its broad applicability.

*Yike Zhao,Simin Guo,Ziqing Yang,Shifan Han,Dahua Lin,Fei Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates open-source datasets and data synthesis techniques for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing the importance of data quality over quantity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the dependence of LLM reasoning capabilities on the training data quality and explore best practices for data construction to improve real-world applications.

Method: The study involved analyzing datasets and synthesis techniques through a unified training and deployment pipeline, distilling effective data selection strategies, and identifying industrially applicable methods.

Result: The analysis revealed that interpretable data formats and distillation from stronger models are more effective than merely increasing data volume, providing insights for improving LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Quality data structuring and strategic selection outweigh scaling up data quantity for improving LLM reasoning abilities, offering guidance for practical data curation and model development efforts.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical
role in many downstream tasks, yet depend strongly on the quality of training
data. Despite various proposed data construction methods, their practical
utility in real-world pipelines remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct
a comprehensive analysis of open-source datasets and data synthesis techniques
for mathematical reasoning, evaluating them under a unified pipeline designed
to mirror training and deployment scenarios. We further distill effective data
selection strategies and identify practical methods suitable for industrial
applications. Our findings highlight that structuring data in more
interpretable formats, or distilling from stronger models often outweighs
simply scaling up data volume. This study provides actionable guidance for
integrating training data to enhance LLM capabilities, supporting both
cost-effective data curation and scalable model enhancement. We hope this work
will inspire further research on how to balance "more data" versus "better
data" for real-world reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NurseLLM, a nursing-specialized language model designed for multiple choice question-answering tasks, along with a nursing-specific dataset and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models are underutilized in specialized domains like nursing, thus the authors aim to address this gap.

Method: A multi-stage data generation pipeline was created to develop a large-scale nursing MCQ dataset, combined with the design of nursing benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: NurseLLM outperforms state-of-the-art general and medical-specialized language models on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Specialized LLMs tailored for nursing hold significant promise for both improving performance on task-specific evaluations and advancing capabilities like reasoning and collaboration within the nursing domain.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
transformed medical systems. However, their potential within specialized
domains such as nursing remains largely underexplored. In this work, we
introduce NurseLLM, the first nursing-specialized LLM tailored for multiple
choice question-answering (MCQ) tasks. We develop a multi-stage data generation
pipeline to build the first large scale nursing MCQ dataset to train LLMs on a
broad spectrum of nursing topics. We further introduce multiple nursing
benchmarks to enable rigorous evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that NurseLLM outperforms SoTA general-purpose and medical-specialized LLMs of
comparable size on different benchmarks, underscoring the importance of a
specialized LLM for the nursing domain. Finally, we explore the role of
reasoning and multi-agent collaboration systems in nursing, highlighting their
promise for future research and applications.

### [122] [Quantifying Data Contamination in Psychometric Evaluations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07175)
*Jongwook Han,Woojung Song,Jonggeun Lee,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes a framework to measure data contamination in psychometric assessments of Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing significant contamination in widely used inventories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, which threaten the reliability of psychological assessments.

Method: A framework was developed to measure three dimensions of contamination: item memorization, evaluation memorization, and target score matching. It was applied to 21 LLMs across four psychometric inventories, including the Big Five and Portrait Values.

Result: Findings show substantial contamination in popular psychometric inventories, with models memorizing items and adjusting responses to align with specific target scores.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for caution in using standard psychometric inventories on LLMs and calls for addressing contamination issues in future research.

Abstract: Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models
(LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values,
personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised
concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which
may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic
attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in
psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item
memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching.
Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used
psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as
the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40)
exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also
adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

*Yong-En Tian,Yu-Chien Tang,An-Zi Yen,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARPAS, a task where systems adjust given aspects according to document context before summarization, using large language models and proposing strategies to enhance relevance in generated summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in real-world summarization scenarios where predefined aspects might be incomplete, irrelevant, or missing, and enable systems to adjust and refine aspects dynamically.

Method: Developed CARPAS and collected three datasets for experiments. Used large language models with four prompting strategies to analyze aspect prediction. Proposed a subtask to determine the optimal number of relevant aspects before summarization.

Result: Experiments revealed that predicting the number of relevant aspects improves LLM summarization accuracy and relevance. Misalignment between predicted and provided aspects was addressed effectively in all datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CARPAS framework and methodologies significantly enhance summarization quality and underline the importance of aspect predictions tailored to document content. Useful insights for deploying LLMs in real-world tasks were established.

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization has attracted significant attention for its
ability to generate more fine-grained and user-aligned summaries. While most
existing approaches assume a set of predefined aspects as input, real-world
scenarios often present challenges where these given aspects may be incomplete,
irrelevant, or entirely missing from the document. Users frequently expect
systems to adaptively refine or filter the provided aspects based on the actual
content. In this paper, we initiate this novel task setting, termed
Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization (CARPAS), with
the aim of dynamically adjusting the provided aspects based on the document
context before summarizing. We construct three new datasets to facilitate our
pilot experiments, and by using LLMs with four representative prompting
strategies in this task, we find that LLMs tend to predict an overly
comprehensive set of aspects, which often results in excessively long and
misaligned summaries. Building on this observation, we propose a preliminary
subtask to predict the number of relevant aspects, and demonstrate that the
predicted number can serve as effective guidance for the LLMs, reducing the
inference difficulty, and enabling them to focus on the most pertinent aspects.
Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly
improves performance across all datasets. Moreover, our deeper analyses uncover
LLMs' compliance when the requested number of aspects differs from their own
estimations, establishing a crucial insight for the deployment of LLMs in
similar real-world applications.

*Imry Ziv,Nur Lan,Emmanuel Chemla,Roni Katzir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates if large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 can differentiate between humanly possible and impossible languages and concludes they cannot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs share the same innate learning biases as humans, which influence human language typology.

Method: Analyzed GPT-2's learning behavior on datasets of natural languages and their artificially created 'impossible' counterparts using metrics derived from model perplexity curves.

Result: Found that GPT-2 learned both natural and 'impossible' languages with similar ease, suggesting LLMs do not systemically distinguish between these categories.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-2 do not exhibit the human innate learning biases required to differentiate between possible and impossible languages.

Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanly
possible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken by
many to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases.
Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLM
learning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasets
derived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the same
methodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossible
perturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and its
impossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We also
apply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind of
separation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set of
impossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in various
metrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides no
systematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together,
these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases that
shape linguistic typology.

TL;DR: The paper discusses language technology advancements focusing on Uganda's diverse linguistic landscape, introducing Sunflower models for improved language comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of language technology for Africa’s 2000+ languages, particularly highlighting the inefficiency of leading LLMs’ focus on major languages.

Method: The researchers developed Sunflower 14B and 32B models based on Qwen 3, specifically tailored for most Ugandan languages.

Result: The models achieved state-of-the-art comprehension performance across a majority of Ugandan languages, making them useful for practical applications.

Conclusion: Sunflower models provide a more inclusive, regionally focused solution to reduce language barriers, promoting open-source accessibility for linguistic diversity.

Abstract: There are more than 2000 living languages in Africa, most of which have been
bypassed by advances in language technology. Current leading LLMs exhibit
strong performance on a number of the most common languages (e.g. Swahili or
Yoruba), but prioritise support for the languages with the most speakers first,
resulting in piecemeal ability across disparate languages. We contend that a
regionally focussed approach is more efficient, and present a case study for
Uganda, a country with high linguistic diversity. We describe the development
of Sunflower 14B and 32B, a pair of models based on Qwen 3 with state of the
art comprehension in the majority of all Ugandan languages. These models are
open source and can be used to reduce language barriers in a number of
important practical applications.

*Chengzhi Zhong,Fei Cheng,Qianying Liu,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu,Sadao Kurohashi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the cross-lingual transition in large language models and introduces a method to manipulate specific dimensions for language control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating how large language models handle multilingual content and identifying ways to control their behavior for multilingual generation tasks.

Method: A training-free technique that identifies and manipulates sparse dimensions related to cross-lingual transitions using small amounts of data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that interventions in the identified dimensions enable language output control while maintaining semantic content. It outperforms prior neuron-based methods with fewer resources.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the interpretability of dimensions in multilingual modeling and establish an efficient, effective method for controlled multilingual generation.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities despite
limited exposure to non-English data. Prior studies show that English-centric
large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned
representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into
target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we
hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and
sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the
intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple,
training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring
only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments
on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these
dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch
the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses
the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates OpenAI's Whisper for low-resource African ASR, finding that 50-200 hours of training data enables viable performance, and emphasizes the role of data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the development and deployment of ASR systems for low-resource African languages given the challenges posed by limited transcribed speech data.

Method: The study involves systematic data scaling experiments on Kinyarwanda (1-1,400 hours of training data) and error analysis on Kikuyu using 270 hours of data, employing the Whisper model.

Result: The study shows that Whisper achieves practical ASR performance with 50 hours of training data (WER < 13%) and further improvement with 200 hours (WER < 10%). Data quality issues accounted for 38.6% of major errors.

Conclusion: Robust ASR systems for low-resource languages require not just adequate data volumes but also careful data quality management. These findings help set performance benchmarks and deployment strategies for similar linguistic contexts.

Abstract: The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for
low-resource African languages remains challenging due to limited transcribed
speech data. While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's
Whisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical
questions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper
addresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum
data volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary
failure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's
performance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages:
systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to
1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of
training data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR
performance (WER < 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of
training data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER
< 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis
reveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth
transcriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful
data curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance.
These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams
developing ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts. We

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-efficient framework for pretraining small language models (SLMs), utilizing sparse sub-networks, evolutionary search, and knowledge distillation techniques for optimized performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more resource-efficient alternative to large language models (LLMs) by improving the pretraining process of small language models (SLMs), making them both accessible and efficient.

Method: The paper integrates three methods: (1) Identifying structurally sparse sub-network initializations for better performance; (2) Employing evolutionary search to find high-quality sub-networks; (3) Incorporating teacher-student knowledge distillation to enhance training efficiency and generalization.

Result: The proposed framework achieves the same validation perplexity as comparable SLMs while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining tokens, indicating significant efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and scalable solution for pretraining small language models, achieving performance comparable to larger models with reduced computational demands and making the approach reproducible and accessible through open resources.

Abstract: Small Language models (SLMs) offer an efficient and accessible alternative to
Large Language Models (LLMs), delivering strong performance while using far
fewer resources. We introduce a simple and effective framework for pretraining
SLMs that brings together three complementary ideas. First, we identify
structurally sparse sub-network initializations that consistently outperform
randomly initialized models of similar size under the same compute budget.
Second, we use evolutionary search to automatically discover high-quality
sub-network initializations, providing better starting points for pretraining.
Third, we apply knowledge distillation from larger teacher models to speed up
training and improve generalization. Together, these components make SLM
pretraining substantially more efficient: our best model, discovered using
evolutionary search and initialized with LLM weights, matches the validation
perplexity of a comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining
tokens. We release all code and models at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate personalized, step-wise user behavior in online environments by optimizing for persona-based rationale and action generation using reinforcement learning, outperforming generic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods primarily simulate generic, population-level policies without accounting for individual user personas, limiting their effectiveness in personalized applications.

Method: Customer-R1 employs reinforcement learning to condition LLM-generated policies on explicit user personas, optimizing next-step rationale and actions using correctness reward signals.

Result: Experiments on the OPeRA dataset show Customer-R1 significantly improves next-action prediction and better matches user action distributions compared to non-personalized methods.

Conclusion: Customer-R1 enhances the fidelity of personalized behavior simulations by integrating persona-based conditioning into LLM-based step-wise modeling, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has
become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various
practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in
modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy
without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than
personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can
LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce
Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior
simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an
explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via
action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate
that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based
baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users'
action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior
simulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating causal reasoning in LLMs using rigorous methods from top-tier economics and finance journals. Results highlight significant performance gaps in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks for assessing the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs, which rely on synthetic data and lack domain diversity.

Method: The benchmark uses 40,379 evaluation items derived from top economics and finance journals, employing methods like instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs to ensure rigor.

Result: Eight state-of-the-art LLMs were tested, with the best model scoring only 57.6% accuracy. Larger models did not consistently perform better, and even models designed for advanced reasoning struggled with basic causal tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show significant shortcomings in causal reasoning, highlighting the need for further advancements to meet the demands of high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching.
Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on
synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark
constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier
economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including
instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity
designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task
types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture.
Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial
limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover,
model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even
advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship
identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM
capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAD-RAG is introduced to enhance question answering over visually rich documents by addressing limitations of conventional methods in retrieving and reasoning over multi-page document dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional retrieval-augmented generation methods struggle with capturing document layout structures and dependencies across multiple pages, leading to incomplete evidence retrieval and poor answer quality.

Method: LAD-RAG utilizes a symbolic document graph to represent layout structures and cross-page dependencies, combined with neural embeddings. An LLM agent adaptively retrieves evidence during inference based on query demands.

Result: Experiments show LAD-RAG achieves over 90% perfect recall without top-k tuning, improves retrieval recall by up to 20% compared to baselines, and provides higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.

Conclusion: LAD-RAG effectively enhances multi-page document reasoning and evidence retrieval, addressing shortcomings of existing methods in visually rich document question answering.

Abstract: Question answering over visually rich documents (VRDs) requires reasoning not
only over isolated content but also over documents' structural organization and
cross-page dependencies. However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing
structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at
inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This
often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for
multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a
novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs
a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page
dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more
holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent
dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively
retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on
MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG
improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any
top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at
comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.

Motivation: The paper was motivated by the concern that widely used evaluation benchmarks for LLM factuality are static and outdated, potentially leading to unreliable assessments due to evolving real-world facts and the rapid advancement of LLMs.

Method: The authors systematically examined five widely-used factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs spanning different years. They devised an up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three new metrics to quantify the extent of benchmark aging and its effects on LLM factuality evaluations.

Result: The analysis revealed that a significant portion of popular factuality benchmarks are outdated, causing unreliable evaluation of LLM factuality.

Conclusion: Outdated benchmarks compromise the reliability of LLM factuality evaluations. The study emphasizes the need for updated benchmarks and hopes to inspire further research into this issue.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and the real world has
outpaced the static nature of widely used evaluation benchmarks, raising
concerns about their reliability for evaluating LLM factuality. While
substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their
temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects
on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we
present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular
factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An
up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify
benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental
results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the
widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable
assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess
the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more
research on the benchmark aging issue. Codes are available in

*Christos Ziakas,Nicholas Loo,Nishita Jain,Alessandra Russo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Red-Bandit introduces an adaptive red-teaming framework that dynamically exploits vulnerabilities in Large Language Models during inference, achieving high performance in generating unsafe prompts and revealing model-specific weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve upon existing red-teaming methods by creating a system that adapts dynamically to model vulnerabilities during inference and identifies unsafe behaviors effectively.

Method: Red-Bandit combines post-training of LoRA experts specialized in distinct attack styles using reinforcement learning and employs a multi-armed bandit policy to select attack styles in real-time based on the target model's responses.

Result: Red-Bandit demonstrates state-of-the-art efficacy in producing unsafe prompts (ASR@10) on AdvBench while maintaining better human readability with lower perplexity metrics.

Conclusion: This adaptive framework not only enhances auditing capabilities for LLMs but serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying vulnerabilities specific to distinct attack styles.

Abstract: Automated red-teaming has emerged as a scalable approach for auditing Large
Language Models (LLMs) prior to deployment, yet existing approaches lack
mechanisms to efficiently adapt to model-specific vulnerabilities at inference.
We introduce Red-Bandit, a red-teaming framework that adapts online to identify
and exploit model failure modes under distinct attack styles (e.g.,
manipulation, slang). Red-Bandit post-trains a set of parameter-efficient LoRA
experts, each specialized for a particular attack style, using reinforcement
learning that rewards the generation of unsafe prompts via a rule-based safety
model. At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among
these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety,
balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art
results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more
human-readable prompts (lower perplexity). Moreover, Red-Bandit's bandit policy
serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities by
indicating which attack styles most effectively elicit unsafe behaviors.

*Leitian Tao,Ilia Kulikov,Swarnadeep Saha,Tianlu Wang,Jing Xu,Yixuan Li,Jason E Weston,Ping Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents HERO, a reinforcement learning framework that combines deterministic verifier signals and continuous reward-model scores for improving reasoning in LLMs, achieving superior results on diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of binary feedback from verifiers in reasoning tasks, which fail to credit partial or alternative correct answers, and to exploit the richness of reward-model feedback to enhance learning.

Method: The authors propose HERO, which integrates verifier signals and reward-model scores. HERO employs stratified normalization for bounding reward scores and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging tasks, balancing correctness with nuanced quality feedback.

Result: HERO consistently outperforms both reward-model-only and verifier-only baselines across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating strong improvements in verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks.

Conclusion: Hybrid reward design, as implemented in HERO, combines the reliability of verifiers with the granular and nuanced feedback of reward models, advancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly
relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1
correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many
tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers
under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning.
Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a
complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid
Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO
employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within
verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality
distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts
where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines,
with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show
that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging
the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new, reference-free evaluation method for legal domain LLMs by breaking down responses into "Legal Data Points," which better aligns with human expert assessments and improves reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in evaluating LLM outputs in the legal domain, as existing methods rely on costly reference data or standardized assessments that lack reliability and alignment with legal professionals' needs.

Method: The authors propose breaking responses into 'Legal Data Points' (LDPs) and creating a reference-free evaluation framework that mirrors legal professionals' evaluation processes.

Result: The method outperforms baseline models on proprietary and open-source datasets, aligns more closely with expert human evaluations, and improves inter-annotator agreement.

Conclusion: The new method provides a more reliable and human-aligned means of evaluating LLM outputs in the legal domain, and the authors open-sourced part of their Legal Data Points to foster community replication and further research.

Abstract: Evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs in the legal domain presents
unique challenges due to the complex and nuanced nature of legal analysis.
Current evaluation approaches either depend on reference data, which is costly
to produce, or use standardized assessment methods, both of which have
significant limitations for legal applications.
  Although LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising evaluation technique, its
reliability and effectiveness in legal contexts depend heavily on evaluation
processes unique to the legal industry and how trustworthy the evaluation
appears to the human legal expert. This is where existing evaluation methods
currently fail and exhibit considerable variability.
  This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into
'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce
a novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers
evaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety
of baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset
(LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human
expert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d)
we open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our
experiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and
advance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal
question-answering.

### [136] [Don't Adapt Small Language Models for Tools; Adapt Tool Schemas to the Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07248)
*Jonggeun Lee,Woojung Song,Jongwook Han,Haesung Pyun,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called PA-Tool, which adapts tool schemas to match the knowledge of small language models (SLMs) to reduce errors and enhance performance in tool use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observed that small language models struggle with tool-use tasks due to schema misalignment, where models hallucinate non-existent tool names. They aim to address this challenge to enhance the utility of resource-efficient models.

Method: PA-Tool generates pretraining-aligned tool schemas by leveraging peakedness, a signal related to pretraining familiarity. It renames tool components without retraining, identifying naming patterns that align with the models.

Result: Using PA-Tool, schema misalignment errors were reduced by 80%, and improvements of up to 17% points were seen in tool-use tasks in MetaTool and RoTBench.

Conclusion: Adapting schemas to fit model knowledge, rather than forcing models to adapt, can enhance the tool-use potential of small language models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer significant computational advantages for
tool-augmented AI systems, yet they struggle with tool-use tasks, particularly
in selecting appropriate tools and identifying correct parameters. A common
failure mode is schema misalignment: models hallucinate plausible but
non-existent tool names that reflect naming conventions internalized during
pretraining but absent from the provided tool schema. Rather than forcing
models to adapt to arbitrary schemas, we propose adapting schemas to align with
models' pretrained knowledge. We introduce PA-Tool (Pretraining-Aligned Tool
Schema Generation), a training-free method that leverages peakedness-a signal
from contamination detection indicating pretraining familiarity-to
automatically rename tool components. By generating multiple candidates and
selecting those with highest output concentration across samples, PA-Tool
identifies pretrain-aligned naming patterns. Experiments on MetaTool and
RoTBench show improvements of up to 17% points, with schema misalignment errors
reduced by 80%. PA-Tool enables small models to approach state-of-the-art
performance while maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to new
tools without retraining. Our work demonstrates that schema-level interventions
can unlock the tool-use potential of resource-efficient models by adapting
schemas to models rather than models to schemas.

### [137] [Online Rubrics Elicitation from Pairwise Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07284)
*MohammadHossein Rezaei,Robert Vacareanu,Zihao Wang,Clinton Wang,Yunzhong He,Afra Feyza Akyürek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'OnlineRubrics,' a dynamic method for LLM training using rubrics that evolve during training to avoid static limitations and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static rubrics for training LLMs often fail to capture emergent errors during training and are susceptible to reward-hacking, limiting the improvement of LLMs’ open-ended responses.

Method: The paper proposes Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics) where evaluation criteria are dynamically curated via pairwise comparisons of responses from current and reference policies during training.

Result: Using OnlineRubrics improves LLM performance by up to 8% compared to static rubrics, evaluated across multiple benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, GPQA, and ArenaHard.

Conclusion: Dynamic rubrics effectively enhance LLM training, capturing emergent desiderata, addressing reward-hacking, and emphasizing themes like transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

Abstract: Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers
where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide
coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based
rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing
approaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such
static rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and
fail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce
Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates
evaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of
responses from current and reference policies. This online process enables
continuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds.
Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over
training exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as
well as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively
analyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as
transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

*Guangliang Liu,Haitao Mao,Bochuan Cao,Zhiyu Xue,Xitong Zhang,Rongrong Wang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores intrinsic self-correction in LLMs, particularly in moral contexts, highlighting performance improvement through multi-round interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how intrinsic self-correction works in LLMs, specifically moral corrections, and uncovering its mechanisms.

Method: Experimental analysis of performance convergence in LLMs during repeated rounds of self-correction.

Result: Findings show that moral concepts stabilize over successive self-correction rounds, reducing model uncertainty and enhancing performance.

Conclusion: Moral self-correction in LLMs has significant potential, as it enables reliable performance improvement through activating and stabilizing specific concepts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when
instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions
provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about
potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to
improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction.
The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various
applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on
moral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic
self-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and
provide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our
experimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of
convergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral
concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the
activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper
demonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it
exhibits a desirable property of converged performance.

*Xue Zhang,Yunlong Liang,Fandong Meng,Songming Zhang,Kaiyu Huang,Yufeng Chen,Jinan Xu,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-Thinker to improve reasoning model performance for non-English languages by addressing language consistency and reasoning path transfer issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models underperform in non-English contexts, affecting global usability and user experience.

Method: M-Thinker trains using the GRPO algorithm, incorporating Language Consistency (LC) and Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) rewards.

Result: M-Thinker models achieve almost perfect language consistency and excel on multilingual benchmarks, showcasing robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: M-Thinker enhances reasoning model functionality globally, overcoming language barriers and improving accuracy for non-English users.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances
both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical
limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to
maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly
with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These
limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers
and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we
propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a
Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment
(CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the
language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA
reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English
reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to
non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B
models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior
performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also
exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents CORGI, a new text-to-SQL benchmark tailored for complex business queries, and highlights the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in addressing real-world business intelligence challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL systems in business contexts often face limitations as existing benchmarks focus on simple factual queries, neglecting the complexity of real-world decision-making scenarios requiring causal reasoning and prediction.

Method: The authors created CORGI, a benchmark with synthetic databases inspired by real enterprises, and designed queries across four categories: descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and recommendational. They evaluated LLMs on this benchmark and compared results with simpler benchmarks like BIRD.

Result: The study found that LLMs perform poorly on advanced queries requiring prediction and actionable recommendations. CORGI is 21% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark, based on execution success rate.

Conclusion: There is a significant performance gap between popular LLMs and the requirements of business intelligence tasks. CORGI demonstrates the need for more advanced AI systems tailored for various levels of complex reasoning in business environments.

Abstract: In the business domain, where data-driven decision making is crucial,
text-to-SQL is fundamental for easy natural language access to structured data.
While recent LLMs have achieved strong performance in code generation, existing
text-to-SQL benchmarks remain focused on factual retrieval of past records. We
introduce CORGI, a new benchmark specifically designed for real-world business
contexts. CORGI is composed of synthetic databases inspired by enterprises such
as Doordash, Airbnb, and Lululemon. It provides questions across four
increasingly complex categories of business queries: descriptive, explanatory,
predictive, and recommendational. This challenge calls for causal reasoning,
temporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level and
multi-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops on
high-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer
actionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about
21\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap between
popular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence. We release a
public dataset and evaluation framework, and a website for public submissions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) to balance the trade-off between efficient memory and accurate long-sequence modeling, achieving superior results while reducing computational and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off in long-sequence modeling between efficiency (fixed-size memory in RNNs) and fidelity (lossless growing memory in Transformers).

Method: Introduce a hybrid memory system where a sliding KV cache serves as short-term memory and the Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) compresses older information into fixed-size long-term memory using RNN-like architectures.

Result: AHN-augmented models outperform sliding window baselines while matching or surpassing the performance of full-attention models, demonstrating significant reductions in computational and memory requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed memory framework provides an effective solution for long-sequence modeling, offering improved efficiency and accuracy, validated by experiments on long-context benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency
of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of
lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the
Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of
artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the
Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module
termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses
out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To
validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like
architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive
experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate
that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and
achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while
substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,
augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%
and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k
sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in railway automation's computer vision by proposing context-specific datasets and milestone determination for effective training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Railway automation faces challenges due to the lack of high-quality, sequential datasets, which affects real-time decision-making in computer vision systems.

Method: Focus on route-specific, contextually relevant cues to generate sequential datasets and use milestone determination to simplify training through rule-based models.

Result: Proposed an approach that eliminates the need for generalized dynamic recognition, emphasizing critical route decision points for effective vision agent training.

Conclusion: This methodology enhances the practicality, safety, and efficiency of machine learning systems in controlled railway environments.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the shortcomings of LLMs in generating emotionally compelling movie scripts and introduces a dataset and benchmarking system to elevate screenplay quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in structured text generation but struggle with storytelling and emotional depth required for movie scripts.

Method: The CML-Dataset, CML-Bench, and CML-Instruction were developed to evaluate and enhance screenplay generation by LLMs.

Result: CML-Bench offers reliable metrics for screenplay quality, and CML-Instruction guides LLMs to produce better screenplays that align with human preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed tools and methods improve screenplay quality generated by LLMs, overcoming key limitations and aligning outputs more closely with human standards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UVSD, a spammer detection model based on converting user behavior into video-like frames for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve spammer detection by leveraging video classification techniques to model user behavior as videos, addressing challenges posed by adversarial user stances.

Method: The UVSD model proposes three key steps: 1) user2pixel algorithm for quantifying stances as RGB pixels, 2) behavior2image algorithm to transform user behavior into frame images, and 3) constructing videos from frame images based on temporal features, followed by video classification for spam detection.

Result: Experiments on public datasets (WEIBO and TWITTER) show that UVSD outperforms existing spam detection methods.

Conclusion: The UVSD model demonstrates its effectiveness by innovatively combining user behavior videoization and video classification techniques for improved spammer detection.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study applies Monte Carlo Dropout in a ResNet-50 architecture to enhance surface landmine and UXO detection by quantifying prediction uncertainty, improving reliability under noise and adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural networks for landmine detection are prone to errors under noisy conditions and adversarial attacks, necessitating more robust methods.

Method: Monte Carlo Dropout was integrated into ResNet-50 to quantify uncertainty while detecting landmines and UXOs, and the model was tested on a simulated dataset.

Result: The model effectively flagged unreliable predictions under noise and adversarial attacks, demonstrating improved reliability and robustness.

Conclusion: Quantifying uncertainty in demining tasks increases prediction reliability and highlights the need for robust neural networks in practical, high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a tool called multimodars for integrating intravascular imaging and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) to achieve reliable 3D coronary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open and flexible tools that enable multi-state coronary analysis while ensuring deterministic behavior, performance, and ease of integration.

Method: Proposed multimodars, a tool using deterministic alignment algorithms, a NumPy data model, and an optimized Rust backend for scalable and reproducible research.

Result: Demonstrated a system that accepts diverse data inputs and integrates complementary imaging modalities effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed tool fills a critical gap, enabling efficient and reproducible 3D coronary analysis from multimodal imaging data.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can effectively understand and predict physical dynamics, an area unexplored despite VLMs excelling in visual perception and reasoning.

Method: The authors benchmarked six frontier VLMs using three datasets (CLEVRER, Physion, Physion++) and further designed diagnostic subtests to separate perception skills from physics reasoning.

Result: The analysis revealed a weak correlation between models' perceptual strengths and their physics reasoning capabilities, showing a fragmented understanding of causal dynamics.

Conclusion: Current Vision-Language Models fail to unify perceptual and physics reasoning into a coherent causal understanding, calling for improved architectures that bind these capabilities more effectively.

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [148] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced self-distillation framework to improve Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) training efficiency and performance, addressing computational challenges and leveraging selective self-generated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) faces challenges such as poor performance compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and significant computational burdens from traditional methods like surrogate gradients and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).

Method: The paper proposes a self-distillation framework where intermediate layer firing rates in SNNs are projected into lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Reliable knowledge is extracted and used to optimize SNN substructures while discarding unreliable components.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet show that the proposed method achieves higher performance in SNN training with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: The enhanced self-distillation framework successfully addresses the training inefficiency issues of SNNs, offering a scalable and effective solution for high-performance training under limited computational resources.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified AI system combining diverse CNN architectures and embedded large language models to improve dermatological diagnostics and patient education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dermatological diagnostic methods suffer from variability and limited accessibility, while existing AI solutions are hindered by biases and fragmented approaches.

Method: The framework integrates heterogeneous convolutional neural networks for improved diagnosis and embeds large language models for generating patient-centered educational reports.

Result: The system enhances diagnostic reliability, provides actionable reports for patients, and bridges gaps in communication between providers and patients.

Conclusion: This AI system advances dermatological care by improving diagnostic accuracy and patient education, promoting better early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [150] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the use of a pre-trained Vision Transformer to classify LIGO noise glitches into 24 categories with a 92.26% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the detection of gravitational waves by effectively categorizing transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data, especially with the addition of new noise classes in the O3a run.

Method: Using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32), the model was fine-tuned on a dataset combining Gravity Spy's data and new noise categories.

Result: The ViT model achieved a 92.26% classification efficiency for identifying 24 noise classes in LIGO's O3a dataset.

Conclusion: The Vision Transformer effectively distinguishes noise glitches, enhancing the accuracy of gravitational wave detection.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a masking-based goal representation approach for GCRL, achieving efficient learning and strong generalization in robotic tasks, including sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome limitations of existing goal representations in GCRL, which may struggle with generalization, slow convergence, or dependency on special equipment.

Method: The approach uses object-agnostic visual masks for goal representation, enabling dense reward generation without distance calculations. It incorporates learning from ground truth masks and employs open vocabulary object detection models for real-world applications.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen objects in simulation, and demonstrated effective pick-up task performance and sim-to-real transfer on physical robots.

Conclusion: Mask-based goal representation offers robust, efficient, and generalizable solutions for GCRL tasks, with promising real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [152] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GAN-based super-resolution model to enhance the spatial resolution of full-disk Hα images, enabling the resolution of fine-scale solar features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spatial resolution of full-disk Hα images is limited, making it inadequate for observing detailed solar structures like filaments and fibrils.

Method: The authors used Real-ESRGAN with specialized dense blocks and a relativistic discriminator. They aligned low-resolution GONG images with high-resolution GST images to train the model.

Result: The model recovers fine-scale solar details effectively, achieving an MSE of 467.15, RMSE of 21.59, and CC of 0.7794. Some quantitative limitations exist due to slight misalignments in the dataset.

Conclusion: The GAN-based approach demonstrates promise for solar image enhancement, though challenges like dataset misalignment need further work.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

*Jan Fiszer,Dominika Ciupek,Maciej Malawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores federated learning's (FL) effectiveness on brain tumor segmentation under non-IID data conditions caused by varying MRI intensity normalization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in medical imaging DL models such as data privacy, storage, and transfer while examining FL's capabilities with heterogeneous data.

Method: Simulated non-IID MRI conditions through different intensity normalization techniques applied to data subsets, followed by FL model training and evaluation.

Result: FL methods achieved a 3D Dice score of 92%, comparable to centralized models, demonstrating resilience to heterogeneous client data normalization.

Conclusion: Federated learning is a promising approach for privacy-preserving, high-performing medical DL applications even with inconsistent data normalization.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ is a training-free method aimed at reducing relational hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by leveraging textual and visual memories for better relational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of relational hallucinations in LVLMs, which are prevalent but underexplored.

Method: ChainMPQ uses subject-object keyword extraction and constructs multi-perspective questions focused on subjects, objects, and their relationships. These questions are input sequentially into the model, forming an interleaved chain that utilizes both text and image memories to guide reasoning.

Result: Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show significant reductions in relational hallucinations. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components.

Conclusion: ChainMPQ improves the reliability of LVLMs in relational inference tasks through a structured, memory-guided, and training-free approach.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

*Young D. Kwon,Abhinav Mehrotra,Malcolm Chadwick,Alberto Gil Ramos,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso is a high-resolution image editing system optimized for mobile devices. It achieves better image quality with reduced hallucinations and faster performance than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of diffusion-based image editing models on resource-constrained mobile devices, focusing on reducing memory usage and improving image quality at high resolutions.

Method: MobilePicasso introduces a three-stage system: image editing with hallucination-aware loss, latent projection to avoid pixel space conversion, and adaptive context-preserving tiling for high-resolution upscaling.

Result: MobilePicasso improves image quality by 18-48%, reduces hallucinations by 14-51%, achieves up to a 55.8× speed-up, and operates with only a 9% memory increase compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: MobilePicasso is highly efficient for on-device image editing at 4K resolution, outperforming server-based GPU models in speed while maintaining high image quality and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores an AI-based RGBD gaze tracking system using Transformers and contributes a new dataset. It compares various model configurations and highlights performance differences with Transformer and Multilayer Perceptron approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the combination of RGBD input images and Transformer architecture for gaze tracking, as it hasn't been explored yet, along with addressing the limitations of existing datasets.

Method: Developing an AI gaze tracking system using RGBD images and a Transformer module for feature fusion. A new dataset is created, and model architectures are trained and evaluated on three datasets.

Result: Models without pre-trained GAN modules outperform Transformer-based models in error measurements. Replacing the Transformer module with MLP further reduces errors.

Conclusion: The Transformer module does not consistently enhance performance for gaze tracking in the tested scenarios. Alternative methods, such as MLP, may show better results.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable deep learning method for generating high-resolution global maps of forest structural complexity using GEDI and SAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve forest structural complexity mapping, addressing gaps caused by GEDI's sparse sampling and supporting biodiversity and ecosystem management.

Method: The authors use a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture trained on GEDI footprints fused with multimodal SAR data to produce global maps with calibrated uncertainty.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.82) with minimal parameters, making global mapping accessible and producing multi-temporal datasets spanning 2015-2022.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates continuous monitoring of forest dynamics, empowering biodiversity conservation and climate response efforts with scalable and efficient modeling tools.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

Result: Lumina-DiMOO surpasses existing open-source multimodal models in performance benchmarks.

Conclusion: The released code and model checkpoints aim to drive research advancements in multimodal and discrete diffusion modeling efforts.

Abstract: We introduce Lumina-DiMOO, an open-source foundational model for seamless

image inpainting, etc.), as well as image understanding. Lumina-DiMOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing existing

*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransFIRA, a framework for face image recognizability assessment that operates in embedding space without relying on external labels or intensive computations. It claims state-of-the-art accuracy in multiple challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition in unconstrained environments faces challenges like pose, illumination, and occlusion, with existing quality metrics often failing to align with the encoder's decision-making.

Method: The method uses a class-center similarity and angular separation approach, leveraging embedding space for recognizability assessment. It is lightweight, does not require annotations, and avoids reliance on external heuristics or backbone-specific training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C datasets, doubles recognizability correlation, and performs robustly in body recognition and across datasets.

Conclusion: TransFIRA establishes itself as an accurate, explainable, and versatile framework for recognizability assessment, advancing FIQA in multiple dimensions including accuracy and modality extensibility.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

TL;DR: The NYSDOT uses machine learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks and random forests, trained on camera images and weather data, to classify road conditions with an accuracy of 81.5% on unseen cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide automated support to the NYSDOT for evaluating road conditions, particularly during winter weather events, while reducing labor-intensive manual assessments.

Method: Convolutional neural networks and random forests were applied to ~22,000 hand-labeled camera images categorized into six road surface conditions. Training included weather data and prioritized model generalizability.

Result: The machine learning models achieved an accuracy of 81.5% on road surface condition classification, specifically for unseen cameras.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can effectively support critical operational decisions in road condition monitoring and improve efficiency in tasks traditionally performed manually.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

*Piyush Dashpute,Niki Nezakati,Wolfgang Heidrich,Vishwanath Saragadam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) to address issues like low resolution and noise in thermal images, delivering effective restoration for tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging suffers from issues such as low resolution, fixed pattern noise, localized degradations, and limited datasets. A new approach is needed to overcome these challenges effectively.

Method: The researchers developed TDiff, a patch-based framework that restores full-resolution thermal images by processing small patches, denoising them, and blending them using smooth spatial windowing.

Result: TDiff shows strong performance in restoring thermal images in tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring. The results were validated on both simulated and real thermal images.

Conclusion: The proposed TDiff framework offers a unified and effective restoration pipeline for thermal images, leveraging patch-based learning to address multiple challenges.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

TL;DR: SIGMA-GEN is a framework enabling multi-subject identity-preserved image generation with spatial and structural precision, supported by a novel dataset called SIGMA-SET27K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating images with multiple identities while preserving structural and spatial guidance in a single-pass process.

Method: Introduces SIGMA-GEN, a single model framework, and a synthetic dataset SIGMA-SET27K that provides identity, structure, and spatial data for image generation.

Result: SIGMA-GEN achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, quality of generated images, and efficiency.

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN demonstrates significant advancements in identity-preservation and flexible user control in image generation tasks, setting a new standard.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both
structural and spatial constraints. A key strength of our method is its ability
to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects
across 27k images. Through extensive evaluation we demonstrate that SIGMA-GEN
achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image
generation quality, and speed. Code and visualizations at

*Jack Roberts,Jeova Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIGRID, a superpixel-based data structure, which reduces dimensionality and boosts efficiency while maintaining or surpassing segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superpixels simplify image data for efficiency, but their irregularity has caused complications in deep learning applications.

Method: A new data structure called SIGRID integrates color and shape information using superpixels and classical shape descriptors, reducing input size for segmentation tasks.

Result: SIGRIDs provide comparable or improved segmentation performance versus pixel-level data while accelerating model training across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SIGRIDs effectively balance data compression, accuracy, and computational speed, making them a viable alternative for segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

*Qingxuan Wu,Zhiyang Dou,Chuan Guo,Yiming Huang,Qiao Feng,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Text2Interact, a framework for generating realistic and text-aligned human-human interactions by overcoming issues of limited training data and insufficient text-to-interaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with 1) limited interaction data for two-person scenarios and 2) poor fine-grained alignment between text and interactions, hindering realistic modeling.

Method: The authors propose a two-part system: (1) InterCompose, a data synthesis pipeline that uses LLMs, motion priors, and filtering to expand interaction data; and (2) InterActor, a model with word-level conditioning and adaptive loss for better spatiotemporal coupling of interactions.

Result: The framework improves motion diversity, fidelity, and interaction generalization as verified by experiments, including out-of-distribution scenarios and user studies.

Conclusion: Text2Interact offers a scalable, high-fidelity solution for generating text-consistent human interactions and demonstrates substantial improvements in realistic modeling; the code and models will be made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

*Shih-Yao Lin,Sibendu Paul,Caren Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents KeyScore, a framework that selects key video frames using multimodal signals, and introduces STACFP to improve frame selection in long-form videos, achieving high efficiency and performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding long videos efficiently by selecting a small yet semantically and contextually rich subset of frames for downstream tasks.

Method: KeyScore leverages multimodal (visual and textual) information to score and select important frames using semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact. It is complemented by STACFP for generating diverse and compact frame proposals.

Result: The framework reduces the frames by up to 99% compared to full-frame analysis and outperforms standard 8-frame encoders on tasks like video retrieval, captioning, and reasoning across datasets (MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo).

Conclusion: By aligning visual and textual signals, the proposed approach enables scalable and efficient video understanding without requiring explicit summarization techniques.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

### [166] [LogSTOP: Temporal Scores over Prediction Sequences for Matching and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06512)
*Avishree Khare,Hideki Okamoto,Bardh Hoxha,Georgios Fainekos,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogSTOP, a scoring function for assigning temporal property scores using noisy local predictors like YOLO and HuBERT, demonstrating superior performance in query matching and ranked retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to infer and score temporal properties over sequences, such as detecting object changes in videos or emotional transitions in audio, is crucial for improving downstream tasks like query matching and ranked retrieval. However, current approaches lack efficiency and robustness in leveraging scores for these temporal properties.

Method: The authors formalize the problem of assigning temporal property scores (STOPs) based on local predictors and propose LogSTOP, a scoring function optimized for temporal properties in Linear Temporal Logic. They benchmark its performance using models like YOLO, HuBERT, Grounding DINO, and SlowR50.

Result: LogSTOP shows at least a 16% improvement in query matching tasks over other temporal logic-based and language model baselines. For ranked retrieval tasks, it achieves up to a 19% increase in mean average precision and recall compared to zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: LogSTOP provides an efficient and accurate approach to compute scores for temporal properties, enhancing tasks like query matching and retrieval in video and audio processing domains.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

TL;DR: TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based framework for limited-angle electron tomography, addresses missing-wedge artifacts using FIB-SEM training data without requiring clean TEM ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the missing-wedge problem in limited-angle electron tomography and the challenge of acquiring large high-quality training datasets with known TEM ground truth.

Method: TEMDiff uses FIB-SEM data as training input, simulating them into TEM tilt series and employing a diffusion-based 3D iterative framework, ensuring slice consistency without extra regularization.

Result: TEMDiff outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, effectively recovering accurate 3D structures even under narrow tilt ranges (8 degrees with 2-degree increments).

Conclusion: TEMDiff generalizes well to real-world TEM data and demonstrates robust reconstruction capabilities without retraining or fine-tuning, setting a new benchmark for limited-angle electron tomography.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VUGEN uses Vision-Language Models for efficient, high-quality image generation by aligning visual understanding with reduced latent spaces for sampling and pixel decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robust image generation capabilities in Vision-Language Models while addressing misalignment issues and architectural complexities of existing solutions.

Method: Transforms VLM latent space into a tractable distribution, aligns sampling within this space, and utilizes a pixel diffusion decoder for image generation.

Result: VUGEN improves image generation performance, enhancing metrics like DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO.

Conclusion: VUGEN achieves efficient and superior image generation while preserving the original understanding capabilities of Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a post-hoc interpretability method called cluster paths, enabling concise and human-readable explanations for neural network decisions across tasks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of deep neural networks’ decision processes, which risks unwarranted trust, hidden biases, and unexpected failures.

Method: The cluster paths method clusters neural activations at selected layers to represent inputs as sequences of cluster IDs. It employs four metrics to evaluate paths and is extended to large models with concept paths.

Result: Cluster paths unveil color-based shortcuts in spurious-cue tasks, maintain high faithfulness and agreement under noise, generalize to Vision Transformers, and act as OOD detectors.

Conclusion: Cluster paths effectively expose visual concepts and shortcuts, enhance model interpretability, scale to large models, and support reliable decision-making with concise explanations.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based approach for image super-resolution that improves computational efficiency by using subgraph decomposition and selective feature retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and attention-based methods lack flexibility, while graph-based methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed HSNet decomposes a global graph into subgraphs using CSSB, integrates their features via SAB, and employs NSS for selective feature retention.

Result: HSNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image super-resolution, balancing quality with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HSNet effectively mitigates limitations of structural inflexibility and computational expense in super-resolution, offering a novel graph-based solution.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

*Fei Zhang,Rob Chancia,Josie Clapp,Amirhossein Hassanzadeh,Dimah Dera,Richard MacKenzie,Jan van Aardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a semi-automated pipeline for semantic segmentation of TLS point clouds, reducing manual annotation effort while maintaining high accuracy. It builds the Mangrove3D dataset and evaluates data efficiency and feature importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of TLS point clouds is crucial, but manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming, motivating the need for an efficient, semi-automated solution.

Method: A pipeline combines spherical projection, feature enrichment, ensemble learning, and uncertainty-guided annotation. It also utilizes visualization tools and a cross-dataset evaluation strategy.

Result: The pipeline achieves high segmentation accuracy with a mean IoU of ~0.76 after labeling 12 scans. Results find geometric features play a key role, and a nine-channel feature stack captures most discriminative power.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable, high-quality segmentation for TLS point clouds, validated by both a new dataset (Mangrove3D) and cross-dataset generalization testing. The contributions enhance ecological monitoring and similar fields.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between accuracy and speed in LiDAR semantic segmentation methods, especially for real-time performance on embedded systems.

Method: Proposed a novel pre-processing methodology to reduce computational overhead, introduced Conv-SE-NeXt blocks for efficient representation capture, and utilized a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone.

Result: Achieved superior speed-accuracy trade-off on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks; proved comparable to top-ranked methods (like PTv3) while running 24 times faster.

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt effectively balances speed and accuracy in LiDAR semantic segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with significant real-time processing advantages on embedded systems.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores domain adaptation, specifically through domain adversarial neural networks (DANN), to address distribution shifts caused by new image artifacts in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT imaging artifacts can severely compromise model performance. Labeling data to address these artifacts is costly, so the researchers aim to evaluate if domain adaptation can improve robustness without requiring labeled images.

Method: The study introduces simulated ring artifacts in CT images and compares DANN models against baseline models and augmentation-based methods using the OrganAMNIST dataset.

Result: Baseline models failed to generalize to artifact images, and augmentation was ineffective. DANN maintained high classification accuracy, performing comparably to models trained with labeled artifact images and even generalized to uniform noise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation via DANN is a promising approach to addressing distribution shifts in medical imaging, reducing the need for costly labeling of new artifact images for clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

TL;DR: MingTok introduces continuous latent space visual tokenizers to unify visual understanding and generation, addressing shortcomings of discrete tokenization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenization methods face limitations due to quantization errors in discrete representations, hindering semantic expressiveness and performance in vision-language tasks.

Method: MingTok employs a three-stage architecture for tokenization—low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction—and integrates understanding and generation tasks under a shared autoregressive prediction paradigm.

Result: MingTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual understanding and generation tasks through unified continuous visual representations.

Conclusion: Unifying visual tokenization in continuous latent space benefits diverse vision-language tasks, paving the way for advanced autoregressive models. Code and model are released to support further research.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

Motivation: Current deep learning methods for digital pathology are hindered by domain shifts due to color inconsistencies stemming from variations in staining techniques and imaging conditions.

Method: The authors propose a physics-inspired, trainable model for color normalization utilizing the Beer-Lambert law and an unrolled nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) architecture, integrating it with backbone networks for downstream tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method on public pathology datasets and internally curated malaria blood smears for object detection and classification compared to state-of-the-art color normalization approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses color variability issues in pathology images, enhancing model robustness for cross-domain deep learning applications in digital pathology.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) for assessing synthetic data quality in object detection tasks, demonstrating a strong correlation with mean Average Precision (mAP) while minimizing costly iterative training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the scarcity of well-annotated training datasets for machine learning models, leveraging synthetic data for improved model performance necessitated an effective evaluation metric.

Method: The SDQM evaluates the quality of synthetic datasets used in object detection tasks without requiring full model training convergence.

Result: SDQM showed strong correlation with mAP scores of YOLOv11, outperforming previous metrics that had only moderate or weak correlations, while providing actionable feedback for dataset optimization.

Conclusion: SDQM offers a scalable and efficient way to evaluate synthetic dataset quality, significantly aiding resource-constrained object detection tasks.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

*Jingran Xu,Yuanyuan Liu,Yanjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UnrollINR, a zero-shot self-supervised framework for accelerating MRI reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance at high scan acceleration rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI scans are limited by long acquisition times, and high-quality reconstruction from undersampled data can minimize this limitation. Fully sampled data is often unavailable, motivating self-supervised and unsupervised approaches.

Method: The proposed method, UnrollINR, utilizes a physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction framework combined with an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as regularization, enabling scan-specific reconstruction without external training data.

Result: UnrollINR demonstrates superior MRI reconstruction performance even at a high acceleration rate of 10, outperforming supervised learning approaches.

Conclusion: UnrollINR enhances both interpretability and performance, providing an effective solution for faster and reliable MRI scans.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

### [179] [WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313)
*Zezhong Qian,Xiaowei Chi,Yuming Li,Shizun Wang,Zhiyuan Qin,Xiaozhu Ju,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces WristWorld, a novel model that generates wrist-view videos crucial for enhancing manipulation performance, bridging the gap in datasets lacking wrist-view recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale datasets lack wrist-view recordings essential for capturing fine-grained hand-object interactions, creating a gap between anchor views and wrist views.

Method: WristWorld operates in two stages: Reconstruction, utilizing VGGT and their Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss for geometric wrist-view estimation; and Generation, synthesizing wrist-view videos using a video generation model.

Result: Experiments on three datasets—Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda—show state-of-the-art video generation with improved spatial consistency and a 3.81% improvement in task completion length in a benchmark, bridging 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

Conclusion: WristWorld effectively bridges the anchor-wrist view gap, enhances video-generation fidelity, and significantly improves visual language action (VLA) task performance.

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MuEx, a novel framework for improving speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) to address issues like poor performance in non-English languages, using phonemes and visemes as intermediaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFS models underperform in non-English languages due to English-dominated datasets and lack of cross-language generalization abilities.

Method: The authors propose a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) framework, incorporating phoneme-viseme alignment (PV-Align) for robust cross-lingual synchronization. Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) is introduced for evaluation.

Result: The MuEx model outperforms all competing systems across multiple languages from MTFB, with strong zero-shot generalization to unseen languages.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses multilingual challenges in TFS, presenting a scalable and effective solution with implications for diverse, real-world applications.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of RGB-based visual object trackers in handling real-world complexities like occlusion, interference from similar objects, and complex backgrounds, by leveraging multispectral imagery.

Method: The authors created the MSITrack dataset, which includes 300 videos, over 129k frames of multispectral imagery, representing 55 object categories and 300 natural scenes. Each frame was annotated meticulously with manual labeling and multi-stage verification processes.

Result: The evaluations showed that using the MSITrack dataset significantly improved the performance of representative trackers compared to RGB-only baselines.

Conclusion: MSITrack enhances tracking capabilities by leveraging multispectral data and will likely play a key role in future advancements in the field. The dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

*Zhihao Wen,Wenkang Wei,Yuan Fang,Xingtong Yu,Hui Zhang,Weicheng Zhu,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces StaR-KVQA, a method for improving implicit knowledge-based visual question answering by supervising reasoning traces and enhancing interpretability and accuracy without external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the shortcomings of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in implicit-knowledge visual question answering tasks, specifically their poor reasoning abilities, inconsistent justifications, and generalization limitations after fine-tuning.

Method: StaR-KVQA supervises structured reasoning traces, including symbolic relation paths and path-grounded explanations. It constructs and selects traces to create a trace-enriched dataset and fine-tunes MLLMs via structured self-distillation. It avoids using external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases, building traces offline and using a single autoregressive inference pass.

Result: StaR-KVQA significantly improves both accuracy and interpretability in knowledge-based VQA tasks, achieving up to 11.3% higher accuracy on the OK-VQA benchmark compared to the strongest baseline, and demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Supervising structured reasoning traces enhances reasoning transparency and verifiability, leading to improvements in both the performance and interpretability of MLLMs in implicit-knowledge visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

TL;DR: The paper presents AutoNAD, an automated framework combining convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons for surface defect detection, addressing challenges of intraclass difference and interclass similarity in an efficient manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance industrial surface defect detection (SDD), which struggles with intraclass difference and interclass similarity using traditional manually designed models.

Method: AutoNAD is an automated neural architecture design framework that employs cross weight sharing strategy and a multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) to optimize efficiency and performance, while integrating latency-aware priors for runtime efficiency.

Result: AutoNAD demonstrates effectiveness on three industrial defect datasets, showcasing improved detection accuracy, efficient training, and suitability for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: AutoNAD addresses key challenges in SDD with robust automated design, suitable for industrial applications, improving both model accuracy and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Motivation: To create a principled approach that extends language modeling principles to image generation by improving upon limitations of causal autoregressive models.

Method: The method involves predicting the 2D spatial distribution over images sequentially using a causal Transformer with a reconstruction-oriented visual tokenizer.

Result: Heptapod achieved a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.70 on the ImageNet generation benchmark, outperforming prior causal autoregressive approaches.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the relevance of unifying sequential autoregression with self-supervised learning to effectively model image semantics, potentially inspiring innovations in visual and multimodal generative models.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DreamOmni2, a new approach for multimodal instruction-based editing and generation that integrates text and image instructions to handle abstract and concrete concepts, with corresponding benchmarks and promising experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in instruction-based editing, which requires reference images for detailed editing, and subject-driven generation, which struggles to manage abstract concepts.

Method: The approach involves creating synthetic data for training through feature mixing, using generative models for editing/extraction, and implementing a novel model framework with index and position encoding and joint training with a Vision-Language Model (VLM).

Result: DreamOmni2 demonstrated impressive outcomes in multimodal editing and generation tasks through enhanced processing of complex instructions with both abstract and concrete elements.

Conclusion: DreamOmni2 effectively addresses existing challenges in image editing and generation, pushing forward practical applications and providing benchmarks to guide future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset and a method for multimodal semantic segmentation by combining light field images with LiDAR point clouds, addressing challenges such as occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation in autonomous driving faces challenges like occlusion and the need for robust perception in complex conditions. Traditional methods struggle due to limited viewpoint diversity and modality discrepancies.

Method: A multi-modal segmentation network (Mlpfseg) is proposed, which integrates feature completion to align image and point cloud densities and depth perception to improve attention scores for occlusion handling.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance with a 1.71 mIoU improvement over image-only methods and a 2.38 mIoU improvement over point cloud-only methods.

Conclusion: Combining light field data and point cloud data for semantic segmentation effectively enhances accuracy and robustness, addressing challenges like occlusion and modality differences.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of tracking and novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes by leveraging structural deformation patterns.

Method: SCas4D uses a cascaded optimization approach, refining deformations hierarchically from part-level to point-level in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes.

Result: Achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame, matching results of existing methods with one-twentieth the training iterations. Demonstrates applications in segmentation, view synthesis, and point tracking tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is computationally efficient and achieves high performance across multiple tasks, leveraging hierarchical deformation patterns effectively.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of suitable evaluation metrics and frameworks to account for temporal biases and period-specific errors limits the efficiency of LLM-based OCR models in creating accurate historical corpora.

Method: The study introduces metrics such as Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), designs contamination control protocols, and applies them to test 12 multimodal LLMs using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts.

Result: The Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR systems but show excessive insertion of characters from incorrect historical periods, undermining their historical accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework and metrics aim to enhance LLM-based historical OCR model selection and quality assessment, offering guidelines for digital humanities practitioners and highlighting challenges of over-historicization.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an
evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination
risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

*Zhiliang Zhu,Tao Zeng,Tao Yang,Guoliang Luo,Jiyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeRainMamba, a model combining frequency-domain awareness and spatial detail enhancement for efficient and effective image deraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based models for image deraining fail to capture fine-grained details and lack awareness in the frequency domain, limiting their performance.

Method: The proposed DeRainMamba integrates the Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) for Fourier-based rain removal and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) for local structure restoration through anisotropic gradient features.

Result: DeRainMamba showed superior performance in PSNR and SSIM metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods across four public benchmarks, with fewer parameters and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The integration of frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement in DeRainMamba successfully addresses shortcomings of existing models, offering efficient and improved image deraining capabilities.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

### [190] [OBS-Diff: Accurate Pruning For Diffusion Models in One-Shot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06751)
*Junhan Zhu,Hesong Wang,Mingluo Su,Zefang Wang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OBS-Diff, a one-shot pruning framework that efficiently compresses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models while ensuring high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, and existing pruning methods cannot be directly applied due to their iterative nature. This paper seeks to address this issue.

Method: OBS-Diff adapts the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) method for diffusion models, incorporates a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction, and introduces a group-wise sequential pruning strategy.

Result: OBS-Diff achieves inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality, setting a new standard for one-shot pruning in diffusion models.

Conclusion: OBS-Diff enables efficient and accurate compression of text-to-image diffusion models, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

### [191] [Transforming Noise Distributions with Histogram Matching: Towards a Single Denoiser for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06757)
*Sheng Fu,Junchao Zhang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generalize supervised Gaussian denoisers for various types of out-of-distribution noise through noise transformation and refined noise-to-noise cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the limited generalization ability of supervised Gaussian denoisers when encountering noise types that differ significantly from the training distribution.

Method: The authors introduce noise transformation techniques such as local histogram matching, intrapatch permutation, and frequency-domain histogram matching. These transformations refine the noise progressively and improve denoising performance.

Result: The method enables a single Gaussian denoiser to handle diverse synthetic and complex real-world noise types effectively and demonstrates superior generalization in experiments.

Conclusion: This approach significantly expands the applicability and effectiveness of Gaussian denoisers across various noise distributions, improving their practical usability.

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

### [192] [A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to train land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery and weak low-resolution labels, leveraging pooling layers and MIL concepts for better mapping results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by insufficient quantity and quality of training labels in high-resolution land-cover mapping tasks.

Method: The authors utilize Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL) and propose a flexible pooling mechanism coupled with Positive-Unlabeled Learning to train pixel-level classifiers while leveraging low-resolution reference labels.

Result: Testing on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrates the superiority of the method over conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances land-cover classification performance using weak low-resolution labels and high-resolution imagery, proving its effectiveness.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

### [193] [TTRV: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06783)
*Akshit Singh,Shyam Marjit,Wei Lin,Paul Gavrikov,Serena Yeung-Levy,Hilde Kuehne,Rogerio Feris,Sivan Doveh,James Glass,M. Jehanzeb Mirza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTRV enhances vision-language model inference using test-time reinforcement learning without labeled data, delivering impressive gains across various visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning systems rely heavily on labeled data, which differs from how humans learn dynamically and directly from their environment.

Method: TTRV improves the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework by leveraging test-time adaptation, incorporating reward signals from output frequency and entropy control to diversify and refine model predictions.

Result: The method achieves significant improvements in object recognition (up to 52.4%) and visual question answering (up to 29.8%), even surpassing GPT-4o on image recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: TTRV demonstrates the potential of test-time RL for vision-language models, offering strong results even under extreme data constraints.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

### [194] [Extreme Amodal Face Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06791)
*Changlin Song,Yunzhong Hou,Michael Randall Barnes,Rahul Shome,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a single-image solution for extreme amodal face detection using contextual cues rather than generative models or sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme amodal detection focuses on identifying object locations that are out-of-frame in an image, emphasizing safety and privacy applications, particularly for faces.

Method: The authors propose a heatmap-based detector with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder to efficiently predict out-of-frame regions using contextual image cues.

Result: The proposed approach achieves strong results and is more efficient than generative or sequence-based methods.

Conclusion: Their method demonstrates effectiveness in solving the extreme amodal detection problem, setting a benchmark for this task.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

*Teng Wang,Haojun Jiang,Yuxuan Wang,Zhenguo Sun,Shiji Song,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enhance ultrasound probe guidance for junior sonographers using pre-trained ultrasound foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shortage of highly skilled personnel in cardiac ultrasound hinders timely diagnosis, necessitating advanced tools to assist junior sonographers in acquiring high-quality images.

Method: The authors designed the VA-Adapter to incorporate vision-action sequential reasoning into pre-trained ultrasound foundation models, enabling real-time operational guidance through fine-tuning a minimal subset of parameters.

Result: The VA-Adapter significantly improves probe guidance performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models in experiments.

Conclusion: By integrating parameter-efficient enhancements, the VA-Adapter successfully adapts foundation models to assist sonographers, improving cardiac ultrasound image acquisition effectively.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

### [196] [Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoders for Large Scale Vision-Language Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06820)
*Mitchell Keren Taraday,Shahaf Wagner,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDJE is a new and efficient joint encoder for multimodal retrieval that precomputes and compresses visual features, achieving fast inference, high retrieval performance, and reduced storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing joint encoders for vision-language tasks due to their expensive visual feature extraction process, hindering large-scale deployment.

Method: Introducing EDJE, which precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them using a lightweight attention-based adapter, enabling a small joint encoder to process data efficiently during online inference.

Result: EDJE achieves high retrieval performance on tasks like Flickr and COCO retrieval while processing 50k image-text pairs per second and requiring minimal disk storage (49kB per image).

Conclusion: EDJE strikes a balance between efficiency and performance, making it suitable for scalable multimodal retrieval applications, and its implementation will be made open-source soon.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

*Jaeseok Jeong,Junho Kim,Gayoung Lee,Yunjey Choi,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to improve text-to-image generation models, tackling content leakage caused by visual style prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of content leakage in diffusion models where unintended elements from visual prompts are transferred to generated images.

Method: Extended classifier-free guidance (CFG) with swapping self-attention and proposed Negative Visual Query Guidance (NVQG). NVQG simulates content leakage scenarios and reduces unwanted content transfer.

Result: Achieved significant reduction of content leakage while retaining accurate style transfer and alignment between image generation and text prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve text-to-image generation accuracy and style fidelity, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code
is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

*Mikihiro Ikura,Arren Glover,Masayoshi Mizuno,Chiara Bartolozzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a real-time line segment detection and tracking pipeline using only high-resolution event-based cameras, demonstrating improved accuracy and fully stand-alone operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Line segment extraction from geometric features is essential in human-made environments, but event-based camera methods often rely on additional frame cameras or face limitations with high event rates.

Method: The method involves (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, and (iii) line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.

Result: The proposed pipeline achieves real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validated using both an ad-hoc dataset and public datasets.

Conclusion: This work enables fully stand-alone real-time operation of high-resolution event-based cameras in real-world environments.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

*Kanglei Zhou,Qingyi Pan,Xingxing Zhang,Hubert P. H. Shum,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual AQA (CAQA), merging Continual Learning (CL) with Action Quality Assessment (AQA), and proposes a method called MAGR++ to address challenges like catastrophic forgetting and overfitting in evolving action datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQA methods struggle with the non-stationary distributions in real-world scenarios, leading to limited generalization. This paper aims to enhance AQA with continual learning to handle evolving distributions and reduce catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The paper proposes MAGR++, a method combining full-parameter fine-tuning with Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization. MAGR++ includes a two-step feature rectification pipeline for translating and aligning feature representations.

Result: MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on four CAQA benchmarks with cross-dataset comparisons, showing average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online compared to the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning is crucial for representation learning but must be controlled to prevent overfitting. MAGR++ effectively addresses this balance, demonstrating robust performance and relieving challenges in evolving action quality datasets.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

TL;DR: Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD) is introduced as a new task to identify event boundaries in streaming videos in real-time, without access to future frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in Generic Event Boundary Detection rely on analyzing complete video frames, which limits real-time applications that align with human processing capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a novel framework called Estimator, comprising two components: Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA) that predicts future frames based on prior ones, and Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD) that uses prediction error and adaptive thresholds to detect event boundaries.

Result: The Estimator framework demonstrated superior performance compared to adapted online video understanding baselines and comparable results to offline methods on established datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed On-GEBD task and Estimator framework enable real-time event boundary detection in videos, mimicking human perception capabilities and paving the way for advanced video understanding applications.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility and effects of using raw, unprocessed sensor data for AI-based object detection and classification tasks onboard satellites, addressing a gap as most current solutions rely on preprocessed data.

Method: A simulation workflow was developed to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) were trained on raw and L1 datasets, and their performance was evaluated using detection metrics and explainability tools.

Result: Both models performed similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds; however, models trained on raw data struggled with high-confidence object boundary identification.

Conclusion: Adapting AI architectures with advanced contouring methods can improve object detection on raw images, advancing onboard AI capabilities for remote sensing.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of AI-based severity prediction for lung infections, addressing its crucial role in supporting clinical decisions, especially during pandemics.

Method: A Transformer-based architecture called QCross-Att-PVT that uses parallel encoders, cross-gated attention, and a feature aggregator, combined with a novel data augmentation strategy, Conditional Online TransMix.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art models in evaluating benchmark datasets for CT and chest X-rays, showcasing improved robustness and predictive performance.

Conclusion: The method enhances clinical tools for lung infection diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of data augmentation and gated attention mechanisms, and provides an adaptable framework that supports disease monitoring and treatment planning.

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel
method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung
infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image
patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and
Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data
augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive
accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical
diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning. The source

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel active learning-based approach for change detection in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images, focusing on minimizing the need for hand-labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for change detection in remote sensing require extensive hand-labeled training data, which is challenging due to varying acquisition conditions and user subjectivity.

Method: The proposed method uses an active learning algorithm that selects critical unlabeled samples, referred to as virtual exemplars, for labeling by an oracle. These exemplars are generated using an invertible graph convolutional network optimized with an adversarial loss, ensuring they are representative, diverse, and ambiguous.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the label efficiency and superior performance of the proposed method compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This work introduces a label-efficient active learning model that effectively reduces labeling effort and improves change detection results in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

Result: Experiments show IAR2 achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 1.50 on ImageNet, excelling in performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IAR2 significantly advances the field by improving generation quality, efficiency, and conditional alignment through its structured coarse-to-fine generation approach.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

### [205] [OBJVanish: Physically Realizable Text-to-3D Adv. Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06952)
*Bing Li,Wuqi Wang,Yanan Zhang,Jingzheng Li,Haigen Min,Wei Feng,Xingyu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel generation approach called Physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen), which creates LiDAR-invisible pedestrian 3D objects that evade detection systems, ensuring they are physically realizable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in LiDAR-based 3D object detectors, which are crucial for the safety of autonomous driving, by creating effective adversarial attacks.

Method: Developed Phy3DAdvGen that systematically optimizes text prompts to generate LiDAR-invisible 3D pedestrians, constrained by real-world 3D object combinations and tested in the CARLA simulation and physical environments.

Result: Phy3DAdvGen successfully evades six state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D detectors through extensive experiments in simulated and physical scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the vulnerabilities in LiDAR-based 3D detection systems, which demand thorough testing and optimization before deployment in autonomous applications.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

*Huanning Dong,Fan Li,Ping Kuang,Jianwen Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DirectGaussian, a method using surfels and Gaussian splatting with multi-view priors to create geometrically consistent and high-fidelity 3D objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating 3D content remains challenging due to complex geometry in natural objects, and existing methods either depend on 2D priors or work with specific 3D representations.

Method: DirectGaussian generates 3D object surfaces using surfels rendered by 2D Gaussian splatting and multi-view priors, with curvature constraints for geometric consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DirectGaussian produces diverse, high-quality 3D content, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian offers a novel approach to 3D modeling, overcoming multi-view consistency issues with curvature optimization and delivering high-fidelity surfaces.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

### [207] [Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06969)
*Shoumeng Qiu,Xinrun Li,Yang Long,Xiangyang Xue,Varun Ojha,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MapGR, a method for HD map construction in autonomous driving, emphasizing global representation learning and achieving improved mAP on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art methods for HD map construction rely on local query perspectives and lack utilization of global representations, which are essential for effective HD mapping.

Method: MapGR employs a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module for holistic query alignment with the global map and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module to provide contextual information for individual queries.

Result: The approach consistently improves mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MapGR demonstrates the importance of integrating global representations in HD map construction, setting a new standard for mAP performance.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

*Zhantao Yang,Huangji Wang,Ruili Feng,Han Zhang,Yuting Hu,Shangwen Zhu,Junyan Li,Yu Liu,Fan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called RICE to improve ID-Matching in long video captioning, showing significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ID-Matching problem in long video captioning, a crucial issue that involves recognizing the same individuals across different frames but has been underexplored.

Method: The authors leverage large vision-language models (LVLMs) and propose enhancements in using image information and detailed individual descriptions. They also establish a new benchmark for evaluating ID-Matching.

Result: RICE improves ID-Matching precision from 50% to 90% and recall from 15% to 80% on the GPT-4o model, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work showcases the potential of RICE in solving the ID-Matching issue, enabling more accurate and detailed video captions.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a post-training framework utilizing reinforcement learning to fine-tune pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, eliminating the need for motion ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of adapting diffusion models to unseen actions or styles without requiring costly motion capture data and complete model retraining.

Method: The authors employ Reinforcement Learning with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization and utilize a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal to fine-tune motion diffusion models.

Result: The method demonstrated improved quality and diversity in generated motions while retaining performance on the original distribution across various datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a flexible, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for adapting motion diffusion models to new domains without the need for paired motion data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning method integrating Hidden Markov Models with Transformer Encoders for classifying time series satellite images, improving temporal consistency in crop type predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling yearly land-cover map changes with temporal consistency, especially in crop type classification using satellite imagery.

Method: The method combines Transformer Encoder (TE)-based deep learning networks with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), with HMM serving as a cascading layer to enhance the temporal consistency of classifications in satellite image time series.

Result: Validation on a six-year dataset with 47 crop types shows improved performance and F1 scores using the combined approach, demonstrating its capability to handle temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of HMM with TE-based DNNs effectively captures both intricate temporal correlations and multi-year patterns in crop type sequences, proving its importance for consistent yearly land-cover mapping.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-Bench establishes a large-scale benchmark evaluating 100 U-Net variants on 28 datasets across 10 imaging modalities, addressing gaps in performance evaluation, generalization, and efficiency while introducing the U-Score metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper stems from the lack of a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate U-Net variants for medical image segmentation, considering various factors such as statistical validation, efficiency, and generalization across diverse datasets.

Method: The authors developed U-Bench, a rigorous benchmark evaluating U-Net variants across three dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. A novel metric, U-Score, was introduced to capture performance-efficiency trade-offs.

Result: U-Bench systematically analyzes 100 U-Net variants on diverse datasets, providing insights on model performance and dataset characteristics. The team provides guidance for model selection using findings from the evaluation.

Conclusion: U-Bench addresses evaluation gaps in U-Net research and lays the groundwork for reproducible, fair, and deployment-oriented benchmarking of segmentation models, facilitating future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

*Ori nizan,Oren Shrout,Ayellet Tal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel image retrieval method focused on identifying shared central concepts rather than just visual or semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional image retrieval methods by identifying deeper conceptual relationships in images.

Method: The authors propose modeling neighborhood relationships in the embedding space using a bimodal Gaussian distribution for retrieving conceptually similar images.

Result: Their approach demonstrates effectiveness through qualitative analysis, quantitative data, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves meaningful concept identification in image retrieval, advancing beyond traditional similarity-based methods.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of unsupervised object discovery in images, a significant computer vision problem without reliance on human-annotated labels.

Method: DADO integrates attention mechanisms with a depth model, employing dynamic weighting to adapt feature emphasis based on image characteristics.

Result: DADO surpasses state-of-the-art techniques across benchmarks in accuracy and robustness for object discovery.

Conclusion: DADO demonstrates effective identification and localization of objects without supervision, pushing forward innovations in self-supervised computer vision models.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper critiques Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) relying on CLIP for explainable AI, highlighting CLIP's concept hallucination issue and introducing a mitigation technique called CHILI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Concept Bottleneck Models relying on CLIP, specifically CLIP's concept hallucination undermining the faithfulness of explanations.

Method: The authors introduce CHILI, a method leveraging localized interpretability to disentangle image embeddings and localize target pixels for concepts, enhancing explainability.

Result: The CHILI technique mitigates concept hallucination and improves saliency-based explanations, providing more faithful and interpretable results.

Conclusion: CHILI effectively addresses concept hallucinations in CBMs and enhances the generation of interpretable saliency-based explanations.

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoRe, a training-free method to improve monocular 3D modeling by refining geometry, achieving better cross-view consistency and scale alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D models face challenges like scale ambiguity and cross-view consistency, limiting their broader applicability in 3D vision tasks.

Method: The method, MoRe, uses feature matching and a graph-based optimization framework with local planar approximations to refine 3D geometry and address scale issues.

Result: MoRe enhances 3D reconstructions and improves novel view synthesis, especially under sparse view rendering conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates its utility in refining monocular 3D foundation models, broadening their effectiveness in vision applications.

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based approach to improve controlled image synthesis in medical imaging using Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlled generation in medical imaging is difficult due to the lack of semantic structure and strong priors in existing DPM latent spaces.

Method: The paper uses graph-based object-level representations processed by transformers and integrates them into a diffusion model via text-conditioning to enable precise control.

Result: This approach is validated in histopathology, showing that the generated images can effectively replace annotated patient data in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Graph-based representation and fine-grained control bridge the gap in medical image synthesis, offering practical use for downstream applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the few-shot adaptation capabilities of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) using a structured benchmark and identifies variability in their adaptation abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the insufficiently explored ability of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models to generalize under low-data scenarios, particularly in few-shot adaptation.

Method: Performed comprehensive experiments on ten datasets using five few-shot adaptation methods applied to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with different backbones.

Result: Discovered that models with similar zero-shot performance have varying performance in few-shot conditions, with no single adaptation strategy emerging as the best.

Conclusion: The variability in adaptation performance underscores the need for more robust few-shot adaptation methods, and the study provides a benchmarking framework and open-source code for future research.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: The paper addresses the assessment challenges of visual token compression in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and proposes a new evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating visual token compression methods are poorly suited for this task due to their original design purposes, leading to task mismatches and noisy results.

Method: The authors explore the performance of various compression methods, including image downsampling, and propose a new evaluation framework called VTC-Bench, which incorporates data filtering to improve benchmark reliability.

Result: Simple image downsampling often outperforms more advanced compression techniques on standard benchmarks, and the proposed VTC-Bench framework helps denoise these benchmarks for fairer evaluation.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks are noisy and do not accurately assess visual token compression. VTC-Bench provides a more reliable and fair method for evaluating these techniques, supported by the study's observations.

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

Method: The framework uses camera-dependent normal maps from oriented partial point clouds to reduce ambiguity and employs a novel video diffusion model to integrate information from multiple sources.

Result: Experiments across three datasets show state-of-the-art performance and improved robustness, validating MV-Performer's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MV-Performer enhances human-centric 4D novel view synthesis with synchronized video generation and significant robustness, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

### [220] [Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191)
*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of Meta's DINOv3 self-supervised learning (SSL) model for chest radiography against other models across datasets, backbones, and resolutions, determining practical applications and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to assess whether design improvements in Meta's DINOv3 self-supervised learning (SSL) model enhance its capability to transfer learning to chest radiography, a domain with high volumes and fine-grained detail.

Method: The study benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization using seven datasets with over 814,000 samples. Two backbones, ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B, were tested at resolutions of 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. Performance was measured primarily using mean AUROC across labels, and frozen features from a larger 7B model were also analyzed.

Result: The results showed that at 224x224 resolution, DINOv3 performed similarly to DINOv2 on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 improved DINOv3's performance over both DINOv2 and ImageNet, especially for ConvNeXt-B, whereas no significant gains were seen in the pediatric cohort. Higher resolutions (1024x1024) yielded no additional benefits.

Conclusion: The study concludes that higher input resolutions, particularly 512x512 pixels, are crucial for optimizing SSL models in chest radiography. DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks outperformed others at this resolution, making them practical and effective choices for detecting fine abnormalities. Larger resolutions offer limited returns for this application.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

### [221] [EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07206)
*Shirin Shoushtari,Yi Wang,Xiao Shi,M. Salman Asif,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EigenScore, an OOD detection method leveraging the eigenvalue spectrum of the posterior covariance induced by diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve OOD detection, which is crucial for the safe deployment of machine learning systems in sensitive areas, by utilizing advanced diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose EigenScore, which analyzes the posterior covariance of a diffusion model and uses a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to calculate leading eigenvalues efficiently.

Result: EigenScore outperforms existing methods with up to 5% AUROC improvement and demonstrates robustness in challenging near-OOD settings.

Conclusion: EigenScore provides a reliable, state-of-the-art method for OOD detection by explicitly linking posterior covariance to distribution mismatch and is robust even in subtle distribution shifts.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes GenPilot: a system that optimizes text prompts for image synthesis models, improving text-image consistency and structural coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in accurately interpreting lengthy, complex prompts for text-to-image synthesis, and the limitations of current solutions like fine-tuning and automatic prompt optimization.

Method: Introduces GenPilot, a model-agnostic, test-time prompt optimization system that uses multi-agent systems for error analysis, adaptive exploration, verification, and memory modules.

Result: Demonstrates improvements of up to 16.9% on DPG-bench and 5.7% on Geneval in terms of text-image consistency and structural coherence.

Conclusion: GenPilot is an efficient, interpretable, and model-agnostic solution for refining complex input prompts in text-to-image synthesis. The system encourages further exploration by summarizing common error patterns and refinement strategies.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset for multi-shot human speech video generation with diverse camera views and rich annotations to support multimodal learning and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to fill the gap in datasets for generating multi-shot human speech videos, as current alternatives focus on static, single-shot viewpoints, limiting advancements in this field.

Method: They create the TalkCuts dataset with 164k high-quality clips, textual descriptions, and motion annotations, and propose Orator, a multimodal generation framework led by a language model to orchestrate video synthesis.

Result: Training on TalkCuts enhances the coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos, as demonstrated by extensive experiments across pose-guided and audio-driven settings.

Conclusion: TalkCuts offers a valuable resource for advancing research in controllable multi-shot speech video generation and multimodal learning, setting a benchmark for future studies in the field.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

*Franco Javier Arellano,José Ignacio Orlando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares Foundation Models and lightweight CNNs for automated Diabetic Macular Edema detection from retinal images, concluding that CNNs outperform FMs for fine-grained tasks despite data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited annotated data in detecting Diabetic Macular Edema with deep learning methodologies.

Method: Systematic comparison of various Foundation Models (RETFound, FLAIR) and a traditional EfficientNet-B0 CNN across datasets (IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2, OEFI) under different training regimes and evaluation metrics.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 exhibited strong and consistent performance in most scenarios, outperforming RETFound and FLAIR in fine-tuned settings, while FLAIR showed competitive zero-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNNs like EfficientNet-B0 are more reliable for fine-grained ocular tasks in data-scarce situations compared to Foundation Models, which may not handle this application effectively even after extensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Khan Muhammad,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpecGuard, a novel method for robust and invisible image watermarking by embedding messages in the frequency domain using wavelet and spectral projection techniques, showing improved performance compared to current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of robustness in existing watermarking methods against distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbations, which pose authenticity challenges in real-world applications.

Method: SpecGuard employs spectral projections—via wavelet decomposition and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approximation—to embed watermark messages in hidden convolution layers within the frequency domain. It uses a strength factor for resilience and Parseval's theorem for decoding under transformations.

Result: Experimental evaluations show SpecGuard excels in watermark invisibility, capacity, and robustness while outperforming state-of-the-art watermarking techniques.

Conclusion: SpecGuard provides a robust, efficient, and invisible image watermarking solution, overcoming existing challenges. Full code is made available for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

TL;DR: Video DiTs struggle with modeling multi-instance interactions. MATRIX-11K dataset helps analyze this issue and a regularization method called MATRIX improves interaction fidelity in video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving how video diffusion models represent subject-object interactions in multi-instance scenarios.

Method: Research includes creating a dataset (MATRIX-11K) with interaction-aware captions and masks, analyzing video diffusion models using newly defined video attention perspectives, introducing a targeted regularization method (MATRIX), and setting up InterGenEval evaluation protocol.

Result: MATRIX regularization improves interaction fidelity, semantic grounding/propagation, and reduces problems like drift and hallucination in video generation.

Conclusion: The study offers both a dataset and methods to enhance video interactions modeling, demonstrating significant advancements in aligning video generation with complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model that generates high-quality point clouds without artifacts found in existing generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues in current generative depth estimation models, specifically the flying pixel artifacts caused by using VAE for compressing depth maps.

Method: Direct diffusion generation in pixel space combined with novel designs: Semantic-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT) for semantic consistency and Cascade DiT Design for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Achieves best performance across five benchmarks and excels in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Conclusion: Pixel-Perfect Depth offers significant improvements in depth estimation by overcoming artifacts and enhancing global semantic consistency and visual details.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the computational power of quantum computing to overcome limitations in classical computer vision methods, particularly where current solutions are too slow or only approximate.

Method: The authors conduct a holistic review of QeCV, introduce its fundamentals, and outline methodologies compatible with quantum hardware. They focus on gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing and provide insights into tools for programming and simulating quantum computers.

Result: The paper organizes a comprehensive reference for QeCV, describing its operational principles, methodologies, and tools. It curates a review of existing quantum learning resources and identifies open challenges.

Conclusion: The paper establishes QeCV as a promising interdisciplinary field and provides a foundational resource to guide future research, development of specialized algorithms, and exploration of its societal impacts.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) task by using a novel framework called Temporal Prompt Generation and Selection (Tenet) to efficiently utilize image-based foundation segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of dense mask annotation-based RVOS methods that are computation-heavy and less scalable, the authors propose a more efficient approach leveraging existing foundation segmentation models.

Method: The proposed Tenet framework decomposes RVOS into referring, video, and segmentation issues, uses object detectors/trackers to generate temporal prompts linked to query sentences, and integrates Prompt Preference Learning to assess prompt quality and adapt standard segmentation models for videos.

Result: Experiments on RVOS benchmarks confirm the Tenet framework's capability of producing high-quality masks for referred objects efficiently.

Conclusion: The Tenet framework efficiently adapts image foundation segmentation models to the RVOS scenario by addressing prompt quality, highlighting scalability and effectiveness of the methodology.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

*Raaghav Ravishankar,Sandeep Kulkarni,Sathya Peri,Gokarna Sharma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DiLi is a distributed, conditional lock-free linked list designed to handle dynamic data partitioning and load balancing across multiple machines, scaling throughput linearly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scalable and dynamic data structures to meet increasing throughput demands without downtime or reliance on static partitioning, which is prone to uneven load distribution.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of conditional lock-freedom and develop DiLi, a distributable linked list that supports dynamic partitioning and load balancing while maintaining lock-free operations.

Result: Empirical evaluations show DiLi matches state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures in single-machine environments and achieves linear throughput scaling in distributed setups.

Conclusion: DiLi offers a scalable, efficient, and distributed solution with conditional lock-freedom, catering to modern database needs without compromising on performance or reliability.

Abstract: Modern databases use dynamic search structures that store a huge amount of
data, and often serve them using multi-threaded algorithms to support the
ever-increasing throughput needs. When this throughput need exceeds the
capacity of the machine hosting the structure, one either needs to replace the
underlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a
long down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of
the data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven
load distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later
will require downtime.
  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication
support from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion
of conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation
with reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present
DiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that
can be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists
and (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi
contains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the
underlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as
the client operations.
  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary
search on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable
number of linked nodes. As a result, we are able to empirically show that DiLi
performs as well as the state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures
that are based off of a linked list when executed on a single-machine. We also
show that the throughput of DiLi scales linearly with the number of machines
that host it.

*Martin Wilhelm,Franz Freitag,Max Tzschoppe,Thilo Pionteck*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation framework for predicting makespan in heterogeneous computing systems comprising CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. It bridges the gap between abstract analytical methods and real-world performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in predicting task mapping impacts on performance in heterogeneous systems, focusing on the lack of practical yet fast prediction methods that don't require lengthy task implementations.

Method: They develop a flexible evaluation framework that uses high-level task graph descriptions to collect real-world makespan data, allowing analysis of analytical prediction accuracy.

Result: The framework aids in analyzing actual makespan predictions versus theoretical estimates, highlighting common issues like data transfer overhead and device congestion in heterogeneous setups.

Conclusion: The framework assists algorithm developers by identifying challenges in makespan prediction and improving the understanding of the gap between analytical methods and practical outcomes in heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Heterogeneous computing systems, which combine general-purpose processors
with specialized accelerators, are increasingly important for optimizing the
performance of modern applications. A central challenge is to decide which
parts of an application should be executed on which accelerator or, more
generally, how to map the tasks of an application to available devices.
Predicting the impact of a change in a task mapping on the overall makespan is
non-trivial. While there are very capable simulators, these generally require a
full implementation of the tasks in question, which is particularly
time-intensive for programmable logic. A promising alternative is to use a
purely analytical function, which allows for very fast predictions, but
abstracts significantly from reality. Bridging the gap between theory and
practice poses a significant challenge to algorithm developers. This paper aims
to aid in the development of rapid makespan prediction algorithms by providing
a highly flexible evaluation framework for heterogeneous systems consisting of
CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, which is capable of collecting real-world makespan
results based on abstract task graph descriptions. We analyze to what extent
actual makespans can be predicted by existing analytical approaches.
Furthermore, we present common challenges that arise from high-level
characteristics such as data transfer overhead and device congestion in
heterogeneous systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The astronomical range of protein sequences and structures makes computational protein design highly resource-intensive, necessitating innovative methods and infrastructure.

Method: The paper proposes IMPRESS, which couples machine learning and AI with high-performance computing to evaluate and improve protein design protocols, along with dynamic resource allocation and asynchronous execution techniques.

Result: IMPRESS leads to better protein design consistency and enhanced throughput, enabling more effective exploration of possible protein structures.

Conclusion: The framework provides an adaptable and scalable solution to address computational challenges in protein design, marking advancements in both AI-driven methods and computational infrastructure.

Abstract: Computational protein design is experiencing a transformation driven by
AI/ML. However, the range of potential protein sequences and structures is
astronomically vast, even for moderately sized proteins. Hence, achieving
convergence between generated and predicted structures demands substantial
computational resources for sampling. The Integrated Machine-learning for
Protein Structures at Scale (IMPRESS) offers methods and advanced computing
systems for coupling AI to high-performance computing tasks, enabling the
ability to evaluate the effectiveness of protein designs as they are developed,
as well as the models and simulations used to generate data and train models.
This paper introduces IMPRESS and demonstrates the development and
implementation of an adaptive protein design protocol and its supporting
computing infrastructure. This leads to increased consistency in the quality of
protein design and enhanced throughput of protein design due to dynamic
resource allocation and asynchronous workload execution.

*Raaghav Ravishankar,Sandeep Kulkarni,Nitin H Vaidya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses checkpointing in weakly consistent distributed databases, introducing a minimal-overhead algorithm to ensure strong consistency snapshots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalies from eventual consistency in distributed systems necessitate frequent, consistent checkpoints for user reliability without excessive overhead.

Method: The paper defines size-minimal checkpointing, presenting an algorithm that uses O(n) messages and a single counter, achieving consistency with minimal overhead.

Result: The proposed algorithm creates strongly consistent snapshots from a weakly consistent system while improving performance over traditional methods.

Conclusion: DTCS effectively allows users to focus on consistent snapshots during anomalies in eventually consistent systems, enhancing reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: We focus on the problem of checkpointing in fully replicated weakly
consistent distributed databases, which we refer to as Distributed Transaction
Consistent Snapshot (DTCS). A typical example of such a system is a main-memory
database that provides strong eventual consistency. This problem is important
and challenging for several reasons: (1) eventual consistency often creates
anomalies that the users do not anticipate. Hence, frequent checkpoints to
ascertain desired invariants is highly beneficial in their use, and (2)
traditional checkpoints lead to significant overhead and/or inconsistencies. By
showing that the traditional checkpoint leads to inconsistencies or excessive
overhead, we define the notion of size-minimal checkpointing for fully
replicated databases. We present an algorithm for checkpointing with minimal
checkpointing overhead (only O(n) new messages and addition of a single counter
for existing messages). It also provides a significant benefit over existing
checkpointing algorithms for distributed systems and main-memory databases.
  A key benefit of DTCS is that it summarizes the computation by a sequence of
snapshots that are strongly consistent even though the underlying computation
is weakly consistent. In essence, when anomalies arise in an eventually
consistent system, DTCS enables one to concentrate solely on the snapshots
surrounding the time point of the anomaly.

### [234] [REACH: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Microservice Rescheduling in the Cloud-Edge Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06675)
*Xu Bai,Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam,Rajkumar Buyya,Adel N. Toosi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new reinforcement learning-based algorithm, REACH, to optimize microservice placement in dynamic cloud-edge environments, achieving significant latency reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging latency-sensitive applications require faster responses, which cloud computing may fail to deliver effectively due to its centralized nature. The cloud-edge continuum offers a hybrid solution, but managing microservices optimally within this heterogeneous setup is a challenge.

Method: REACH uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt the placement of microservices in cloud-edge infrastructure based on real-time resource and performance variations.

Result: Experimental evaluations of REACH on real-world testbeds reveal it achieves notable reductions in end-to-end latency (7.9%, 10%, and 8% across three MSA benchmarks).

Conclusion: The proposed REACH algorithm improves latency and mitigates spikes effectively, showcasing its potential in optimizing microservice deployment in cloud-edge setups.

Abstract: Cloud computing, despite its advantages in scalability, may not always fully
satisfy the low-latency demands of emerging latency-sensitive pervasive
applications. The cloud-edge continuum addresses this by integrating the
responsiveness of edge resources with cloud scalability. Microservice
Architecture (MSA) characterized by modular, loosely coupled services, aligns
effectively with this continuum. However, the heterogeneous and dynamic
computing resource poses significant challenges to the optimal placement of
microservices. We propose REACH, a novel rescheduling algorithm that
dynamically adapts microservice placement in real time using reinforcement
learning to react to fluctuating resource availability, and performance
variations across distributed infrastructures. Extensive experiments on a
real-world testbed demonstrate that REACH reduces average end-to-end latency by
7.9%, 10%, and 8% across three benchmark MSA applications, while effectively
mitigating latency fluctuations and spikes.

*Boris Sedlak,Philipp Raith,Andrea Morichetta,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUDAP, a multi-dimensional autoscaling platform optimized for Edge devices, featuring service-specific scaling and a regression-based agent (RASK) that achieves better performance with fewer SLO violations compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices often face resource constraints, limiting their ability to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for stream processing services. Existing autoscaling mechanisms primarily focus on resource scaling, leaving a gap in sustaining the SLOs of competing services.

Method: The authors developed MUDAP, which enables fine-grained vertical scaling across service- and resource-level dimensions. It employs the RASK scaling agent, which uses Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge to efficiently explore solution spaces and learn an optimal regression model for scaling actions.

Result: RASK was experimentally compared with Kubernetes VPA and a reinforcement learning agent. It demonstrated an ability to infer accurate regression models in 20 iterations and achieved 28% fewer SLO violations while handling higher request loads.

Conclusion: MUDAP and its RASK agent are effective in optimizing the performance of Edge devices under resource constraints, providing superior SLO compliance and elasticity compared to existing autoscaling approaches.

Abstract: Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations
where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing
autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require
alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing
services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling
Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both
service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling
tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a
particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a
scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The
RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous
regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling
actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and
a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge
device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in
merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding
elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less
SLO violations, compared to baselines.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the performance of four NVIDIA GPUs with GROMACS workloads and benchmarks, revealing insights into frequency scaling, power capping, and optimal configurations for molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations are computationally intensive, and their performance depends heavily on GPU hardware choices and configurations. This study aims to provide practical guidance on optimizing GPU usage for these workflows.

Method: Performance analysis of NVIDIA GPUs (A40, A100, L4, L40) using six GROMACS biomolecular workloads and two synthetic benchmarks to assess frequency scaling and power capping behaviors.

Result: Different scaling behaviors were observed: smaller GROMACS systems show frequency sensitivity, while larger ones are memory-bound. High-end GPUs like A100 retain near-maximum efficiency under power constraints.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable insights into GPU selection and optimization for MD simulations, aiding computational biophysics experts in improving large-scale workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational
biophysics, but their performance depend heavily on hardware choices and
configuration. In this work, we presents a comprehensive performance analysis
of four NVIDIA GPU accelerators -- A40, A100, L4, and L40 -- using six
representative GROMACS biomolecular workloads alongside two synthetic
benchmarks: Pi Solver (compute bound) and STREAM Triad (memory bound). We
investigate how performance scales with GPU graphics clock frequency and how
workloads respond to power capping. The two synthetic benchmarks define the
extremes of frequency scaling: Pi Solver shows ideal compute scalability, while
STREAM Triad reveals memory bandwidth limits -- framing GROMACS's performance
in context. Our results reveal distinct frequency scaling behaviors: Smaller
GROMACS systems exhibit strong frequency sensitivity, while larger systems
saturate quickly, becoming increasingly memory bound. Under power capping,
performance remains stable until architecture- and workload-specific thresholds
are reached, with high-end GPUs like the A100 maintaining near-maximum
performance even under reduced power budgets. Our findings provide practical
guidance for selecting GPU hardware and optimizing GROMACS performance for
large-scale MD workflows under power constraints.

*Vasileios Titopoulos,Kosmas Alexandridis,Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for accelerating the FlashAttention algorithm on vector processors using the RISC-V ISA, leveraging vectorization, low-cost exponential approximations, and tiling strategies for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms are central to many AI and ML models, but their computational demands are significant. The study aims to optimize the performance of FlashAttention, particularly on vector processors, to make them more efficient.

Method: The authors vectorized the FlashAttention algorithm, reduced reliance on scalar code, utilized low-cost approximations for exponential computations, and employed tiling strategies to enhance memory locality without extending the RISC-V ISA.

Result: The vectorized implementation demonstrated notable scalability and substantial performance improvements in processing attention layers during practical experiments.

Conclusion: This study provides a pathway for optimizing attention mechanisms on vector processors, offering significant computational efficiency while maintaining compatibility with the existing RISC-V ISA.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

### [238] [The Effect of Label Noise on the Information Content of Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06401)
*Ali Hussaini Umar,Franky Kevin Nando Tezoh,Jean Barbier,Santiago Acevedo,Alessandro Laio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how label noise affects the hidden representations in deep learning models using Information Imbalance as a computational metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely understudied impact of label noise on hidden network representations.

Method: Systematic comparison of hidden representations via Information Imbalance, a proxy for conditional mutual information.

Result: Hidden representation information shows a double descent with network parameters. Overparameterized networks remain robust to label noise. Training on random labels produces representations inferior to random features.

Conclusion: Overparameterized networks generalize well despite label noise, with cross-entropy loss decreasing information imbalance between key network layers.

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

### [239] [Context-Aware Inference via Performance Forecasting in Decentralized Learning Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06444)
*Joel Pfeffer,J. M. Diederik Kruijssen,Clément Gossart,Mélanie Chevance,Diego Campo Millan,Florian Stecker,Steven N. Longmore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a forecasting model to improve decentralized learning networks by predicting model performance dynamically and boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for combining multiple model predictions in decentralized learning networks face challenges in adapting quickly to changing conditions due to their reliance on historical performance updates.

Method: The authors proposed using machine learning to forecast prediction performance at each epoch, enabling context-aware weighting by emphasizing models likely to be accurate at specific times.

Result: The proposed forecasting models that predict regret metrics improved network inference accuracy compared to traditional methods based on historical averages.

Conclusion: Performance forecasting shows promise for decentralizing learning networks and can be applied to dynamic predictive weighting in various domains for adaptability and improved results.

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Peng Wu,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPMM-CFL, a nonparametric Federated Learning method that determines the number and members of client clusters dynamically to improve performance under client heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CFL methods require a fixed number of clusters, limiting their adaptability when the latent structure of clients is unknown.

Method: The proposed method uses a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior for Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the number of clusters and client assignments, optimizing each cluster’s federated objectives.

Result: Experimental validation on benchmark datasets with non-IID client partitioning demonstrates improved clustering and federated learning performance.

Conclusion: DPMM-CFL effectively combines clustering inference and federated optimization, offering a better solution for cases with unknown client heterogeneity.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks, ensuring reliability and robustness in predictive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a calibration measure that incentivizes predictors to provide true probabilities, addressing previous issues of non-truthfulness in calibration measures, especially for multi-class predictions.

Method: The authors extended calibration measures from binary to multi-class settings, identified methods that maintain truthfulness, and mathematically proved and empirically demonstrated robustness in their proposed measure.

Result: The proposed calibration measure maintains truthfulness, robustly ranks predictors regardless of hyperparameters, and overcomes the non-robustness issues identified in prior measures like binned ECE.

Conclusion: The paper advances calibration measures by introducing a truthful and robust metric for multi-class tasks, enabling more reliable probabilistic predictions.

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

Motivation: Traditional data science lifecycles may be insufficient for ensuring versatility, agility, and iterative improvements in business processes.

Method: The authors propose a new spiral technique, which emphasizes continuous iteration, adaptability, and agility tailored to business goals.

Result: The paper asserts that the spiral technique transforms how data science projects address clear business outcomes, making it more versatile and efficient.

Conclusion: The spiral technique enhances productivity and competitiveness by offering an adaptive, iterative methodology to align data science processes with business objectives.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data
science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their
competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important
contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data
science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are
involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or
cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible
in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after
reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate
data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

*Eliot Shekhtman,Yichen Zhou,Ingvar Ziemann,Nikolai Matni,Stephen Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances understanding of sequential learning in multi-trajectory data settings through instance-optimal rates using the Hellinger localization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address incomplete understanding of multi-trajectory sequential learning and develop better bounds beyond traditional reductions.

Method: Utilizes the Hellinger localization framework for maximum likelihood estimation, involving squared Hellinger distance control and trajectory Fisher information-based localization.

Result: Achieved instance-optimal bounds scaling with the full data budget under broad conditions, including case studies like Markov chains and linear-attention sequence models.

Conclusion: The approach substantially improves over standard methods and nearly achieves instance-optimal rates across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning in uncertain systems, reducing computational costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of hyperparameter tuning for systems with inherent uncertainty and noisy evaluations.

Method: The authors created a Bayesian optimization framework using a surrogate model for stochastic systems and derived a closed-form solution for the random acquisition function to minimize iterations.

Result: The method reduces required data points by 40 times compared to Monte Carlo-based approaches, leading to a 40-fold decrease in computational cost.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and computationally efficient for hyperparameter tuning in systems with noise, as demonstrated through computational engineering examples.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Medix, a new framework for improving OOD detection by leveraging unlabeled data and the robustness of the median operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of using unlabeled data for OOD detection due to its mixed nature and the absence of a clear set of OOD samples.

Method: Medix identifies potential outliers using the median as a detection mechanism, then uses these outliers and labeled InD data to train a robust OOD classifier. Theoretical error bounds are also derived.

Result: Medix achieves a lower error rate and outperforms existing methods in open-world settings, validated by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Conclusion: Medix provides a stable and effective solution for OOD detection by leveraging unlabeled data and median-based mechanisms, improving performance over prior methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free, stateful multi-agent evolutionary search framework to improve multi-step reasoning tasks for unit test generation, outperforming stateless baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of stateless inference and task-specific fine-tuning, which struggle with multi-step reasoning and long-horizon dependencies in tasks like code generation.

Method: The method involves a stateful, multi-agent evolutionary search framework that utilizes persistent inference-time state, adversarial mutation, and evolutionary preservation. Specialized agents sequentially generate, mutate, and score candidates, with a controller maintaining state across generations.

Result: The approach demonstrates substantial gains in coverage for unit test generation tasks, evaluated on benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini, using three different LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT.

Conclusion: Incorporating persistent inference-time state and evolutionary search enables the discovery of robust, high-coverage edge cases, highlighting the framework's potential to improve reasoning in unit-test generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

TL;DR: The paper identifies that neural networks with large width and zero-mean nonlinear activation functions yield nearly independent outputs, proposing them as suitable models for studying AI interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the conditions that make neural network outputs nearly independent and connect them to AI interpretability limits.

Method: The authors examine the role of nonlinear activation functions (with zero mean under Gaussian distribution) in random initialization of neural networks with large width.

Result: Neural networks with zero-mean nonlinear activation functions, such as shifted ReLU, GeLU, and tanh, achieve nearly independent outputs under random initialization.

Conclusion: Zero-mean nonlinear activation functions enhance the independence of neural network outputs and could be a valuable tool for exploring AI interpretability frameworks.

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

### [248] [Scalable Policy-Based RL Algorithms for POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06540)
*Ameya Anjarlekar,Rasoul Etesami,R Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses computational challenges in solving POMDPs by transforming them into Superstate MDPs, leveraging theoretical guarantees and policy-based learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the difficulties associated with the continuous belief states in POMDPs and provide an efficient solution through approximation into finite-state MDPs.

Method: The proposed method involves transforming POMDPs into Superstate MDPs, deriving theoretical guarantees for value functions, and applying policy-based learning using TD-learning and Policy Optimization.

Result: The results show that POMDPs can be approximately solved by treating them as finite-history MDPs, with errors decreasing exponentially with history length.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the approach effectively mitigates the challenges in POMDPs, with quantifiable finite-time bounds and improved theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

### [249] [The Effect of Attention Head Count on Transformer Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06662)
*Penghao Yu,Haotian Jiang,Zeyu Bao,Ruoxi Yu,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how specific structural parameters of transformers, particularly the number of attention heads, impact their expressive and approximation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the approximation properties of transformers and uncover how structural parameters like attention heads affect their ability to model complex functions.

Method: The authors introduce a generalized D-retrieval task and provide theoretical upper and lower bounds on transformer parameter complexity for ε-approximation. They conduct both theoretical proofs and experimental validations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The study finds that while transformers with sufficient heads achieve efficient approximation, fewer heads require exponentially more parameters for modeling. It also demonstrates that a single-head transformer can still memorize inputs if embedding dimensions scale with sequence length.

Conclusion: The research provides new theoretical insights into transformer efficiency based on head count and validates them through experiments, offering practical relevance for sequence modeling tasks.

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

*Yunzhen Yao,Lie He,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents non-asymptotic bounds on the efficiency of conformal prediction in regression tasks, highlighting its dependence on training size, calibration size, and miscoverage level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and efficiency of conformal prediction sets, which are analyzed using their size and coverage guarantees.

Method: Theoretical analysis of prediction set length deviation from the oracle interval for conformal quantile and median regression using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), under data distribution assumptions.

Result: The bounds derived are of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$, showing how factors like training and calibration size, and miscoverage level affect efficiency.

Conclusion: The identified convergence rates provide insights into optimizing data allocation to maintain prediction efficiency, and empirical results validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

*Ke Guo,Haochen Liu,Xiaojun Wu,Chen Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), a method to improve realistic traffic simulation for autonomous driving by addressing the instability seen in traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imitation learning methods like Behavior Cloning and GAIL fail to handle realism adequately in traffic simulation due to issues like covariate shift and instability in multi-agent settings.

Method: The authors propose DecompGAIL, which decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components to filter out irrelevant interactions. They also introduce a social PPO objective to boost overall realism across agents.

Result: DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark when integrated into a SMART-based backbone.

Conclusion: By addressing interaction misguidance and enhancing realism across agents, DecompGAIL improves traffic simulation and provides a more stable solution for modeling multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

*Manshika Charvi Bissessur,Efimia Panagiotaki,Daniele De Martini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how semantics influence localisation using a self-supervised framework, revealing noise-robust and semantically salient features for better interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve localisation performance and robustness by understanding the semantic influence on learned behaviour in challenging environments.

Method: Post-hoc introspection analysis on trained localisation networks with original/perturbed maps, interpretable probes like integrated gradients and attention weights, and semantic class ablation.

Result: The model emphasizes distinctive landmarks over routine clutter, effectively filtering noise and showing implicit downgrading of frequent objects.

Conclusion: Learned semantic relations enhance explainable registration despite visual and structural challenges, with integrated gradients and attention weights being reliable interpretability tools.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "1X World Model Challenge" for evaluating visual prediction capabilities in robotics, using both sampling and compression tracks, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with adapted and new models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance predictive modeling in robotics, enabling humanoid agents to reason about future visual observations efficiently within real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors proposed two tracks: (1) sampling task to forecast future image frames by adapting Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B foundation model with AdaLN-Zero and LoRA for post-training; (2) compression task relying on a Spatio-Temporal Transformer trained from scratch for discrete latent code predictions.

Result: Achieved superior performance: 23.0 dB PSNR in sampling and Top-500 CE of 6.6386 in compression, leading to first-place positions in both tracks.

Conclusion: The paper validates the efficacy of their models in predictive visual reasoning within humanoid robotic contexts, establishing benchmarks and inspiring further development in world model applications.

Abstract: World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to
reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent
states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of
real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling,
focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on
predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the
video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned
future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states
using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the
compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch.
Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386
in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

*Egor Cherepanov,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELMUR, an architecture using external layer memory to address long-term dependencies in decision-making under partial observability, achieving notable improvement across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome the limitations of existing models in retaining long-term dependencies and leveraging past insights in scenarios with partial observability and sparse rewards.

Method: ELMUR introduces an external memory architecture integrated into transformer layers, employing bidirectional cross-attention and an LRU memory module for efficient updates.

Result: ELMUR demonstrates extended effective horizons up to 100,000 times beyond conventional attention windows, achieving superior task success and performance metrics compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Structured, layer-local external memory provides a scalable and effective approach towards enhancing decision-making capabilities in complex tasks with partial observability.

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

*Khartik Uppalapati,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RareGraph-Synth, a framework to generate synthetic EHRs for ultra-rare diseases, leveraging a heterogeneous knowledge graph for realistic and privacy-sensitive data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in rare-disease research by generating synthetic EHR data that is both realistic and privacy-preserving, crucial for safe data sharing and research advancement.

Method: RareGraph-Synth incorporates knowledge graphs from five public resources, applying meta-path scores to guide a continuous-time diffusion model for generating synthetic EHR trajectories without protected health information.

Result: RareGraph-Synth achieves significant improvements in dataset realism (40–60% lower Maximum Mean Discrepancy) and privacy protection, outperforming baseline methods in fidelity and resistance to re-identification.

Conclusion: Integrating biomedical knowledge graphs into diffusion models enhances both the fidelity and privacy of synthetic datasets, facilitating safer sharing for rare-disease research.

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE) combines closed-source large language models with smaller trainable models for multi-objective discrete optimization, delivering state-of-the-art results in drug design benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges of multi-objective discrete optimization by leveraging LLMs for better exploration and expert knowledge guidance.

Method: It introduces MCCE, a hybrid framework where a frozen closed-source LLM collaborates with a smaller trainable model through reinforcement learning, supported by trajectory memory for mutual enhancement.

Result: On drug design benchmarks, MCCE demonstrates superior Pareto front quality and outperforms existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The work presents a new hybrid system paradigm, effectively combining exploration and continual learning to address optimization challenges in complex combinatorial spaces.

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RVFL-X, a complex-valued extension of RVFL networks, to improve performance on real-valued datasets, supported by two novel transformation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the use of complex numbers in neural networks for real-valued datasets by solving the challenge of transformation into complex representations.

Method: Proposes two methods for complex-valued representation generation—natural transformation and an autoencoder-based approach—integrated into RVFL-X with complex components handling datasets.

Result: RVFL-X outperforms the original RVFL network and other RNN variants consistently across 80 UCI datasets, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RVFL-X successfully leverages complex-valued representations to enhance neural network performance, maintaining efficiency and robustness across applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory Transformer, a model using transformers for improved GPS trajectory generation, addressing issues in previous diffusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of convolutional architectures in trajectory generation, such as deviations and loss of fine details, and leveraging transformer models for spatiotemporal data.

Method: A transformer backbone is designed for embedding conditional information and noise prediction, with two GPS coordinate embedding strategies analyzed.

Result: Trajectory Transformer markedly improves generation quality and mitigates deviation issues seen in prior methods, as confirmed via experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The Trajectory Transformer offers a significant advancement in GPS trajectory generation, surpassing prior convolution-based methods and producing higher-quality outputs with preserved details.

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BlockGPT, a transformer model designed for faster and more accurate precipitation forecasting, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting is critical for addressing the impacts of extreme weather events, but existing methods are either slow or inaccurate.

Method: The authors propose BlockGPT, a transformer model that uses batched tokenization and factorizes spatiotemporal data through self-attention and causal attention during video prediction.

Result: BlockGPT demonstrated superior accuracy, better event localization, and up to 31x faster inference speeds compared to state-of-the-art methods across two datasets.

Conclusion: BlockGPT effectively enhances precipitation nowcasting, providing a computationally efficient and accurate solution for real-time weather prediction.

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

TL;DR: SDAR is a novel paradigm that combines the training efficiency of autoregressive (AR) models with the parallel inference capabilities of diffusion models, achieving high-throughput sequence generation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models are computationally expensive during training, and autoregressive models lack parallel inference capabilities. SDAR aims to unify the strengths of both approaches for scalable and efficient reasoning.

Method: SDAR converts a well-trained autoregressive model into a blockwise diffusion model using lightweight adaptation, enabling autoregressive sequence generation across blocks and parallel decoding within blocks through diffusion.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SDAR preserves the performance of AR models while enabling parallel generation, scales efficiently across architectures, and achieves significant improvements in scientific reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SDAR successfully combines autoregression and diffusion methods, offering scalable, efficient, and high-performance reasoning capabilities, marking it as a practical innovation for enhancing model efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

### [261] [Flexible Swarm Learning May Outpace Foundation Models in Essential Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06349)
*Moein E. Samadi,Andreas Schuppert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models, while advanced, face challenges in dynamic and complex systems. A decentralized agent-based approach offers promising self-adaptive solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI's rapid progress raises concerns about its capabilities in handling dynamically evolving, complex systems, particularly in real-world applications like healthcare.

Method: This paper proposes a decentralized architecture using small agent networks (SANs) to handle subsets of system functions for self-adaptive solutions.

Result: Mathematical results and application evidence suggest SANs, through swarm-learning, deliver better decision-making in dynamic environments compared to monolithic foundation models.

Conclusion: While SAN-based approaches offer superior adaptability in complex environments, they trade-off in terms of reproducibility and detailed outcomes.

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Relational Transformer (RT), a model designed for zero-shot relational data modeling without requiring fine-tuning or example retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pretrained transformers lack efficient generalization to relational data due to its diversity and complex schema dependencies.

Method: RT tokenizes relational data with metadata, uses masked token prediction for pretraining, and incorporates Relational Attention for leveraging key relational links.

Result: RT achieves strong zero-shot performance on relational tasks and achieves better efficiency and state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned.

Conclusion: RT offers a promising approach toward foundational models for modeling relational data with both high efficiency and effectiveness in generalization.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

### [263] [Monte Carlo Permutation Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06381)
*Tristan Cazenave*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a new algorithm building upon GRAVE for scenarios where deep reinforcement learning isn't practical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve decision-making algorithms like GRAVE, especially in contexts where computational power is limited or deep reinforcement learning techniques are unavailable.

Method: MCPS modifies the exploration term to incorporate statistics from all playouts containing the moves from the root to the node.

Result: MCPS outperforms GRAVE in two-player games, performs equivalently in multiplayer games, and benefits from abstract codes for moves.

Conclusion: MCPS advances GRAVE by removing hyperparameter dependency and achieving more robust results across various games.

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

*Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-Euclidean foundation models are vulnerable to boundary-triggered asymmetries that attackers can exploit through subtle input changes, which detectors struggle to identify.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the inherent vulnerabilities in non-Euclidean models due to boundary-driven geometric asymmetries and their implications for model security.

Method: The paper formalizes the geometric effect of boundary-triggered vulnerabilities and develops a geometry-adaptive trigger to exploit these insights in empirical evaluations.

Result: The study demonstrates that attack success increases near the boundary while conventional detection mechanisms weaken, highlighting theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Non-Euclidean models face geometry-specific vulnerabilities at boundaries, necessitating analysis-backed strategies for improving defenses without sacrificing sensitivity.

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

*Prabhant Singh,Sibylle Hess,Joaquin Vanschoren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques current benchmarks for evaluating transferability estimation metrics, showing that they are flawed and inflate metric performance. Recommendations for more realistic benchmarks are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in evaluating transferability estimation metrics, which are critical for selecting suitable pre-trained models for new target tasks.

Method: The authors conducted empirical analyses on widely used benchmarks, highlighting issues such as unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies.

Result: The analysis demonstrated that simplistic heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods due to flaws in current benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks fail to reflect real-world complexities, necessitating a shift toward more robust and realistic evaluation protocols for meaningful progress in the field.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

### [266] [Attention Sinks and Compression Valleys in LLMs are Two Sides of the Same Coin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06477)
*Enrique Queipo-de-Llano,Álvaro Arroyo,Federico Barbero,Xiaowen Dong,Michael Bronstein,Yann LeCun,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys in large language models (LLMs), attributing both phenomena to massive activations in the residual stream of the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and unify two puzzling phenomena in LLMs—attention sinks and compression valleys—that have previously been studied separately.

Method: The paper combines theoretical proofs, experimental studies across various LLM sizes (410M-120B parameters), and ablation studies to investigate the connection between massive activations, attention sinks, and compression valleys.

Result: The findings confirm that massive activations in the residual stream lead to representational compression, resulting in both attention sinks and compression valleys. Experiments validate the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The authors propose the Mix-Compress-Refine theory, which explains token processing in three distinct phases within Transformers. This framework clarifies task-dependent differences in representations and the computing depth optimal for embedding versus generation tasks.

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

*Sanjeda Akter,Ibne Farabi Shihab,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential-EDFL introduces a statistical approach for stopping the generation of language models, reducing generation length and computational overhead while maintaining formal error control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficient generation stopping in language models while ensuring statistical guarantees and maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: The method involves using anytime-valid sequential testing based on self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes. It introduces 'skeleton' baselines, online mean estimation, mixture e-processes, and adaptive resets. Automated skeleton variations like distilled submodels and randomized logits are included.

Result: The approach reduced language model generation by 22-28% across benchmarks while maintaining delta-level error control with only 12% computational overhead. The proposed system also reduced the need for verification by 83%.

Conclusion: Sequential-EDFL effectively reduces generation length in language models and supports error control, serving as a first-stage filter rather than a definitive solution for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATLO-ML, a system to optimize input time length and sampling rate in time-series data for improved machine learning predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in selecting optimal input time length and sampling rate, which are critical for accurate time-series predictions.

Method: ATLO-ML dynamically determines optimized input time lengths and sampling rates based on user-defined output requirements. It is validated with air quality datasets.

Result: Optimized time length and sampling rate improved prediction accuracy compared to fixed parameters. Validation was carried out using air quality datasets, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: ATLO-ML enhances predictive performance in machine learning workflows and shows potential for broad application in time-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

*Anne Dranowski,Yura Kabkov,Daniel Tubbenhauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to automatically recognize knots from images combining machine learning models like CNNs and transformers with traditional algorithms for computing quantum invariants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to simplify knot recognition and classification by automating the process using modern computational methods.

Method: A two-stage strategy integrating machine learning models for visual recognition and symbolic algorithms for invariant computation.

Result: Lightweight CNNs and transformers successfully predict structural information like crossing numbers directly from knot images.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the synergy between data-driven machine learning models and symbolic reconstruction for improving knot classification.

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

### [270] [Incoherence in goal-conditioned autoregressive models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06545)
*Jacek Karwowski,Raymond Douglas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores incoherence in reinforcement learning caused by naive goal-conditioned autoregressive models and shows how retraining policies improve this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address incoherence in reinforcement learning policies and understand how re-training these policies on their actions can mitigate this problem and improve performance.

Method: The authors analyze incoherence mathematically and use a re-framing of control-as-inference and soft-Q learning to show their findings. They explore re-training by connecting it to temperature-related and reward-folding insights.

Result: The work proves that re-training reduces incoherence and leads to better policy returns. It also sheds light on the computational trade-offs between training and inference.

Conclusion: Retraining reinforcement learning policies reduces structural incoherence, enhances returns, and links this process to soft-conditioning of generative models and the effective horizon.

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

*Milad Aghajohari,Kamran Chitsaz,Amirhossein Kazemnejad,Sarath Chandar,Alessandro Sordoni,Aaron Courville,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Markovian Thinking and introduces the Delethink RL environment to reduce quadratic compute costs in reasoning for LongCoT tasks, achieving efficient long-token reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL environments for reasoning LLMs incur quadratic computational costs as reasoning token lengths increase, posing scalability challenges.

Method: Introduces Markovian Thinking and the Delethink RL environment, where reasoning is structured into fixed-size state chunks with resets for linear computation and constant memory.

Result: Delethink enables a reasoning model to think up to 24K tokens using linear compute, outperforming LongCoT-RL and drastically reducing compute costs.

Conclusion: Redesigning the thinking environment offers efficient, scalable reasoning for LLMs, resolving quadratic overheads and empowering long reasoning processes efficiently.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

### [272] [StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06635)
*Yunpeng Gong,Sihan Lan,Can Yang,Kunpeng Xu,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces StruSR, a symbolic regression framework using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for enhanced expression discovery in scientific modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression methods struggle to extract physical priors directly from time series data, limiting their ability to generate expressions that reflect systemic global behavior.

Method: StruSR integrates trained PINNs and local Taylor expansions to derive structural priors from time series data. It employs genetic programming with an attribution mechanism for guiding expression evolution and a hybrid fitness function for ensuring consistency.

Result: StruSR demonstrated improvements in convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability across benchmark PDE systems when compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: StruSR provides a novel approach for symbolic regression by grounding it in physics-aware methodologies, enhancing its capability for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance pretrained Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) via an additional controller network for improved data assimilation in chaotic spatiotemporal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in using ARDMs for data assimilation in chaotic systems, where existing methods are computationally demanding and prone to errors with sparse observations.

Method: The paper introduces a lightweight controller network trained offline to preview ARDM rollouts and produce stepwise corrections during a single forward rollout, avoiding expensive computations during inference.

Result: The method outperformed four state-of-the-art baselines in terms of stability, accuracy, and physical realism across different PDEs and observation settings.

Conclusion: This framework effectively simplifies inference and improves performance in chaotic PDE data assimilation tasks. The authors plan to open source code and checkpoints.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI frameworks in clinical trials, focusing on their reliability even with poor models, and finds AI-SR as the most suitable method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI can be effectively and safely integrated into clinical trials, particularly for medical image-based disease evaluation.

Method: The authors compared two AI frameworks with human-only assessments in two randomized controlled trials using spinal X-ray image endpoints. They stress-tested AI by deliberately including bad models to measure robustness and accuracy.

Result: AI as a Supporting Reader (AI-SR) demonstrated superior reliability, maintaining valid treatment effect estimates even with degraded models and across populations.

Conclusion: AI-SR is the most appropriate AI integration approach for clinical trials, as it ensures reliable disease estimation and clinical conclusions even under adverse conditions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper assesses machine-learned operators (MLOs) for performing high-resolution inference beyond training data and introduces a new training protocol to improve their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of modeling continuous phenomena using discretely represented data, focusing on enabling robust multi-resolution inference in scientific computing.

Method: The authors comprehensively evaluate MLOs' performance in zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution tasks, analyze their weaknesses, and propose a multi-resolution training protocol to improve their reliability.

Result: Empirical findings reveal that MLOs fail in zero-shot multi-resolution inference tasks due to brittleness and susceptibility to aliasing, necessitating enhancements in their training methods.

Conclusion: MLOs are insufficient for zero-shot inference at untrained resolutions; however, the proposed training protocol mitigates aliasing issues and improves their generalization across varying resolutions.

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

TL;DR: The paper presents an integrated AI and remote-sensor system, HydroNet, for more efficient leak detection in underground water pipelines using sparse sensor deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting leaks in underground pipelines are inefficient (manual inspections) or expensive (dense sensor deployments), necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: They propose deploying a sparse network of remote sensors to gather real-time data on pipeline hydraulics, combined with HydroNet, an AI model using pipeline attributes for enhanced predictions.

Result: HydroNet, tested on a real-world campus wastewater dataset, outperforms prior systems in accuracy while requiring fewer sensors.

Conclusion: The paper argues that sparse deployment combined with AI can efficiently and accurately predict leaks across varied underground water pipeline networks.

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

*Huahui Yi,Kun Wang,Qiankun Li,Miao Yu,Liang Lin,Gongli Xi,Hao Wu,Xuming Hu,Kang Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SaFeR-VLM, a framework designed to integrate active safety measures into multimodal reasoning models, achieving high safety and helpfulness metrics without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address a significant challenge faced by multimodal large reasoning models: their vulnerability to safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, termed the 'Reasoning Tax.' Existing solutions mostly focus on output filtering, which leaves reasoning vulnerabilities unchecked.

Method: SaFeR-VLM employs four key components: a tailored safety-critical dataset (QI-Safe-10K), a reflection-based correction process for unsafe generations, structured reward modeling incorporating criteria for mitigating hallucinations and contradictions, and GRPO optimization to enhance safety trajectories during training.

Result: SaFeR-VLM achieves impressive benchmarks, surpassing models that are significantly larger in scale in safety and helpfulness metrics across six tests, including dynamic robustness against both explicit and implicit risks.

Conclusion: SaFeR-VLM successfully integrates safety into the reasoning process, demonstrating scalability, robustness, and high interpretability in safety-aware multimodal reasoning without compromising model helpfulness. Codes for replicating the research are publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.

### [278] [Angular Constraint Embedding via SpherePair Loss for Constrained Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06907)
*Shaojie Zhang,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpherePair, a novel deep constrained clustering method that addresses limitations in scalability and discriminative embedding by focusing on angular constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DCC methods face challenges in scalability and embedding quality, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose SpherePair, which uses an angular constraint embedding approach and a SpherePair loss with geometric formulation to improve clustering in angular space.

Result: SpherePair demonstrates superior performance, scalability, and usability on diverse benchmarks, preserving pairwise relationships without requiring predefined cluster numbers.

Conclusion: SpherePair is a practical and theoretically sound method for scalable constrained clustering, enabling efficient representation learning and clustering in angular spaces.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

### [279] [High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06955)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Mixout, a stochastic regularization method, for domain generalization through high masking probabilities, achieving computational efficiency and comparable performance to ensemble-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of computationally expensive ensemble methods and over-regularization issues of Dropout when applied to pre-trained models, the study aims to evaluate Mixout as a fine-tuning alternative for domain generalization.

Method: The authors use Mixout with high masking probabilities to maintain a balance between retaining pre-trained knowledge and adapting to new tasks. The method probabilistically swaps a subset of fine-tuned weights with pre-trained ones, utilizing high rates of 0.9 for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets.

Result: High-rate Mixout was tested across five domain generalization benchmarks and found to achieve out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based approaches. Additionally, it significantly reduced computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by up to 45% and memory usage by up to 90%.

Conclusion: High-rate Mixout offers a lightweight, computationally efficient alternative to ensemble methods for domain generalization without compromising performance, making it a practical option for scenarios with distribution shifts.

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

### [280] [Local Reinforcement Learning with Action-Conditioned Root Mean Squared Q-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06649)
*Frank Wu,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions" (ARQ), a value estimation method for reinforcement learning (RL), inspired by the Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of applicability of the recently proposed FF Algorithm in RL scenarios, where learning signals arise naturally, and to propose a biologically grounded alternative to backpropagation.

Method: Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ) leverage a goodness function and action conditioning for value estimation using temporal difference learning within a local RL framework.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods and even outperforms backpropagation-based algorithms in many tasks within the MinAtar and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARQ is an effective and biologically plausible alternative to traditional backpropagation in reinforcement learning, yielding strong empirical results across benchmarks.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind
Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with
backpropagation on most tasks. Code can be found at

### [281] [Revisiting Mixout: An Overlooked Path to Robust Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06982)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMixout, an enhanced version of the Mixout regularizer, to maintain robust performance of vision foundation models under distribution shifts while improving in-domain accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between improving in-domain accuracy and maintaining robustness in vision foundation models under distribution shifts during finetuning.

Method: The paper revisits Mixout with a novel perspective, analyzing key levers like masking anchor, resampling frequency, and mask sparsity. It proposes GMixout, which uses an adaptive exponential moving-average anchor and incorporates a resampling frequency hyperparameter for training regularization.

Result: GMixout demonstrates consistent gains in in-domain accuracy while surpassing existing methods like Model Soups and other parameter-efficient finetuning techniques under various distribution shifts (e.g., covariate shift, corruption, and class imbalance) across benchmarks such as ImageNet, DomainNet, iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C.

Conclusion: GMixout effectively mitigates the trade-off between accuracy and robustness, providing a computationally efficient regularization method suitable for training on consumer-grade GPUs with no inference-time overhead.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

### [282] [Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07018)
*Dung Hoang-Anh,Cuong Pham Trung Le,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses zero-shot quantization, utilizing synthetic data to train low-bit quantized models. Unlike traditional methods, it introduces sharpness minimization for better model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional zero-shot quantization ignores model sharpness, which is critical for generalization in neural networks. This gap motivates the authors to explore sharpness during synthetic data generation.

Method: The method involves using gradient matching, approximated without real data, to generate synthetic data that minimizes sharpness of the quantized models.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show improved performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art in low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: Incorporating sharpness minimization into synthetic data generation leads to better generalization and improved quantized model performance in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

### [283] [Dual Goal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06714)
*Seohong Park,Deepinder Mann,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes dual goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), encoding states by temporal distances to other states, resulting in improved performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance GCRL by addressing limitations in state representations and improving the algorithm’s ability to handle noise and recover optimal policies.

Method: They introduce dual goal representations, which encode a state using temporal distances to all other states. This theoretical framework is paired with a practical method that integrates into existing GCRL algorithms.

Result: Experiments on the OGBench task suite show consistent improvements in offline goal-reaching performance across 20 tasks with varying state and pixel-based representations.

Conclusion: The approach offers a theoretically grounded and empirically validated enhancement for GCRL algorithms, proving its utility in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

*Phillip Rothenbeck,Sai Karthikeya Vemuri,Niklas Penzel,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enhance epidemiological modeling of COVID-19 dynamics in Germany by solving the SIR model with real-world infection data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limitations of traditional compartmental models like SIR in incorporating noisy observational data for assessing public health interventions such as vaccination and containment policies.

Method: The authors use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to infection data from the Robert Koch Institute, enabling spatio-temporal estimates of COVID-19 transmission and recovery parameters across different German federal states.

Result: The study revealed strong regional variations in COVID-19 transmission behaviors and identified correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns corresponding to different pandemic phases.

Conclusion: The findings underline the capability of PINNs in conducting precise, localized, and long-term epidemiological studies to support public health decision-making.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

*Michael Keiblinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the claim that RNN cells are unnecessary in attention mechanisms for long-term tasks, introducing a recurrence-complete architecture to address limitations and improve training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fully parallelizable architectures in representing long-term agentic tasks and explore their implications for software engineering agents.

Method: The paper introduces a recurrence-complete architecture and trains it on GitHub-derived action sequences, analyzing loss patterns and sequence length efficiency.

Result: Loss follows a power law relative to sequence length, with longer-sequence training yielding lower loss despite linearly increasing wall-time costs.

Conclusion: Recurrence-complete models demonstrate promising results for long-term input aggregation and optimization, contradicting the notion that attention mechanisms alone are sufficient for complex tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW, a hybrid deep learning architecture combining CNNs and transformers, for improved multivariate time series forecasting. It reports superior accuracy and explainability over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging the local pattern detection of CNNs and the long-range dependency modeling of transformers.

Method: A hybrid model combines CNNs for extracting local features and reducing dimensionality from raw data, with a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) serving as the backbone to model temporal dependencies. SHAP-MHAW is employed for interpretability.

Result: The proposed CNN-TFT achieved state-of-the-art performance with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2% on hydroelectric natural flow datasets, outperforming established deep learning models.

Conclusion: The CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW architecture is highly effective for multivariate time series forecasting, contributing both superior accuracy and model interpretability.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

*Zuherman Rustam,Sri Hartini,Sardar M. N. Islam,Fevi Novkaniza,Fiftitah R. Aszhari,Muhammad Rifqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machines, to improve bankruptcy prediction accuracy for banks, and demonstrates high accuracy for both commercial and rural banks using historical data from Turkey and Indonesia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bank stability is crucial for financial system stability, and traditional statistical models have limited accuracy in predicting bank failures, necessitating new, more effective methods.

Method: The research employs machine learning techniques (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines) to develop and test bankruptcy prediction models using historical financial data from banks in Turkey and Indonesia.

Result: The random forest method achieved 90% accuracy for commercial banks, and the other machine learning techniques accurately predicted rural bank bankruptcy likelihood. Machine learning outperforms traditional statistical methods.

Conclusion: Machine learning is a viable tool for improving bank bankruptcy prediction, and its adoption could reduce bankruptcy costs and enhance financial stability.

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN) for scalable, flexible, and efficient power system operations, achieving substantial computational speedups and minimal optimality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenge of solving AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) for large-scale power systems, especially in scenarios requiring adaptability to topology changes.

Method: The paper introduces HH-MPNN, a neural network framework that incorporates distinct modeling for power system elements and leverages scalable transformer architectures to handle long-range dependencies. This approach enables zero-shot adaptability across various grid topologies.

Result: HH-MPNN achieved less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies and less than 3% gap on unseen ones, with training only on default grids. It also provides computational speedups of 1,000x to 10,000x compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical advances in generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations, demonstrating scalability and adaptability without requiring expensive retraining.

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

Abstract: The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to
high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this,
we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a
heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention
mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data.
Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN
captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing

Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream
cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,
MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a method improving Transformer efficiency by unbalancing head allocations to better focus on signals rather than noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention in transformers often allocates excessive attention to redundant/noisy information, reducing efficiency.

Method: Proposes GDA with unbalanced head allocation, prioritizing signal extraction while stabilizing noise control, and employs scalable strategies for selective head replication.

Result: Experiments show GDA with moderate imbalance ratios improves generalization and stability over symmetric baselines.

Conclusion: Ratio-aware head allocation and selective expansion in GDA provide practical solutions for scalable, efficient Transformer designs.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

*ZiHeng Huang,Di Wu,Jun Bai,Jiale Zhang,Sicong Cao,Ji Zhang,Yingjie Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of fairness and realistic benchmarking in Federated Unlearning (FU), introducing a novel method called FedCCCU that outperforms existing approaches in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenges in Federated Learning (FL) where machine unlearning is needed to enforce data deletion rights, particularly focusing on the overlooked aspect of fairness and the unrealistic evaluation benchmarks used in existing FU methods.

Method: The proposed method, Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), is designed to be fairness-aware and explicitly addresses the issues of client fairness and data heterogeneity in FU. It introduces scalable and practical solutions to these problems.

Result: Experimental results reveal that current FU methods underperform under real-world data heterogeneity and fairness conditions. In contrast, FedCCCU delivers significantly better performance in these realistic settings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that FedCCCU offers a more practical and scalable solution for Federated Unlearning, effectively addressing the fairness and heterogeneity challenges overlooked by other methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.

### [293] [HTMformer: Hybrid Time and Multivariate Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07084)
*Tan Wang,Yun Wei Dong,Tao Zhang,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTMformer, a Transformer-based model enhanced with Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME) for improved time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in time series forecasting face limitations due to overemphasis on temporal dependencies and reliance on embedding methods, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME), combining lightweight temporal and multivariate feature extraction, integrated into the Transformer architecture.

Result: HTMformer achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to baselines, demonstrated through experiments on eight real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The use of multidimensional embeddings enhances Transformer-based time series forecasting, balancing computational complexity and performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Qi Hu,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTCN-G, a deep learning framework combining Gated Temporal Convolutional Networks and Graph Neural Networks, specifically addressing class imbalance in intrusion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern network threats are complex and traffic data often exhibit class imbalance, making intrusion detection challenging.

Method: The framework integrates G-TCN for hierarchical temporal feature extraction and GCN for graph structure learning, using residual learning via Graph Attention Networks to address class imbalance.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT show GTCN-G surpasses baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class classification.

Conclusion: GTCN-G effectively handles data imbalance, enhances detection of minority classes, and improves intrusion detection accuracy, demonstrating its utility against modern network threats.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

### [295] [Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07286)
*Jigang Fan,Xiaoran Jiao,Shengdong Lin,Zhanming Liang,Weian Mao,Chenchen Jing,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoIF, a lightweight model for estimating mutation fitness in proteins, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein engineering requires effective methods to predict fitness impacts of mutations, but current approaches are limited by the vast sequence space and scarce experimental data.

Method: EvoIF integrates profiles of homologous sequences and structural-evolutionary constraints using compact transitions to provide calibrated fitness predictions.

Result: EvoIF demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset while requiring only 0.15% of the training data compared to large existing models.

Conclusion: Integrating evolutionary signals from multiple levels enhances prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse protein functions and mutations.

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-Smith is a fully automated tool that generates high-quality machine learning engineering tasks from raw datasets, addressing scalability and applicability issues in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The creation of machine learning engineering benchmarks is constrained by low scalability and the extensive manual effort required for generating and curating high-quality tasks.

Method: The paper introduces MLE-Smith, a multi-agent pipeline with a generate-verify-execute paradigm. It incorporates structured task design, standardized refactoring, and hybrid verification mechanisms to ensure task quality and realism.

Result: MLE-Smith applied to 224 datasets generated 606 tasks across multiple categories and modalities. The performance of LLMs on these tasks correlates strongly with results on human-designed tasks, validating the system's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MLE-Smith provides a scalable solution to automate and diversify machine learning engineering tasks, ensuring both quality and real-world relevance.

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

*Sumeet Ramesh Motwani,Alesia Ivanova,Ziyang Cai,Philip Torr,Riashat Islam,Shital Shah,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Charles London*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance long-horizon reasoning in large language models by constructing synthetic, multi-step problems using only short-horizon data and training using outcome-only rewards with a curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks, and existing solutions relying on inference-time scaffolding or step-level supervision are not scalable.

Method: The method involves synthetic composition of simple problems into complex multi-step tasks, training models with outcome-only rewards, and employing a curriculum that increases in complexity for scalable reinforcement learning.

Result: The approach significantly improves performance on long-horizon benchmarks, boosting accuracy by up to 2.06x on competition-level tests and demonstrating generalization beyond baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed curriculum RL method efficiently scales long-horizon reasoning using only existing short-horizon data, providing a novel and scalable solution to this problem.

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system where single neurons can efficiently memorize and recall multiple images, achieving robust memory and recall functionality.

Method: Develop a model comprising a single neuron cluster ('Cue Ball') paired with multi-layer networks ('Recall Net') for simultaneous storage and recall of images.

Result: The model demonstrates the ability to recall all stored images when one is presented, even when only partial information is available.

Conclusion: The proposed associative memory neural model effectively enables simultaneous and complete recall of memorized images using single neuron activation.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network model (associative memory model) for
memory and recall of images. In this model, only a single neuron can memorize
multi-images and when that neuron is activated, it is possible to recall all
the memorized images at the same time. The system is composed of a single
cluster of numerous neurons, referred to as the "Cue Ball," and multiple neural
network layers, collectively called the "Recall Net." One of the features of
this model is that several different images are stored simultaneously in one
neuron, and by presenting one of the images stored in that neuron, all stored
images are recalled. Furthermore, this model allows for complete recall of an
image even when an incomplete image is presented

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized Sparse Ternary GEMM kernel for Apple's M-series processors, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEMM libraries do not efficiently handle Sparse Ternary cases on Apple Silicon CPUs, creating a need for optimized computational strategies.

Method: The authors developed architecture-specific optimizations, including blocked and interleaved sparse data formats, ILP-enhancing strategies, and NEON SIMD vectorization.

Result: The scalar implementation improved performance by up to 5.98x and utilized 50.2% of theoretical peak performance, while the vectorized version achieved up to 5.59x performance gains.

Conclusion: The proposed optimizations effectively improve Sparse Ternary GEMM operations on Apple M-series processors, showcasing stability across different sparsity levels.

Abstract: Sparse Ternary General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) remains
under-optimized in existing libraries for Apple Silicon CPUs. We present a
Sparse Ternary GEMM kernel optimized specifically for Apple's M-series
processors. We propose a set of architecture-aware optimizations, including a
novel blocked and interleaved sparse data format to improve memory locality,
strategies to increase Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP), and NEON-based
Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorization to exploit data-level
parallelism. Our scalar implementation achieves up to a 5.98x performance
increase over a traditional Ternary Compressed Sparse Column (TCSC) baseline
for large matrices with 50% ternary nonzero values (sparsity), reaching up to a
50.2% of the processor's theoretical peak performance, and remains stable
across varying sparsity levels. Our vectorized implementation delivers up to a

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces VeriEquivBench, a benchmark for formal verification of code generated by LLMs, highlighting difficulties in generating formally verifiable code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating the quality of formal specifications and code generated by LLMs, as existing benchmarks are inadequate due to their limited scope and reliance on unreliable ground-truth specifications.

Method: The authors created VeriEquivBench, a benchmark featuring 2,389 algorithmic problems, and introduced an equivalence score metric to rigorously evaluate generated outputs.

Result: The study revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle significantly with generating formally verifiable code, emphasizing the limitations in this area.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that benchmarks like VeriEquivBench are crucial to advancing scalable and reliable formal verification and improving coding agent capabilities.

Abstract: Formal verification is the next frontier for ensuring the correctness of code
generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). While methods that co-generate code
and formal specifications in formal languages, like Dafny, can, in principle,
prove alignment with user intent, progress is bottlenecked by specification
quality evaluation. Current benchmarks rely on matching against ground-truth
specifications, a manual and expertise-intensive process that has limited
existing datasets to a few hundred simple problems and also suffers from a
reliability issue. To address this, we introduce VeriEquivBench, a new
benchmark with $2,389$ complex algorithmic problems that probe the limitations
of current models in both code generation and formal reasoning. Our evaluation
framework replaces ground-truth matching with a formally grounded metric, the
equivalence score, and rigorously verifies the quality of generated
specifications and code. Our results show that generating formally verifiable
code remains a profound challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs. This underscores
both the difficulty of the task and the need for benchmarks like VeriEquivBench
to drive progress toward scalable and reliable coding agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vi-TacMan, a framework combining vision for guidance and tactile feedback for precision to manipulate articulated objects without explicit kinematic models. It achieves robust generalization across diverse objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of manipulating articulated objects in human environments, where vision-based methods lack precision and tactile methods need accurate initialization.

Method: The authors propose Vi-TacMan, which integrates vision for proposing grasps and directions with a tactile controller for refining and executing precise manipulation. It uses surface normals and von Mises-Fisher distributions for processing data.

Result: Vi-TacMan demonstrates significant performance improvements (p<0.0001) over baseline methods on both simulated and real-world articulated object manipulation tasks, achieving robust cross-category generalization.

Conclusion: This work shows that combining coarse visual cues with tactile feedback enables reliable and scalable manipulation in unstructured environments without relying on explicit kinematic models.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of articulated objects remains a fundamental
challenge for robots in human environments. Vision-based methods can infer
hidden kinematics but can yield imprecise estimates on unfamiliar objects.
Tactile approaches achieve robust control through contact feedback but require
accurate initialization. This suggests a natural synergy: vision for global
guidance, touch for local precision. Yet no framework systematically exploits
this complementarity for generalized articulated manipulation. Here we present
Vi-TacMan, which uses vision to propose grasps and coarse directions that seed
a tactile controller for precise execution. By incorporating surface normals as
geometric priors and modeling directions via von Mises-Fisher distributions,
our approach achieves significant gains over baselines (all p<0.0001).
Critically, manipulation succeeds without explicit kinematic models -- the
tactile controller refines coarse visual estimates through real-time contact
regulation. Tests on more than 50,000 simulated and diverse real-world objects
confirm robust cross-category generalization. This work establishes that coarse
visual cues suffice for reliable manipulation when coupled with tactile
feedback, offering a scalable paradigm for autonomous systems in unstructured
environments.

*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Devansh R. Agrawal,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining robust planning and active exploration for safe, informative trajectory planning, addressing the dual control problem for a quadrotor under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning safe trajectories in uncertain environments often leads to overly conservative behavior or unsafe decisions. The goal is to balance safety and uncertainty reduction in a principled manner during a mission.

Method: The authors extend their previous `gatekeeper` safety verification framework to generate trajectories that are both safe and improve knowledge of the system. The methodology uses simulations to evaluate its effectiveness, particularly for a quadrotor facing parametric uncertainty.

Result: Through simulation case studies, the proposed method achieves uncertainty reduction and completes missions within predefined cost limits, while ensuring safety throughout.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates safety and active uncertainty reduction, offering a structured approach to dual control problems in robotics, with demonstrated benefits in simulations involving a quadrotor.

Abstract: Planning safe trajectories under model uncertainty is a fundamental
challenge. Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case
realizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly
conservative behavior. Actively reducing uncertainty on-the-fly during a
nominal mission defines the dual control problem. Most approaches address this
by adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the
nominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration
of when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods
but not in others. We propose a framework that integrates robust planning with
active exploration under formal guarantees as follows: The key innovation and
contribution is that exploration is pursued only when it provides a verifiable
improvement without compromising safety. To achieve this, we utilize our
earlier work on gatekeeper as an architecture for safety verification, and
extend it so that it generates both safe and informative trajectories that
reduce uncertainty and the cost of the mission, or keep it within a
user-defined budget. The methodology is evaluated via simulation case studies
on the online dual control of a quadrotor under parametric uncertainty.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel robotic planning method that combines large language models (LLMs) with symbolic planning for improved reliability and repeatability, achieving high success rates in both simulation and real-world evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of LLM-based robotics planning, such as hallucinations and lack of transparency, while addressing the scalability challenges of symbolic planning to create more reliable and repeatable systems for complex real-world tasks.

Method: The authors propose augmenting LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight, offering transparent hard-constraint definitions while maintaining LLMs' reasoning and generalization capabilities in open-world scenarios.

Result: The hybrid system demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 99% success rate on the ALFWorld benchmark and 100% task success on real-world quadruped robots compared to lower success rates for standalone LLMs and symbolic planners.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach significantly enhances the reliability, repeatability, and transparency of LLM-based robotic planning while preserving flexibility and generalizability, contributing to the development of resilient embodied intelligent systems.

Abstract: Replicating human-level intelligence in the execution of embodied tasks
remains challenging due to the unconstrained nature of real-world environments.
Novel use of large language models (LLMs) for task planning seeks to address
the previously intractable state/action space of complex planning tasks, but
hallucinations limit their reliability, and thus, viability beyond a research
context. Additionally, the prompt engineering required to achieve adequate
system performance lacks transparency, and thus, repeatability. In contrast to
LLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and
repeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity
of real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments
LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and
repeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints
with considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering.
Importantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
and retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate
our approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning
benchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
a near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world
quadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure
LLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach
presents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and
transparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths:
flexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments. We hope
that this work will contribute to the broad goal of building resilient embodied
intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance navigation safety and perception in uncertain environments by unifying risk aversion and active information gathering strategies.

Method: The authors use tail-sensitive risk maps derived from Average Value-at-Risk on 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Fields for safe trajectory planning. Simultaneously, they employ Riemannian gradient descent on SE(3) to optimize Next-Best-View selection, reducing critical uncertainty for motion.

Result: The framework demonstrates integrated risk-averse path refinement and information-seeking view planning with scalable techniques for online updates in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: This research achieves a novel integration of path safety and perception planning, offering a robust solution for navigation in challenging, uncertain environments.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.

*Matthew Kim,Kensuke Nakamura,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability of latent-space safe control for robotics, addressing limitations when safety-critical features are not captured by observations, and proposes a solution using multimodal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe control techniques often require full observability and hand-designed state spaces, which can be impractical in real-world scenarios; this paper explores when learned latent state spaces suffice for safety.

Method: The authors analyze temperature-based failure scenarios, introduce a mutual information metric to detect missing safety-relevant features, and propose a multimodal training strategy informed by additional sensory inputs for shaping latent states during training.

Result: Findings demonstrate that RGB-only observations can lead to myopic safety behaviors, but the proposed multimodal-supervised training improves the latent model's ability to capture safety-critical features, validated both in simulation and on hardware.

Conclusion: Multimodal input during training can enhance the safety performance of latent-space control methods, even when only raw observations are available during deployment.

Abstract: Safe control techniques, such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, provide
principled methods for synthesizing safety-preserving robot policies but
typically assume hand-designed state spaces and full observability. Recent work
has relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state
representations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that
reconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from
current observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are
difficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as
classification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate
directly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that
safety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:
when are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we
examine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or
manufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic
safety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing
failure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual
information-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture
safety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training
strategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during
training, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our
approach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator
preventing a pot of wax from overheating.

Motivation: Transparent obstacles pose detection challenges for aerial robots due to their lack of features, which hampers depth sensors and navigation safety. Existing solutions are often expensive or computationally heavy.

Method: The proposed framework combines data from a ToF camera and ultrasonic sensor with a lightweight 2D convolution model that detects reflections and updates the depth map to visualize transparent obstacles.

Result: Experiments validate the method in controlled and real-world environments, showcasing accurate mapping of transparent obstacles like glass in indoor scenarios.

Conclusion: This system effectively enables low-SWaP quadrotors to reliably navigate areas with transparent obstacles using an efficient, CPU-based pipeline.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world
scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to
reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for
traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can
cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and
potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to
accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often
rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational
burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.
In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for
detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our
method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor
with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach
accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into
corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent
obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a
small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system
through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,
demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot
maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the
first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle
mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAISE, an autonomous laboratory for optimizing liquid formulations and assessing surface wettability using Bayesian Optimization. The system automates processes like liquid mixing, droplet placement, and contact angle measurement for high-throughput analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface wettability is crucial for designing biomedical devices, coatings, and textiles, and depends heavily on liquid formulation. There is a need for efficient and automated methods to link liquid formulation optimization with wettability assessment.

Method: RAISE is a closed-loop, self-driving lab equipped with tools for liquid formulation preparation, automated image capture, and contact angle measurement. It integrates Bayesian Optimization to iteratively refine formulations based on user-defined objectives.

Result: RAISE demonstrated the ability to explore surfactant combinations and optimize formulations for specific goals such as target contact angles, surfactant usage reduction, and cost savings. It achieves approximately one contact angle measurement per minute.

Conclusion: RAISE efficiently links liquid formulations to contact angle assessments in a closed-loop system, enabling precise and optimal formulation identification through multi-objective Bayesian Optimization aligned with custom researcher-defined criteria.

Abstract: Surface wettability is a critical design parameter for biomedical devices,
coatings, and textiles. Contact angle measurements quantify liquid-surface
interactions, which depend strongly on liquid formulation. Herein, we present
the Robotic Autonomous Imaging Surface Evaluator (RAISE), a closed-loop,
self-driving laboratory that is capable of linking liquid formulation
optimization with surface wettability assessment. RAISE comprises a full
experimental orchestrator with the ability of mixing liquid ingredients to
create varying formulation cocktails, transferring droplets of prepared
formulations to a high-throughput stage, and using a pick-and-place camera tool
for automated droplet image capture. The system also includes an automated
image processing pipeline to measure contact angles. This closed loop
experiment orchestrator is integrated with a Bayesian Optimization (BO) client,
which enables iterative exploration of new formulations based on previous
contact angle measurements to meet user-defined objectives. The system operates
in a high-throughput manner and can achieve a measurement rate of approximately
1 contact angle measurement per minute. Here we demonstrate RAISE can be used
to explore surfactant wettability and how surfactant combinations create
tunable formulations that compensate for purity-related variations.
Furthermore, multi-objective BO demonstrates how precise and optimal
formulations can be reached based on application-specific goals. The
optimization is guided by a desirability score, which prioritizes formulations
that are within target contact angle ranges, minimize surfactant usage and
reduce cost. This work demonstrates the capabilities of RAISE to autonomously
link liquid formulations to contact angle measurements in a closed-loop system,
using multi-objective BO to efficiently identify optimal formulations aligned
with researcher-defined criteria.

*Vincent Lam,Robin Chhabra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study develops a TD3-based trajectory planner for space manipulators aimed at safe and stable debris capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address safety and reliability challenges in capturing debris with space manipulators, focusing on issues like singularity avoidance, collision prevention, and stable execution.

Method: A curriculum-based multi-critic network is proposed, where one critic emphasizes tracking accuracy and the other ensures collision avoidance. Additional techniques include a prioritized experience replay buffer and evaluation using a simulated KUKA LBR iiwa manipulator.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates adaptive and safe trajectory generation in simulated debris removal missions.

Conclusion: The proposed planner effectively enables stable and reliable trajectory generation for space manipulators engaged in debris capture operations.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a model-free workspace trajectory
planner for space manipulators using a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) agent to enable safe and reliable debris capture. A local
control strategy with singularity avoidance and manipulability enhancement is
employed to ensure stable execution. The manipulator must simultaneously track
a capture point on a non-cooperative target, avoid self-collisions, and prevent
unintended contact with the target. To address these challenges, we propose a
curriculum-based multi-critic network where one critic emphasizes accurate
tracking and the other enforces collision avoidance. A prioritized experience
replay buffer is also used to accelerate convergence and improve policy
robustness. The framework is evaluated on a simulated seven-degree-of-freedom
KUKA LBR iiwa mounted on a free-floating base in Matlab/Simulink, demonstrating
safe and adaptive trajectory generation for debris removal missions.

### [310] [Assist-As-Needed: Adaptive Multimodal Robotic Assistance for Medication Management in Dementia Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06633)
*Kruthika Gangaraju,Tanmayi Inaparthy,Jiaqi Yang,Yihao Zheng,Fengpei Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive robotic framework using the Pepper robot to provide customized assistance for people living with dementia (PLWDs) during medication management, preserving autonomy and dignity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assistive technologies for PLWDs currently adopt a one-size-fits-all model, which fails to address progressively declining abilities in medication management and increases caregiver burden. The need exists for adaptable systems that align with occupational therapy principles to preserve autonomy and reduce dependence.

Method: The study develops an adaptive, multimodal robotic framework using LLM-driven strategies and hierarchical intervention models involving verbal, gestural, and full multi-modal assistance. The system dynamically adjusts support levels based on real-time assessment of PLWD's needs.

Result: A preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care stakeholders indicated the system's usability, appropriateness, and comprehensibility. The adaptive feedback mechanisms were empirically evaluated.

Conclusion: The research offers a theoretically validated adaptive framework that integrates occupational therapy principles into robotic design, presenting a scalable solution to support PLWDs while maintaining their dignity and autonomy.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLWDs) face progressively declining abilities in
medication management-from simple forgetfulness to complete task breakdown-yet
most assistive technologies fail to adapt to these changing needs. This
one-size-fits-all approach undermines autonomy, accelerates dependence, and
increases caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching
assistance levels to individual capabilities: minimal reminders for those who
merely forget, spatial guidance for those who misplace items, and comprehensive
multimodal support for those requiring step-by-step instruction. However,
existing robotic systems lack this adaptive, graduated response framework
essential for maintaining PLWD independence. We present an adaptive multimodal
robotic framework using the Pepper robot that dynamically adjusts assistance
based on real-time assessment of user needs. Our system implements a
hierarchical intervention model progressing from (1) simple verbal reminders,
to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance combining
physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step verbal and
gestural instructions. Powered by LLM-driven interaction strategies and
multimodal sensing, the system continuously evaluates task states to provide
just-enough assistance-preserving autonomy while ensuring medication adherence.
We conducted a preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care
stakeholders in a controlled lab setting, evaluating the system's usability,
comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms. This
work contributes: (1) a theoretically grounded adaptive assistance framework
translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, (2) a multimodal
robotic implementation that preserves PLWD dignity through graduated support,
and (3) empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic
care.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLinf-VLA, a unified framework to improve reinforcement learning (RL) training for vision-language-action (VLA) models, achieving better performance and generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in VLA models, which struggle under distribution shifts and error accumulation. Developing a unified platform for RL offers systematic comparison and improved training performance.

Method: The RLinf-VLA framework integrates rendering, training, and inference using a hybrid pipeline allocation mode to optimize RL training. It supports various architectures, RL algorithms, and simulators through a unified interface.

Result: RLinf-VLA achieved up to 98.11% task completion in LIBERO simulations and 97.66% in ManiSkill tasks, outperforming traditional methods and demonstrating effective generalization in simulation and initial real-world robotics tests.

Conclusion: The study establishes RLinf-VLA as an efficient, scalable platform for advancing embodied intelligence research, yielding strong task performance and generalization in VLA models, and providing best practices for RL integration.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly
advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge
of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained
with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under
distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through
interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified
platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and
algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and
efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a
highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of
integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In
particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel
hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup
in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse
VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a
unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25
ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best
practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns
in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a
real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger
generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a
foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.

*Yuanfei Lin,Sebastian Illing,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introducing SanDRA, the first safe decision-making framework for automated vehicles using language models and reachability analysis, ensuring safety and adherence to traffic rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the safety of automated vehicle decision-making, addressing issues of hallucination and limited dynamics integration in current language model-based approaches.

Method: SanDRA combines language models for generating driving actions and reachability analysis for eliminating unsafe options, using traffic rules formalized as temporal logic formulas.

Result: Validated in open-loop and closed-loop environments with high-density traffic, SanDRA generates provably safe and legally compliant actions with off-the-shelf and finetuned language models.

Conclusion: SanDRA improves automated vehicle decision-making by ensuring safety and compliance with traffic rules. It is transparent and open-sourced for future research.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied to knowledge-driven
decision-making for automated vehicles due to their strong generalization and
reasoning capabilities. However, the safety of the resulting decisions cannot
be ensured due to possible hallucinations and the lack of integrated vehicle
dynamics. To address this issue, we propose SanDRA, the first safe
large-language-model-based decision making framework for automated vehicles
using reachability analysis. Our approach starts with a comprehensive
description of the driving scenario to prompt large language models to generate
and rank feasible driving actions. These actions are translated into temporal
logic formulas that incorporate formalized traffic rules, and are subsequently
integrated into reachability analysis to eliminate unsafe actions. We validate
our approach in both open-loop and closed-loop driving environments using
off-the-shelf and finetuned large language models, showing that it can provide
provably safe and, where possible, legally compliant driving actions, even
under high-density traffic conditions. To ensure transparency and facilitate
future research, all code and experimental setups are publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents UniFField, a unified approach for uncertainty-aware 3D scene understanding for robotics by integrating RGB-D data incrementally, enabling zero-shot application to new environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable robots to make robust decisions in unstructured environments by addressing limitations in existing 3D neural feature fields, specifically their scene-specific nature and inability to model uncertainty.

Method: The authors propose UniFField, a voxel-based neural feature technique that integrates visual, semantic, and geometric features while predicting uncertainties across these modalities. It uses RGB-D images incrementally as the robot explores.

Result: UniFField achieves accurate uncertainty estimations for scene reconstruction and semantic predictions and is successfully employed in an active object search task using a mobile manipulator robot.

Conclusion: UniFField effectively combines features and uncertainty modeling in a generalizable representation, enhancing robust decision-making for robotic tasks.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming Euler-angle singularities and quaternion ambiguities in robot orientation, while enabling precise source-seeking and alignment in 3D environments.

Method: A proportional feed-forward controller is designed to work directly on SO(3), ensuring exponential alignment of robots to 3D scalar field sources with constant translational speed.

Result: The method demonstrated effective 3D source-seeking, adaptive to variations and preserving swarm formations, validated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The framework on SO(3 enables smooth and reproducible robot orientation and source-seeking in 3D spaces without singularities or ambiguities, with open source code available for verification.

Abstract: This paper presents a geometric control framework on the Lie group SO(3) for
3D source-seeking by robots with first-order attitude dynamics and constant
translational speed. By working directly on SO(3), the approach avoids
Euler-angle singularities and quaternion ambiguities, providing a unique,
intrinsic representation of orientation. We design a proportional feed-forward
controller that ensures exponential alignment of each agent to an estimated
ascending direction toward a 3D scalar field source. The controller adapts to
bounded unknown variations and preserves well-posed swarm formations. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, with all code provided

Result: Kirigami-based components, including actuators with programmable motions, flexible sensors, and integrated batteries, demonstrated advanced functionalities such as shape morphing and energy efficiency in robotic applications.

Conclusion: Kirigami holds significant promise for advancing robotics, with applications in grasping, locomotion, and wearable devices, but requires further research on cut pattern design and fabrication streamlining.

Abstract: Kirigami, the traditional paper-cutting craft, holds immense potential for
revolutionizing robotics by providing multifunctional, lightweight, and
adaptable solutions. Kirigami structures, characterized by their
bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and
facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components
such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be
tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators
based on kirigami principles exhibit complex motions programmable through

*Sicong Pan,Xuying Huang,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method that leverages prior information for efficient periodic 3D reconstruction of plants, reducing resource usage and improving effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Periodic plant monitoring through 3D reconstruction is resource-intensive and fails to utilize prior models from earlier cycles, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The method aligns a prior reconstructed plant model to new partial observations using non-rigid registration, inflates the model to account for growth, and optimizes view planning to minimize the required viewpoints.

Result: Experiments conducted on maize and tomato demonstrate that the proposed system achieves similar or better surface coverage with fewer views and competitive movement costs relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates temporal knowledge and optimization to enhance the efficiency and robustness of periodic plant 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when
each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information
from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for
periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the
same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an
approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate
this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a
minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that
acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and
then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and
outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under
hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves
surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using diffusion models for autonomous recovery in multi-fingered manipulation tasks, achieving significant improvements in performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of environmental perturbations and execution errors in fine manipulation tasks performed by multi-fingered hands, which can disrupt task execution.

Method: The framework leverages diffusion models to detect states unsuitable for tasks (out-of-distribution detection), project them in-distribution, and optimize recovery trajectories. A novel diffusion-based strategy is proposed to accelerate trajectory optimization.

Result: The method outperformed reinforcement learning and other baseline methods, demonstrating a 96% improvement in task performance while being the only approach to attempt recovery without catastrophic failure in hardware tests.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion model-based framework effectively enhances the robustness and reliability of recovery in contact-rich manipulation tasks, offering a significant performance boost and practicality in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine
manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or
execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery
behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take
advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that
autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich
trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to
estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an
out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to
project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan
contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full
parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the
recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution.
We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods
that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware
screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method
improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated
that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure. Videos can

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates the robustness of Vision Language Action (VLA) models under linguistic perturbations like human paraphrasing and irrelevant context, revealing significant performance drops which can be mitigated using an LLM-based filtering framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of VLA models in real-world scenarios where natural language variability and noise are present, which has not been thoroughly studied before.

Method: The study evaluates state-of-the-art VLA models under two types of linguistic perturbations: human-generated paraphrasing and the addition of irrelevant context, further categorizing irrelevant contexts based on length and semantic/lexical proximity to the commands.

Result: Findings indicate that VLA models suffer consistent performance degradation from linguistic perturbations: up to 50% drop for semantically/lexically similar irrelevant context, 20% for human paraphrases, and under 10% for random irrelevant context. A filtering framework using an LLM mitigates these issues, recovering up to 98.5% of the original performance.

Conclusion: VLA models are susceptible to natural language noise, significantly impacting their robustness. Employing an LLM-based filtering step can dramatically improve their performance under noisy conditions, highlighting the importance of pre-processing language inputs.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling
robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their
robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of
the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations.
Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction
noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant
context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to
their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In
this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size
expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to
random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and
lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of
around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To
mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core
commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to
recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.

Result: A comprehensive overview of VLA models and practical guidance for robotics applications, including categorization of references by training approach, dataset, and evaluation method.

Conclusion: The work offers a full-stack understanding and practical roadmap for deploying VLA models in real-world robotic systems, promoting scalability and novel task-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and
action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA
models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects,
embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to
enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional
task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world
deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action
representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a
comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware
components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic
review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition,
architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and
learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in
real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms,
data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation
methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this
paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying

TL;DR: The paper explores sampling strategies for generating robust locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots, emphasizing joint gain randomization for sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sim-to-real gap in quadrupedal robot locomotion, aiming to improve policy robustness through effective parameter sampling strategies.

Method: Three joint gain sampling strategies were systematically compared: mass-to-gains mappings, performance-based adaptive filtering, and uniform random sampling. Training was performed in simulation (RaiSim) and validated via zero-shot deployment on hardware (ANYmal).

Result: Results highlight the importance of joint controller gains randomization for achieving robust sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate performance improvement over baseline implementations.

Conclusion: Joint gain sampling, especially randomization, is crucial for developing robust locomotion policies that generalize across simulated and real quadruped robots.

Abstract: This work focuses on sampling strategies of configuration variations for
generating robust universal locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots. We
investigate the effects of sampling physical robot parameters and joint
proportional-derivative gains to enable training a single reinforcement
learning policy that generalizes to multiple parameter configurations. Three
fundamental joint gain sampling strategies are compared: parameter sampling
with (1) linear and polynomial function mappings of mass-to-gains, (2)
performance-based adaptive filtering, and (3) uniform random sampling. We
improve the robustness of the policy by biasing the configurations using
nominal priors and reference models. All training was conducted on RaiSim,
tested in simulation on a range of diverse quadrupeds, and zero-shot deployed
onto hardware using the ANYmal quadruped robot. Compared to multiple baseline
implementations, our results demonstrate the need for significant joint
controller gains randomization for robust closing of the sim-to-real gap.

Method: The paper introduces a digital twin-driven testing framework that uses simulation and AI, like Stable Diffusion, to generate varied driving scenarios in a controlled virtual environment. It defines metamorphic relations based on traffic rules and behavior.

Result: The framework was validated using the Udacity self-driving simulator, achieving a true positive rate of 0.719, F1 score of 0.689, and precision of 0.662, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The research establishes that integrating digital twins and AI-powered scenario generation is a scalable and effective solution for improving the safety of autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the
complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional
testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which
makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the
inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may
encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic
testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica
of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital
twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,
our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving
scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental
features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.
The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes
can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,
we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and
vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving
simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and
effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1
score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This
paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered
scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing
solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

### [322] [TrackVLA++: Unleashing Reasoning and Memory Capabilities in VLA Models for Embodied Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07134)
*Jiahang Liu,Yunpeng Qi,Jiazhao Zhang,Minghan Li,Shaoan Wang,Kui Wu,Hanjing Ye,Hong Zhang,Zhibo Chen,Fangwei Zhong,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrackVLA++ enhances embodied visual tracking with spatial reasoning and temporal memory modules, achieving state-of-the-art results and robust real-world tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve embodied visual tracking for applications like robots and assistants, addressing challenges in spatial reasoning and temporal memory under severe occlusions and distractors.

Method: TrackVLA++ introduces a spatial reasoning mechanism (Polar-CoT) and a Target Identification Memory (TIM) for spatiotemporal consistency, enabling better tracking and action prediction.

Result: Experiments show TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods on benchmarks and demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: TrackVLA++ provides a robust solution to challenges in visual tracking, excelling in both standardized benchmarks and real-world dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins
practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service
assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent
advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured
scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and
effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the
presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we
present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances
embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism
and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a
Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative
position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action
prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update
strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal
consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive
experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the
challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading
approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong
zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and
occluded scenarios.

*Jingkai Sun,Gang Han,Pihai Sun,Wen Zhao,Jiahang Cao,Jiaxu Wang,Yijie Guo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative framework for terrain-aware humanoid robot locomotion, combining efficient data synthesis, improved depth perception, and a robust locomotion policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion methods face limitations. Depth image-based approaches struggle with training inefficiencies and sim-to-real gaps, while elevation map-based methods require extensive sensors and localization, creating latency and fragility.

Method: The framework integrates three components: a terrain-aware locomotion policy with minimal visual input, a multi-modality cross-attention transformer for terrain reconstruction, and a synthetic method for realistic depth image generation with reduced error.

Result: The proposed framework successfully trains policies efficiently using limited data and resources while preserving terrain features. It achieves a 30% reduction in terrain reconstruction error and ensures generalization across diverse terrains.

Conclusion: The method overcomes traditional challenges in terrain-aware locomotion, enabling agile and adaptive humanoid robot navigation through challenging environments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot perceptive locomotion have shown
promising progress. However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely
constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and
elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training
efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the
latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems,
resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1)
Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages
pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with
minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which
reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3)
Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray
casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations,
achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination
enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources,
while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We
validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and
adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.

*Fengze Xie,Xiaozhou Fan,Jacob Schuster,Yisong Yue,Morteza Gharib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced control pipeline for fixed-wing drones using bio-inspired design and machine learning to improve aerodynamic sensing and control precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-wing UAVs, while efficient, struggle with low-speed agility due to their tightly coupled dynamics, necessitating improved sensing and control methods.

Method: The authors leveraged bio-inspired hardware (like narwhal-inspired airflow sensors), data-driven aerodynamic calibration, and machine learning to develop a control-affine dynamics model optimized with regularizations.

Result: Wind-tunnel experiments demonstrated a 25-30% reduction in force-estimation error and enhanced force tracking with smoother inputs, showing improved robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The developed system improves aerodynamic sensing and control for fixed-wing UAVs, making them more capable in diverse and challenging conditions.

Abstract: Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer endurance and efficiency but
lack low-speed agility due to highly coupled dynamics. We present an end-to-end
sensing-to-control pipeline that combines bio-inspired hardware,
physics-informed dynamics learning, and convex control allocation. Measuring
airflow on a small airframe is difficult because near-body aerodynamics,
propeller slipstream, control-surface actuation, and ambient gusts distort
pressure signals. Inspired by the narwhal's protruding tusk, we mount in-house
multi-hole probes far upstream and complement them with sparse, carefully
placed wing pressure sensors for local flow measurement. A data-driven
calibration maps probe pressures to airspeed and flow angles. We then learn a
control-affine dynamics model using the estimated airspeed/angles and sparse
sensors. A soft left/right symmetry regularizer improves identifiability under
partial observability and limits confounding between wing pressures and
flaperon inputs. Desired wrenches (forces and moments) are realized by a
regularized least-squares allocator that yields smooth, trimmed actuation.
Wind-tunnel studies across a wide operating range show that adding wing
pressures reduces force-estimation error by 25-30%, the proposed model degrades
less under distribution shift (about 12% versus 44% for an unstructured
baseline), and force tracking improves with smoother inputs, including a 27%
reduction in normal-force RMSE versus a plain affine model and 34% versus an
unstructured baseline.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIGeR is a framework that enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by enabling precise geometric computations for robotics, addressing limitations in accuracy by integrating external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models lack computational precision necessary for robotics and fail to utilize metric cues, limiting their capabilities in geometric accuracy.

Method: TIGeR transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by recognizing reasoning requirements and invoking external computational tools, supported by a specialized dataset (TIGeR-300K) and a two-stage training pipeline.

Result: TIGeR achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric reasoning benchmarks and delivers centimeter-level precision in robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: By integrating tool-based geometric reasoning, TIGeR bridges the gap between spatial reasoning and geometric computation, advancing real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial
reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and
lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current
approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera
calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks
that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic
manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel
framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric
computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric
computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize
complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to
recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate
computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To
support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive
tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose
estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,
complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,
TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while
demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation
tasks.

Method: The framework identifies optimal gearbox parameters for four types of gearboxes, minimizes mass/width, maximizes efficiency, and automates CAD generation for 3D printing.

Result: Experimental evaluations show SSPG actuators achieving 60-80% efficiency, 0.59° backlash, and 242.7 Nm/rad stiffness, while CPG actuators achieve 60% efficiency, 2.6° backlash, and 201.6 Nm/rad stiffness.

Conclusion: The COMPAct framework successfully optimizes gearbox parameters and automates actuator CAD design, offering insights into gearbox suitability over varying gear ratios and enabling direct 3D printing with improved gearbox efficiency and mechanics.

Abstract: The optimal design of robotic actuators is a critical area of research, yet
limited attention has been given to optimizing gearbox parameters and
automating actuator CAD. This paper introduces COMPAct: Computational
Optimization and Automated Modular Design of Planetary Actuators, a framework
that systematically identifies optimal gearbox parameters for a given motor
across four gearbox types, single-stage planetary gearbox (SSPG), compound
planetary gearbox (CPG), Wolfrom planetary gearbox (WPG), and double-stage
planetary gearbox (DSPG). The framework minimizes mass and actuator width while
maximizing efficiency, and further automates actuator CAD generation to enable
direct 3D printing without manual redesign. Using this framework, optimal
gearbox designs are explored over a wide range of gear ratios, providing
insights into the suitability of different gearbox types across various gear
ratio ranges. In addition, the framework is used to generate CAD models of all
four gearbox types with varying gear ratios and motors. Two actuator types are
fabricated and experimentally evaluated through power efficiency, no-load
backlash, and transmission stiffness tests. Experimental results indicate that
the SSPG actuator achieves a mechanical efficiency of 60-80 %, a no-load
backlash of 0.59 deg, and a transmission stiffness of 242.7 Nm/rad, while the
CPG actuator demonstrates 60 % efficiency, 2.6 deg backlash, and a stiffness of
201.6 Nm/rad. Code available at:

that HyPlan may navigate safer than selected relevant baselines and perform
significantly faster than considered alternative online POMDP planners.

*Altamirano Cabrera Miguel,Sautenkov Oleg,Tirado Jonathan,Fedoseev Aleksey,Kopanev Pavel,Kajimoto Hiroyuki,Tsetserukou Dzmitry*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a telemanipulation system that employs haptic feedback and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for improved tilt and position recognition of deformable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telemanipulating deformable objects demands precision, often challenged by dynamic shape changes that affect alignment perception and lead to errors.

Method: A system with the LinkGlide haptic device and Robotiq gripper sensors uses CNN to classify tilt and position, providing tactile feedback masks to aid users.

Result: Tilt and position recognition accuracy improved significantly, from 9.67% based on direct data to 82.5% using the CNN-generated mask.

Conclusion: Integrating CNN-based classification and tactile feedback into telemanipulation systems can enhance user precision and recognition of deformable object properties.

Abstract: Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity
from the users, which can be increased by kinesthetic and tactile feedback.
However, the object shape can change dynamically, causing ambiguous perception
of its alignment and hence errors in the robot positioning. Therefore, the tilt
angle and position classification problem has to be solved to present a clear
tactile pattern to the user. This work presents a telemanipulation system for
plastic pipettes consisting of a multi-contact haptic device LinkGlide to
deliver haptic feedback at the users' palm and two tactile sensors array
embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the tilt and position while
grasping deformable objects. The CNN generates a mask based on recognized tilt
and position data to render further multi-contact tactile stimuli provided to
the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN
algorithm and the preset mask, tilt, and position recognition by users is
increased from 9.67% using the direct data to 82.5%.

Motivation: To address errors in robot positioning and telemanipulation caused by ambiguous perception of deformable objects’ alignment, and to enhance users’ precision through accurate tactile haptic feedback.

Method: It uses a telemanipulation system combining a Force Dimension Omega.7 haptic interface, electro-stimulation arrays, tactile sensors in a Robotiq gripper, and CNN algorithms to generate tactile patterns from tilt detection data.

Result: The CNN-based approach increased tilt recognition accuracy from 23.13% to 57.9% and teleoperation success rates from 53.12% to 92.18%.

Conclusion: CNN-based tactile feedback systems significantly improve telemanipulation by enhancing user performance in recognizing the alignment of deformable objects and increasing precision and success rates.

Abstract: The shape of deformable objects can change drastically during grasping by
robotic grippers, causing an ambiguous perception of their alignment and hence
resulting in errors in robot positioning and telemanipulation. Rendering clear
tactile patterns is fundamental to increasing users' precision and dexterity
through tactile haptic feedback during telemanipulation. Therefore, different
methods have to be studied to decode the sensors' data into haptic stimuli.
This work presents a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes that consists

*Fikret Mert Gültekin,Oscar Lilja,Ranim Khojah,Rebekka Wohlrab,Marvin Damschen,Mazen Mohamad*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines using locally hosted large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval mechanisms to assist with cybersecurity risk assessment in safety-critical forestry systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersecurity experts are often limited in number, leaving software engineers to handle cybersecurity tasks. This creates a need for tools to aid in risk assessment and vulnerability evaluation.

Method: A design science study involving 12 experts through interviews, interactive sessions, and surveys was conducted to test locally hosted LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for cybersecurity assistance.

Result: LLMs were shown to help generate initial risk assessments, identify threats, and offer redundancy checks, but still require human oversight due to trust concerns and accuracy limitations.

Conclusion: LLM-based tools can effectively support cybersecurity experts and engineers in risk assessment for safety-critical systems, provided there is human oversight and limited reliance on generative capabilities.

Abstract: In safety-critical software systems, cybersecurity activities become
essential, with risk assessment being one of the most critical. In many
software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented
by only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these
experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct
cybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support
cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats
during the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of
leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented
generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain
while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit
external data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts
in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.
The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by
generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing
redundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight
to ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing
to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely
relying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that
encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of
cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper reviews the role of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) in addressing accessibility for visual impairments. Out of 447 papers, only 30 were found relevant, highlighting gaps in adoption, detailed techniques, and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the barriers faced by visually impaired users in software applications and propose ways to better integrate accessibility in development processes through MDE.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review, analyzing 30 primary studies out of an initial pool of 447 papers.

Result: Findings reveal insufficient inclusion of detailed modeling techniques, transformation rules, and concrete solutions for accessibility in MDE research. There is also limited end-user validation and developer expertise.

Conclusion: Current MDE research inadequately supports accessibility needs related to vision impairments. The paper proposes a research agenda to enhance integration and validation within MDE processes.

Abstract: Software applications often pose barriers for users with accessibility needs,
e.g., visual impairments. Model-driven engineering (MDE), with its systematic
nature of code derivation, offers systematic methods to integrate accessibility
concerns into software development while reducing manual effort. This paper
presents a systematic literature review on how MDE addresses accessibility for
vision impairments. From 447 initially identified papers, 30 primary studies
met the inclusion criteria. About two-thirds reference the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), yet their project-specific adaptions and
end-user validations hinder wider adoption in MDE. The analyzed studies model
user interface structures, interaction and navigation, user capabilities,
requirements, and context information. However, only few specify concrete
modeling techniques on how to incorporate accessibility needs or demonstrate
fully functional systems. Insufficient details on MDE methods, i.e.,
transformation rules or code templates, hinder the reuse, generalizability, and
reproducibility. Furthermore, limited involvement of affected users and limited
developer expertise in accessibility contribute to weak empirical validation.
Overall, the findings indicate that current MDE research insufficiently
supports vision-related accessibility. Our paper concludes with a research
agenda outlining how support for vision impairments can be more effectively
embedded in MDE processes.

*Uswat Yusuf,Genevieve Caumartin,Diego Elias Costa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores strategies for optimizing context collection for code completion in large repositories using LLMs, showcasing improvements in retrieval techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in providing relevant context for code completion in large repositories, such as limited context length and sensitivity to noisy or irrelevant data.

Method: The authors designed experiments focusing on file- and chunk-level retrieval strategies, including context size, file ordering, and static analysis for chunked retrieval.

Result: Chunk-based retrieval strategies demonstrated a 6% improvement over best file-level retrieval and a 16% improvement over a no-context baseline in Python.

Conclusion: Effective context retrieval strategies, particularly those leveraging granularity, ordering, and hybrid methods, are vital for improving LLM performance in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Context plays an important role in the quality of code completion, as Large
Language Models (LLMs) require sufficient and relevant information to assist
developers in code generation tasks. However, composing a relevant context for
code completion poses challenges in large repositories: First, the limited
context length of LLMs makes it impractical to include all repository files.
Second, the quality of generated code is highly sensitive to noisy or
irrelevant context. In this paper, we present our approach for the ASE 2025
Context Collection Challenge. The challenge entails outperforming JetBrains
baselines by designing effective retrieval and context collection strategies.
We develop and evaluate a series of experiments that involve retrieval
strategies at both the file and chunk levels. We focus our initial experiments
on examining the impact of context size and file ordering on LLM performance.
Our results show that the amount and order of context can significantly
influence the performance of the models. We introduce chunk-based retrieval
using static analysis, achieving a 6% improvement over our best file-retrieval
strategy and a 16% improvement over the no-context baseline for Python in the
initial phase of the competition. Our results highlight the importance of
retrieval granularity, ordering and hybrid strategies in developing effective
context collection pipelines for real-world development scenarios.

*Aleksi Huotala,Miikka Kuutila,Olli-Pekka Turtio,Mika Mäntylä*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AiSysRev, a tool that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to assist in title-abstract screening during systematic reviews, aiming to reduce human workload but still requiring human oversight for boundary cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conducting systematic reviews in software engineering is labor-intensive, particularly in the study selection phase. The motivation for the paper is to streamline this process by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The researchers developed AiSysRev, a web-based application powered by LLMs for screening papers. The tool supports zero-shot and few-shot modes and allows users to input inclusion and exclusion criteria, offering a mix of automated and manual review capabilities.

Result: A trial study on 137 papers found that the tool classifies papers into four categories (Easy Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, Boundary Excludes). While effective overall, the Boundary cases underscored the need for human intervention.

Conclusion: AiSysRev demonstrates that LLMs can assist in systematic reviews by reducing workload, but human judgment remains essential for correctly handling ambiguous cases.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are a standard practice for summarizing the state of
evidence in software engineering. Conducting systematic reviews is laborious,
especially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of
papers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against
inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent
research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform
title-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student.
While LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid
Reviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research,
we developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web
application running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file
containing paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion
criteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev
supports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual
screening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human
reviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our
findings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy
Includes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary
cases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human
intervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews,
they can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of

*Nicole Hoess,Carlos Paradis,Rick Kazman,Wolfgang Mauerer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates limitations and agreement issues in tools used for mining software repositories and emphasizes the care needed in tool selection and reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand threats to validity in software repository mining tools and ensure reliable outcomes from evolutionary software analysis.

Method: The authors replicate three high-profile studies on software collaboration, maintenance, and quality using four independently selected mining tools to compare data, analysis, and conclusions.

Result: The study revealed that differences in tool design lead to discrepancies in data extraction, analysis results, and sometimes conclusions when studying the same research questions.

Conclusion: Careful tool selection, evaluation of their limitations, and promoting reusability with reproduction packages can improve validity and reduce uncertainty in evolutionary software analysis.

Abstract: Context: Mining software repositories is a popular means to gain insights
into a software project's evolution, monitor project health, support decisions
and derive best practices. Tools supporting the mining process are commonly
applied by researchers and practitioners, but their limitations and agreement
are often not well understood.
  Objective: This study investigates some threats to validity in complex tool
pipelines for evolutionary software analyses and evaluates the tools' agreement
in terms of data, study outcomes and conclusions for the same research
questions.
  Method: We conduct a lightweight literature review to select three studies on
collaboration and coordination, software maintenance and software quality from
high-ranked venues, which we formally replicate with four independent,
systematically selected mining tools to quantitatively and qualitatively
compare the extracted data, analysis results and conclusions.
  Results: We find that numerous technical details in tool design and
implementation accumulate along the complex mining pipelines and can cause
substantial differences in the extracted baseline data, its derivatives,
subsequent results of statistical analyses and, under specific circumstances,
conclusions.
  Conclusions: Users must carefully choose tools and evaluate their limitations
to assess the scope of validity in an adequate way. Reusing tools is
recommended. Researchers and tool authors can promote reusability and help
reducing uncertainties by reproduction packages and comparative studies
following our approach.

### [337] [An empirical study on declined proposals: why are these proposals declined?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06984)
*Masanari Kondo,Mahmoud Alfadel,Shane McIntosh,Yasutaka Kamei,Naoyasu Ubayashi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines the proposal rejection process in the Go programming language OSS project, identifying inefficiencies and offering solutions using taxonomy and predictive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proposal rejection in OSS projects is poorly understood, leading to inefficiencies and contributor frustration during submission and review processes.

Method: A mixed-method empirical study analyzing 1,091 proposals in the Go project, involving quantitative outcomes analysis, qualitative coding for decline reasons, and LLM-based predictive modeling.

Result: Nine key reasons for proposal rejection were identified along with a GPT-based model achieving an F1 score of 0.71 for early rejection prediction.

Conclusion: Structured understanding can reduce proposal redundancy, improve submission success, and streamline review efforts using tools like LLM-based prediction models.

Abstract: Design-level decisions in open-source software (OSS) projects are often made
through structured mechanisms such as proposals, which require substantial
community discussion and review. Despite their importance, the proposal process
is resource-intensive and often leads to contributor frustration, especially
when proposals are declined without clear feedback. Yet, the reasons behind
proposal rejection remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities to
streamline the process or guide contributors effectively. This study
investigates the characteristics and outcomes of proposals in the Go
programming language to understand why proposals are declined and how such
outcomes might be anticipated. We conduct a mixed-method empirical study on
1,091 proposals submitted to the Go project. We quantify proposal outcomes,
build a taxonomy of decline reasons, and evaluate large language models (LLMs)
for predicting these outcomes. We find that proposals are more often declined
than accepted, and resolution typically takes over a month. Only 14.7% of
declined proposals are ever resubmitted. Through qualitative coding, we
identify nine key reasons for proposal decline, such as duplication, limited
use cases, or violations of project principles. This taxonomy can help
contributors address issues in advance, e.g., checking for existing
alternatives can reduce redundancy. We also demonstrate that GPT-based models
can predict decline decisions early in the discussion (F1 score = 0.71 with
partial comments), offering a practical tool for prioritizing review effort.
Our findings reveal inefficiencies in the proposal process and highlight
actionable opportunities for improving both contributor experience and reviewer
workload by enabling early triage and guiding contributors to strengthen their
proposals using a structured understanding of past decline reasons.

*Pengyue Yang,Haolin Jin,Qingwen Zeng,Jiawen Wen,Harry Rao,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents CRAI-MCF, a new framework to address issues in Large Language Model (LLM) documentation by moving from static reporting to actionable, quantitative mechanisms for responsible AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing documentation for LLMs lacks consistency, completeness, and quantitative rigor, creating barriers for model discovery and responsible adoption.

Method: Based on Value Sensitive Design and analysis of 240 projects, CRAI-MCF consolidates 217 parameters into an eight-module framework with quantitative sufficiency criteria for model comparison.

Result: CRAI-MCF successfully integrates technical, ethical, and operational evaluative dimensions into a unified approach, improving cross-model comparison and responsible adoption.

Conclusion: By streamlining model evaluation and documentation, CRAI-MCF resolves critical gaps, enabling users to confidently navigate, select, and adopt LLMs.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a burgeoning
ecosystem of specialized, domain-specific models. While this rapid growth
accelerates innovation, it has simultaneously created significant challenges in
model discovery and adoption. Users struggle to navigate this landscape due to
inconsistent, incomplete, and imbalanced documentation across platforms.
Existing documentation frameworks, such as Model Cards and FactSheets, attempt
to standardize reporting but are often static, predominantly qualitative, and
lack the quantitative mechanisms needed for rigorous cross-model comparison.
This gap exacerbates model underutilization and hinders responsible adoption.
To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Comprehensive Responsible AI
Model Card Framework (CRAI-MCF), a novel approach that transitions from static
disclosures to actionable, human-aligned documentation. Grounded in Value
Sensitive Design (VSD), CRAI-MCF is built upon an empirical analysis of 240
open-source projects, distilling 217 parameters into an eight-module,
value-aligned architecture. Our framework introduces a quantitative sufficiency
criterion to operationalize evaluation and enables rigorous cross-model
comparison under a unified scheme. By balancing technical, ethical, and
operational dimensions, CRAI-MCF empowers practitioners to efficiently assess,
select, and adopt LLMs with greater confidence and operational integrity.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper details the AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM) specification design, an extension of SPDX for AI components, validated through regulations, use cases, interviews, and a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the unexplored area of creating open standards for fast-evolving domains like AI-powered systems, where transparency and regulation compliance are critical.

Method: The methodology leverages Action Research (AR) involving over 90 contributors, including structured AR cycles, and validates the AIBOM specification using multiple approaches: regulatory alignment, industry use case mapping, practitioner interviews, and a case study.

Result: The AIBOM specification was successfully validated against regulatory frameworks, ethical standards, industry use cases, practitioner input, and real-world application.

Conclusion: The study provides a validated AIBOM specification, reflects on the AR cycle process, and offers insights for future standardization efforts within the software engineering field.

Abstract: Modern software engineering increasingly relies on open, community-driven
standards, yet how such standards are created in fast-evolving domains like
AI-powered systems remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed
experience report on the development of the AI Bill of Materials AIBOM
specification, an extension of the ISO/IEC 5962:2021 Software Package Data
Exchange (SPDX) software bill of materials (SBOM) standard, which captures AI
components such as datasets and iterative training artifacts. Framed through
the lens of Action Research (AR), we document a global, multi-stakeholder
effort involving over 90 contributors and structured AR cycles. The resulting
specification was validated through four complementary approaches: alignment
with major regulations and ethical standards (e.g., EU AI Act and IEEE 7000
standards), systematic mapping to six industry use cases, semi-structured
practitioner interviews, and an industrial case study. Beyond delivering a
validated artefact, our paper documents the process of building the AIBOM
specification in the wild, and reflects on how it aligns with the AR cycle, and
distills lessons that can inform future standardization efforts in the software
engineering community.

*Junjie Li,Fazle Rabbi,Bo Yang,Song Wang,Jinqiu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Secure-Instruct introduces a framework to enhance secure code generation by instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) with synthetic data, significantly boosting security and correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for secure code generation are limited by imbalanced datasets and insufficient generalizability, necessitating robust solutions.

Method: Secure-Instruct synthesizes secure and vulnerable code examples, generates fine-tuning instructions, and instruction-tunes LLMs to align task descriptions with secure code generation.

Result: On benchmarks like CWEBench and CWEval, Secure-Instruct improves secure code generation by 14.3% on average, outperforming SafeCoder and showing substantial gains for models like CodeLlama-7B and Mistral-7B.

Conclusion: Secure-Instruct offers a scalable and effective solution for improving the security and correctness of code generated by LLMs, advancing over existing methods like SafeCoder.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising solutions to automated
code generation, they often produce insecure code that threatens software
security. Current approaches (e.g., SafeCoder) to improve secure code
generation suffer from limited and imbalanced datasets, reducing their
effectiveness and generalizability. In this work, we present Secure-Instruct, a
novel framework that automatically synthesizes high-quality vulnerable and
secure code examples, generates fine-tuning instructions, and instruction-tunes
LLMs to align task description and secure code generation abilities. We
evaluate Secure-Instruct on four representative LLMs using two benchmarks: our
own CWEBench and the existing CWEval. CWEBench comprises 93 scenarios on 44
CWEs, all without overlap with Secure-Instruct's synthetic instruction-tuning
dataset, while CWEval covers 31 CWEs with 119 manually verified
security-critical tasks. We find that Secure-Instruct improves not only the
security but also the functional correctness of the generated code. On
CWEBench, Secure-Instruct substantially improves secure code generation, giving
a 14.3% average increase in secure ratio over the pretrained models and
outperforms SafeCoder by 7.6%. On CWEval, Secure-Instruct achieves a 14%
increase for CodeLlama-7B and 5.8% for Mistral-7B in Func-Sec@1 over pretrained
models, and surpasses SafeCoder by 15.8% and 6.8% respectively.

### [342] [Consciousness As Entropy Reduction (Short Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06297)
*Yifeng Chen,J. W. Sanders*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Consciousness as Entropy Reduction (CER) is a mathematical model simulating consciousness by organizing subconscious scenarios and selecting a conscious experience scenario, inspired by cognitive science and neural network frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding consciousness provides insights into cognitive processes and evolutionary advantages, with prior models like GWT and IIT laying groundwork.

Method: A mathematical framework based on CER organizes subconscious contents into vectors or patterns mapped to scenarios, enabling internal simulations of real-world experiments.

Result: CER demonstrates how modeling internal conscious scenarios can lead to adaptable, economic problem-solving processes, reflecting evolutionary benefits.

Conclusion: CER offers a logical and simulation-friendly approach to modeling consciousness, emphasizing internal scenario selection as a key element in cognitive adaptability and evolution.

Abstract: A model of consciousness is proposed which, having a logical basis, lends
itself to simulation using a simple mathematical model called Consciousness as
Entropy Reduction (CER). The approach has been inspired by previous models such
as GWT, IIT and an earlier less mainstream model called "Feature Map" in
Psychology. CER considers the contents of consciousness and subconsciousness as
\textit{scenarios}: a vector of patterns (or features) on various "channels"
(or feature locations). In CER, a feature map itself is not consciousness but
only the input \textit{scenario} into a world of possible subconscious
\textit{scenarios} from which the conscious \textit{scenario} (i.e., conscious
experience) is chosen. Essentially, it creates an internal simulation of the
outside world. Solving problems in simulation internally as a "thought
experiment" is obviously more economical than doing experiments in a real
environment and lends itself to adaptability and hence is a major evolutionary
advantage. CER also has connections with the Hopfield model in artificial
neural networks.

### [343] [Retrieving the structure of probabilistic sequences from EEG data during the goalkeeper game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06344)
*P. R. Cabral-Passos,P. S. Azevedo,V. H. Moraes,B. L. Ramalho,A. Duarte,C. D. Vargas*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines the relationship between EEG data and learning the structure of probabilistic event sequences through a goalkeeper game simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers sought to explore whether EEG can capture underlying patterns of a stochastic event sequence during task performance, revealing how humans learn and adapt to probabilistic sequences in real time.

Method: Participants played a goalkeeper game where they predicted probabilistic events (kick directions) while their EEG data was recorded. Context trees drove the probabilistic choices, and EEG data was analyzed to estimate sequence trees. Correlations were examined between tree distances and success rates.

Result: The EEG signal dependencies showed increasing alignment with the event sequence over time, and the EEG-derived tree distance correlated inversely with participants' success in predicting kick directions.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that EEG can reflect learning of probabilistic sequences, with neural signatures aligning with improved performance over time.

Abstract: This work draws on the conjecture that fingerprints of stochastic event
sequences can be retrieved from electroencephalographic data (EEG) recorded
during a behavioral task. To test this, we used the Goalkeeper Game
(game.numec.prp.usp.br). Acting as a goalkeeper, the participant predicted each
kick in a probabilistic sequence while EEG activity was recorded. At each
trial, driven by a context tree, the kicker chose one of three options: left,
center, or right. The goalkeeper then predicted the next kick by pressing a
button. Tree estimation was performed by applying the Context Algorithm to EEG
segments locked to the button press (-300 to 0 ms). We calculated the distance
between the penalty taker's tree and the trees retrieved per participant and
electrode. This metric was then correlated with the goalkeeper's success rates.
We observed a clear reduction in the overall distance distribution over time
for a subset of electrodes, indicating that EEG dependencies become more
congruent with the penalty taker's tree as the goalkeeper learns the sequence.
This distance is inversely proportional to the goalkeepers' success rates,
indicating a clear relationship between performance and the neural signatures
associated with the sequence structure.

### [344] [Diffusion-Guided Renormalization of Neural Systems via Tensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06361)
*Nathan X. Kodama*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores a novel approach for understanding neural systems via diffusion-based renormalization, leveraging tensor networks to link microscale and mesoscale dynamics, and creating scalable algorithms for coarse-graining neural data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks with partial observations, aiming to exploit multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and AI.

Method: The paper utilizes diffusion-based renormalization and develops scalable algorithms using tensor networks to generate symmetry-breaking representations and analyze coarse-grained neural dynamics.

Result: The approach enables the inference of community structures from subsampled neural activity and facilitates learning effective non-equilibrium dynamics of neural trajectories in low-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: The diffusion-guided renormalization framework bridges different scales in neural systems, offering tools for coarse-to-fine control applicable to systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales.
Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial
intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective
non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but
we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of
high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations.
Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent
scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely
applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical
networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent
diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics,
coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in
specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based
renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking
representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor
networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale
dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable
graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled
neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided
renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and
joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided
renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of
dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling
coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

### [345] [Utilizing Information Theoretic Approach to Study Cochlear Neural Degeneration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06671)
*Ahsan J. Cheema,Sunil Puria*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study proposes a framework using mutual information (MI) to detect cochlear nerve degeneration (CND) affecting speech comprehension while preserving clinical thresholds. Time-compressed speech optimally reveals CND compared to other conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing hidden hearing loss or cochlear neural degeneration (CND) is challenging since it impacts auditory coding without showing changes in standard hearing thresholds. Developing ways to detect CND can improve clinical practices.

Method: An information-theoretic approach was used to assess speech stimuli revealing CND. The study employed a simulated auditory model to determine mutual information loss between inner hair cell receptor potentials and auditory nerve responses across various speech conditions and fiber types.

Result: The analysis revealed progressive mutual information loss with increasing CND severity. Time-compressed speech caused the most significant information loss, contrasting with smaller effects from reverberation.

Conclusion: Time-compressed speech is identified as an effective diagnostic probe for CND, improving clinical detection approaches while recognizing limitations in using reverberation for identifying hidden hearing loss.

Abstract: Hidden hearing loss, or cochlear neural degeneration (CND), disrupts
suprathreshold auditory coding without affecting clinical thresholds, making it
difficult to diagnose. We present an information-theoretic framework to
evaluate speech stimuli that maximally reveal CND by quantifying mutual
information (MI) loss between inner hair cell (IHC) receptor potentials and
auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses and acoustic input and ANF responses.
Using a phenomenological auditory model, we simulated responses to 50 CVC words
under clean, time-compressed, reverberant, and combined conditions across
different presentation levels, with systematically varied survival of low-,
medium-, and high-spontaneous-rate fibers. MI was computed channel-wise between
IHC and ANF responses and integrated across characteristic frequencies.
Information loss was defined relative to a normal-hearing baseline. Results
demonstrate progressive MI loss with increasing CND, most pronounced for
time-compressed speech, while reverberation produced comparatively smaller
effects. These findings identify rapid, temporally dense speech as optimal
probes for CND, informing the design of objective clinical diagnostics while
revealing problems associated with reverberation as a probe.

### [346] [Gradient of White Matter Functional Variability via fALFF Differential Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06914)
*Xinle Chang,Yang Yang,Yueran Li,Zhengcen Li,Haijin Zeng,Jingyong Su*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces the use of fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to analyze functional variability in white matter (WM), highlighting its advantages over functional connectivity (FC) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing functional variability in the brain are limited by their reliance on functional connectivity (FC), which measures co-fluctuation rather than intensity, especially in white matter (WM) where signals are weaker.

Method: The paper proposes using fALFF to measure the intensity of spontaneous neural activity in WM, and introduces a method for quantifying WM functional variability through differential identifiability of fALFF.

Result: Higher differential identifiability of fALFF compared to FC reveals it is more sensitive to WM functional variability; patterns of variability are linked to structural connectivity and exhibit a spatial gradient from the brainstem to the cortex.

Conclusion: This study offers a novel perspective on WM functional variability using fALFF, uncovering patterns that align with brain evolution and opening new avenues for exploring WM function.

Abstract: Functional variability in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) is
closely associated with human brain cognitive and developmental processes, and
is commonly assessed using functional connectivity (FC). However, as a
correlation-based approach, FC captures the co-fluctuation between brain
regions rather than the intensity of neural activity in each region.
Consequently, FC provides only a partial view of functional variability, and
this limitation is particularly pronounced in WM, where functional signals are
weaker and more susceptible to noise. To tackle this limitation, we introduce
fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to measure the
intensity of spontaneous neural activity and analyze functional variability in
WM. Specifically, we propose a novel method to quantify WM functional
variability by estimating the differential identifiability of fALFF. Higher
differential identifiability is observed in WM fALFF compared to FC, which
indicates that fALFF is more sensitive to WM functional variability. Through
fALFF differential identifiability, we evaluate the functional variabilities of
both WM and GM, and find the overall functional variability pattern is similar
although WM shows slightly lower variability than GM. The regional functional
variabilities of WM are associated with structural connectivity, where
commissural fiber regions generally exhibit higher variability than projection
fiber regions. Furthermore, we discover that WM functional variability
demonstrates a spatial gradient ascending from the brainstem to the cortex by
hypothesis testing, which aligns well with the evolutionary expansion. The
gradient of functional variability in WM provides novel insights for
understanding WM function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to investigate WM functional variability via fALFF.

*Thomas Kreuz*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper reviews traditional and modern quantitative measures for analyzing spike timing and synchrony in neuronal spike trains, introducing new tools like latency correction algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve analysis of neuronal spike trains with reliable and precise timing metrics, enabling better understanding of activity synchrony and propagation.

Method: Historical review of spike train measures, introduction to latency correction algorithms, and experimental validation on synthetic and neuronal data.

Result: The research offers tools such as ISI- and SPIKE-Distance, SPIKE-Synchronization, and SPIKE-Order. Additionally, latency correction algorithms enhance alignment of sparse spike trains.

Conclusion: These measures facilitate precise spike train analysis, applicable for synthetic and real-world neuronal data, advancing neurophysiological research.

Abstract: By introducing the twin concepts of reliability and precision along with the
corresponding measures, Mainen and Sejnowski's seminal 1995 paper "Reliability
of spike timing in neocortical neurons" (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995) paved the
way for a new kind of quantitative spike train analysis. In subsequent years a
host of new methods was introduced that measured both the synchrony among
neuronal spike trains and the directional component, e.g. how activity
propogates between neurons. This development culminated with a new class of
measures that are both time scale independent and time resolved. These include
the two spike train distances ISI- and SPIKE-Distance as well as the
coincidence detector SPIKE-Synchronization and its directional companion
SPIKE-Order. This article will not only review all of these measures but also
include two recently proposed algorithms for latency correction which build on
SPIKE-order and aim to optimize the spike time alignment of sparse spike trains
with well-defined global spiking events. For the sake of clarity, all these
methods will be illustrated on artificially generated data but in each case
exemplary applications to real neuronal data will be described as well.

*Chiara Mignacco,Matthieu Jonckheere,Gilles Stoltz*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for online matching problems, improving upon traditional expert heuristics by adaptively combining them through advantage-based weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in traditional heuristics for online matching problems, especially under dynamic or non-stationary conditions in complex systems like organ exchanges or cloud services.

Method: The method builds on the Adv2 framework to orchestrate expert policies using advantage-based weighting and integrates a neural actor-critic architecture for scalability and interpretability.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed orchestrated policy achieves faster convergence and higher efficiency compared to individual experts and conventional RL baselines in stochastic matching tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights how adaptive learning through RL can effectively manage complex resource allocation problems, leveraging the strengths of expert policies in a scalable and interpretable way.

Abstract: Online matching problems arise in many complex systems, from cloud services
and online marketplaces to organ exchange networks, where timely, principled
decisions are critical for maintaining high system performance. Traditional
heuristics in these settings are simple and interpretable but typically
tailored to specific operating regimes, which can lead to inefficiencies when
conditions change. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that
learns to orchestrate a set of such expert policies, leveraging their
complementary strengths in a data-driven, adaptive manner. Building on the Adv2
framework (Jonckheere et al., 2024), our method combines expert decisions
through advantage-based weight updates and extends naturally to settings where
only estimated value functions are available. We establish both expectation and
high-probability regret guarantees and derive a novel finite-time bias bound
for temporal-difference learning, enabling reliable advantage estimation even
under constant step size and non-stationary dynamics. To support scalability,
we introduce a neural actor-critic architecture that generalizes across large
state spaces while preserving interpretability. Simulations on stochastic
matching models, including an organ exchange scenario, show that the
orchestrated policy converges faster and yields higher system level efficiency
than both individual experts and conventional RL baselines. Our results
highlight how structured, adaptive learning can improve the modeling and
management of complex resource allocation and decision-making processes.

TL;DR: This paper presents fine-grained regret bounds for model-free reinforcement learning in episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes, offering improvements over existing algorithms by addressing structural limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-free reinforcement learning algorithms offer coarse gap-dependent regret bounds that fail to properly account for the structure of suboptimality gaps.

Method: The paper develops novel analytical frameworks for UCB-based and non-UCB-based algorithms with separated analyses for optimal/suboptimal state-action pairs and refinements to existing approaches.

Result: New algorithms, ULCB-Hoeffding and a refined AMB, achieve fine-grained gap-dependent regret bounds with empirical performance improvements over previous methods.

Conclusion: The paper advances reinforcement learning by providing structurally informed regret bounds, improving theoretical understanding and algorithmic performance.

Abstract: We study fine-grained gap-dependent regret bounds for model-free
reinforcement learning in episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes. Existing
model-free algorithms achieve minimax worst-case regret, but their
gap-dependent bounds remain coarse and fail to fully capture the structure of
suboptimality gaps. We address this limitation by establishing fine-grained
gap-dependent regret bounds for both UCB-based and non-UCB-based algorithms. In
the UCB-based setting, we develop a novel analytical framework that explicitly
separates the analysis of optimal and suboptimal state-action pairs, yielding
the first fine-grained regret upper bound for UCB-Hoeffding (Jin et al., 2018).
To highlight the generality of this framework, we introduce ULCB-Hoeffding, a
new UCB-based algorithm inspired by AMB (Xu et al.,2021) but with a simplified
structure, which enjoys fine-grained regret guarantees and empirically
outperforms AMB. In the non-UCB-based setting, we revisit the only known
algorithm AMB, and identify two key issues in its algorithm design and
analysis: improper truncation in the $Q$-updates and violation of the
martingale difference condition in its concentration argument. We propose a
refined version of AMB that addresses these issues, establishing the first
rigorous fine-grained gap-dependent regret for a non-UCB-based method, with
experiments demonstrating improved performance over AMB.

*Tomohiro Hayase,Benoît Collins,Ryo Karakida*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the singular value spectrum of self-attention layers using random matrix theory, revealing deviations from established beliefs and providing a Gaussian equivalence result.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of self-attention layers in neural networks, particularly from a random matrix theory perspective.

Method: Rigorous analysis of the singular value spectrum of the attention matrix, utilizing control of fluctuations in the normalization term and refined Taylor expansions for linearization.

Result: Established that the singular value distribution is asymptotically described by a linear model, with squared singular values deviating from the Marchenko-Pastur law.

Conclusion: Self-attention, despite its complexity, admits a Gaussian equivalence in this regime, advancing the theoretical understanding of such layers.

Abstract: Self-attention layers have become fundamental building blocks of modern deep
neural networks, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited,
particularly from the perspective of random matrix theory. In this work, we
provide a rigorous analysis of the singular value spectrum of the attention
matrix and establish the first Gaussian equivalence result for attention. In a
natural regime where the inverse temperature remains of constant order, we show
that the singular value distribution of the attention matrix is asymptotically
characterized by a tractable linear model. We further demonstrate that the
distribution of squared singular values deviates from the Marchenko-Pastur law,
which has been believed in previous work. Our proof relies on two key
ingredients: precise control of fluctuations in the normalization term and a
refined linearization that leverages favorable Taylor expansions of the
exponential. This analysis also identifies a threshold for linearization and
elucidates why attention, despite not being an entrywise operation, admits a
rigorous Gaussian equivalence in this regime.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian non-parametric method to model evolving clusters in time series using Switching Linear Dynamical Systems and Gaussian process priors. It applies this method to ECG analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of efficiently modeling and evolving clusters of time series data while capturing statistical variations in amplitude and temporal alignment.

Method: The method uses a hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior, coupled with a Gaussian process prior, for modeling the parameters and variations within clusters. Inference is performed via a variational lower bound for offline and online scenarios.

Result: The paper demonstrates the method's versatility and effectiveness, specifically through case studies of electrocardiogram (ECG) data analysis using public databases.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully models unbounded time series clusters and avoids unnecessary proliferation of clusters, making it extendable to real-world scenarios like ECG data analysis.

Abstract: We present a method that models the evolution of an unbounded number of time
series clusters by switching among an unknown number of regimes with linear
dynamics. We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical
Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical
System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in
amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution
of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of
clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a
variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient
learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness
of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis
using publicly available databases.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyCFRL, a Python library aimed at ensuring counterfactual fairness in offline reinforcement learning (RL). It provides methods to preprocess data for fair policy creation and tools for evaluating fairness and values of RL policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL can optimize population-level benefits but may result in unfair decisions disadvantaging minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

Method: A novel data preprocessing algorithm is implemented in PyCFRL to learn counterfactually fair RL policies, along with tools for evaluating policy values and fairness levels.

Result: The PyCFRL library was developed and made publicly available, with its functionalities demonstrated through examples and tutorials.

Conclusion: PyCFRL serves as a valuable resource for addressing fairness concerns in RL applications by promoting counterfactual fairness in policy learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn and evaluate a sequential decision
rule, often referred to as a "policy", that maximizes the population-level
benefit in an environment across possibly infinitely many time steps. However,
the sequential decisions made by an RL algorithm, while optimized to maximize
overall population benefits, may disadvantage certain individuals who are in
minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this problem, we
introduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in
offline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning
counterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to
evaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We
describe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its
major use cases through a data example. The library is publicly available on
PyPI and Github (https://github.com/JianhanZhang/PyCFRL), and detailed
tutorials can be found in the PyCFRL documentation
(https://pycfrl-documentation.netlify.app).

*Daniela Schkoda,Dominik Janzing*

TL;DR: The paper examines how outliers propagate in cyclic causal graphs with linear equations, offering a way to trace them to their root causes without needing prior knowledge of the causal graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of outliers in causal systems can provide insights into root causes and improve diagnostics in systems with cyclic causal relationships.

Method: The authors analyze outlier propagation using linear structural equations and propose a method to identify root causes based on perturbation propagation.

Result: The study finds that root causes can be identified in a shortlist that includes the true root causes and some parent nodes within causal cycles.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables root cause identification in cyclic causal graphs without prior graph knowledge, provided perturbations are significant and follow established structural rules.

Abstract: We study the propagation of outliers in cyclic causal graphs with linear
structural equations, tracing them back to one or several "root cause" nodes.
We show that it is possible to identify a short list of potential root causes
provided that the perturbation is sufficiently strong and propagates according
to the same structural equations as in the normal mode. This shortlist consists
of the true root causes together with those of its parents lying on a cycle
with the root cause. Notably, our method does not require prior knowledge of
the causal graph.

*Baptiste Ferrere,Nicolas Bousquet,Fabrice Gamboa,Jean-Michel Loubes,Joseph Muré*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper provides an explicit decomposition for predictive models with Bernoulli inputs to improve interpretability using generalized Hoeffding decomposition concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the interpretability of predictive models, especially in cases where stochastic inputs are correlated, enabling better decision-support systems.

Method: The paper uses the generalized Hoeffding decomposition with oblique projections onto L2 subspaces, specifically tailored for Bernoulli-distributed input variables.

Result: The decomposition for Bernoulli inputs is shown to be explicit and one-dimensional, enabling straightforward calculation of influence metrics like Sobol' indices and Shapley effects.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances the interpretability of predictive models and provides tools for analyzing decision-support systems with binary models, with extensions suggested for other input types.

Abstract: Explaining the behavior of predictive models with random inputs can be
achieved through sub-models decomposition, where such sub-models have easier
interpretable features. Arising from the uncertainty quantification community,
recent results have demonstrated the existence and uniqueness of a generalized
Hoeffding decomposition for such predictive models when the stochastic input
variables are correlated, based on concepts of oblique projection onto L 2
subspaces. This article focuses on the case where the input variables have
Bernoulli distributions and provides a complete description of this
decomposition. We show that in this case the underlying L 2 subspaces are
one-dimensional and that the functional decomposition is explicit. This leads
to a complete interpretability framework and theoretically allows reverse
engineering. Explicit indicators of the influence of inputs on the output
prediction (exemplified by Sobol' indices and Shapley effects) can be
explicitly derived. Illustrated by numerical experiments, this type of analysis
proves useful for addressing decision-support problems, based on binary
decision diagrams, Boolean networks or binary neural networks. The article
outlines perspectives for exploring high-dimensional settings and, beyond the
case of binary inputs, extending these findings to models with finite countable
inputs.

*Himanshu Choudhary,Arishi Orra,Manoj Thakur*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARL, a novel framework combining DDPMs and DRL to improve portfolio management by generating crash scenarios and enhancing stress resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing portfolio management methods struggle to account for market dynamics and investor diversity, requiring innovative approaches to improve robustness.

Method: The authors propose DARL, which integrates DDPMs to simulate market stress and DRL to optimize portfolio strategies, providing enhanced training data.

Result: Empirical results show DARL achieves better risk-adjusted returns and handles crises like the 2025 Tariff Crisis more effectively than traditional methods.

Conclusion: DARL offers an advanced approach for resilient DRL-based portfolio management, leveraging stress conditioning and synthetic data generation.

Abstract: In the ever-changing and intricate landscape of financial markets, portfolio
optimisation remains a formidable challenge for investors and asset managers.
Conventional methods often struggle to capture the complex dynamics of market
behaviour and align with diverse investor preferences. To address this, we
propose an innovative framework, termed Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement
Learning (DARL), which synergistically integrates Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for
portfolio management. By leveraging DDPMs to generate synthetic market crash
scenarios conditioned on varying stress intensities, our approach significantly
enhances the robustness of training data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that DARL outperforms traditional baselines, delivering superior risk-adjusted
returns and resilience against unforeseen crises, such as the 2025 Tariff
Crisis. This work offers a robust and practical methodology to bolster stress
resilience in DRL-driven financial applications.

### [357] [Split Conformal Classification with Unsupervised Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07185)
*Santiago Mazuelas*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised calibration method for split conformal prediction, enabling the use of training samples for calibration without needing additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for split conformal prediction require separate labeled calibration samples aside from training samples, which can be inefficient and require additional labeling efforts.

Method: The proposed approach uses unsupervised calibration samples along with training samples to create set-prediction rules, eliminating the need for dedicated labeled calibration samples.

Result: Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the unsupervised calibration method achieves performance comparable to supervised calibration, with slight trade-offs in guarantees and efficiency.

Conclusion: Unsupervised calibration offers a practical alternative to supervised calibration for split conformal prediction by reducing labeling burdens, albeit with modest compromises in computational and guarantee strength.

Abstract: Methods for split conformal prediction leverage calibration samples to
transform any prediction rule into a set-prediction rule that complies with a
target coverage probability. Existing methods provide remarkably strong
performance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they require
to use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those used
for training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents the
use of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additional
labels solely for calibration. This paper presents an effective methodology for
split conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification
tasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using
unsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples
previously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental
results show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to
that with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in
performance guarantees and computational efficiency.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework unifying biomarker modeling with multi-state event processes via shared latent structures, implementing it in the Python library 'jmstate'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classical joint models lack flexibility in representing complex event dynamics. Authors aim to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive framework.

Method: The framework integrates nonlinear mixed-effects longitudinal submodels with multi-state survival processes, derives likelihood, employs stochastic gradient descent for inference, and offers dynamic prediction for risk assessment.

Result: Simulation experiments and a biomedical case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in capturing intricate longitudinal and multi-state dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology advances state-of-the-art modeling, supporting reproducibility and widespread application through the open-source 'jmstate' library.

Abstract: Classical joint modeling approaches often rely on competing risks or
recurrent event formulations to account for complex real-world processes
involving evolving longitudinal markers and discrete event occurrences.
However, these frameworks typically capture only limited aspects of the
underlying event dynamics.
  Multi-state joint models offer a more flexible alternative by representing
full event histories through a network of possible transitions, including
recurrent cycles and terminal absorptions, all potentially influenced by
longitudinal covariates.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework that unifies longitudinal
biomarker modeling with multi-state event processes defined on arbitrary
directed graphs. Our approach accommodates both Markovian and semi-Markovian
transition structures, and extends classical joint models by coupling nonlinear
mixed-effects longitudinal submodels with multi-state survival processes via
shared latent structures.
  We derive the full likelihood and develop scalable inference procedures based
on stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic prediction
framework, enabling individualized risk assessments along complex
state-transition trajectories.
  To facilitate reproducibility and dissemination, we provide an open-source
Python library \texttt{jmstate} implementing the proposed methodology,
available on \href{https://pypi.org/project/jmstate/}{PyPI}. Simulation
experiments and a biomedical case study demonstrate the flexibility and
performance of the framework in representing complex longitudinal and
multi-state event dynamics. The full Python notebooks used to reproduce the

TL;DR: The paper introduces dicodensity monads, a generalization of codensity monads, derived from mixed-variant bifunctors, and explores their applications in models of ordered nondeterministic computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to generalize codensity monads to allow construction from mixed-variant bifunctors, motivated by challenges in modeling certain polymorphic lambda calculi, such as continuation monads with universally quantified variables.

Method: The paper employs the concept of strong dinaturality (Barr dinaturality) and extends previous Cayley-style representation techniques to establish conditions for isomorphism between monads and dicodensity monads.

Result: The authors provide novel presentations of monads derived from hom-functors and bifunctors, further showcasing applications to semirings and ordered nondeterministic computation models.

Conclusion: Dicodensity monads broaden the applicability and theoretical foundation of monads, offering new tools for computation models, particularly in the realm of polymorphic lambda calculi and semiring-based theories.

Abstract: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensity
monads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors.
Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known as
Barr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types in
polymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads with
universally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monad
in System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations,
we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between a
monad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor. Then, we focus on the
class of monads obtained by instantiating our construction with hom-functors
and, more generally, bifunctors given by objects of homomorphisms (that is,
internalised hom-sets between Eilenberg--Moore algebras). This gives us, for
example, novel presentations of monads generated by different kinds of
semirings and other theories used to model ordered nondeterministic
computations.

*Gilles Barthe,Minbo Gao,Jam Kabeer Ali Khan,Matthijs Muis,Ivan Renison,Keiya Sakabe,Michael Walter,Yingte Xu,Li Zhou*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This study introduces a groundbreaking duality theorem for classical-quantum states and uses it to create a complete logical framework for analyzing classical-quantum programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical-quantum programs, integrating classical and quantum computations, lack complete relational program logics due to limitations in prior duality theorem methods.

Method: The authors use a novel dimension-independent convex optimization analysis, enabling the transition between finite and infinite classical state spaces.

Result: A new relational program logic $\\mathsf{cqOTL}$ is developed for classical-quantum programs; soundness and completeness are proven, along with extending completeness conditions for $\\mathsf{eRHL}$ and $\\mathsf{qOTL}$.

Conclusion: This work closes critical gaps in classical-quantum program analysis and enriches both probabilistic and quantum program logics, advancing theoretical computer science.

Abstract: Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it
was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and
finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively
complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs,
respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum
programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over
classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main
gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal
transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined
setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this
paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for
classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel
dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying
the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take
the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting
duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational
program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In
addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing
program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al.,
POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study introduces Quorus, a novel framework for quantum federated learning, which addresses error-prone and varied capabilities in quantum devices, improving model performance by 12.4% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in distributed quantum machine learning (QML) due to error-prone and heterogeneous quantum devices across clients.

Method: Quorus uses a layerwise loss function to train quantum models of varying depths and provides design options tailored to client needs like shot budget and qubit count.

Result: Quorus enhances the gradient magnitudes of high-depth clients and boosts testing accuracy by 12.4% on average compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Quorus effectively mitigates issues of hardware error diversity and enables efficient, adaptable distributed QML with significant performance gains.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically
intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private
clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning
(QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access
to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them
to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL
problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training
of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for
high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents
various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget,
qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and
real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of
gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on
average over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAQS, a compact quantum token mixer for text classification, achieving significant accuracy using few qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for scalable quantum NLP solutions amidst current limitations in quantum hardware and classical compute constraints.

Method: CLAQS uses a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture with l1 normalization for amplitude stability and sliding-window aggregation for long sequence text classification.

Result: CLAQS achieves 91.64% accuracy on SST-2 and 87.08% accuracy on IMDB, surpassing classical Transformer baselines and hybrid quantum-classical models using shallow circuits and eight qubits.

Conclusion: CLAQS demonstrates the feasibility of scalable quantum NLP for real-world tasks, addressing limitations in training stability, qubit count, and depth constraints.

Abstract: Quantum compute is scaling fast, from cloud QPUs to high throughput GPU
simulators, making it timely to prototype quantum NLP beyond toy tasks.
However, devices remain qubit limited and depth limited, training can be
unstable, and classical attention is compute and memory heavy. This motivates
compact, phase aware quantum token mixers that stabilize amplitudes and scale
to long sequences. We present CLAQS, a compact, fully quantum token mixer for
text classification that jointly learns complex-valued mixing and nonlinear
transformations within a unified quantum circuit. To enable stable end-to-end
optimization, we apply l1 normalization to regulate amplitude scaling and
introduce a two-stage parameterized quantum architecture that decouples shared
token embeddings from a window-level quantum feed-forward module. Operating
under a sliding-window regime with document-level aggregation, CLAQS requires
only eight data qubits and shallow circuits, yet achieves 91.64% accuracy on
SST-2 and 87.08% on IMDB, outperforming both classical Transformer baselines
and strong hybrid quantum-classical counterparts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to introduce a novel fusion mechanism for multimodal learning, leveraging quantum principles to overcome limitations of classical approaches in capturing high-order feature interactions efficiently.

Method: The Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL) employs parameterized quantum circuits to represent entangled feature interactions with linear parameter scaling, based on quantum signal processing principles.

Result: Simulation results show QFL consistently outperforming classical baselines, especially in high-modality setups, indicating its effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: QFL demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and innovative multimodal fusion approach, paving the way for further exploration in larger and more complex systems.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum fusion mechanism for
multimodal learning and to establish its theoretical and empirical potential.
The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical
fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses
parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without
requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing
principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial
interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a
separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that
highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently
outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks,
with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results
suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal
fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.

*Praveen Kumar Ranjan,Abhinav Sinha,Yongcan Cao*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a nonlinear integrated guidance and control (IGC) system for UAV formation flight, enabling flexible leader-follower dynamics while ensuring high stability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV leader-follower schemes have limitations, such as fixed follower positions and lack of flexibility during aggressive leader maneuvers.

Method: The IGC approach uses a dynamic surface control-based backstepping method incorporating Lyapunov barrier functions, mapping relative leader-follower dynamics to throttle and aerodynamic commands.

Result: The proposed system enables the follower UAV to maintain flexible formation within a hemispherical region, ensures strict constraint satisfaction, and handles aggressive leader maneuvers even in GPS-denied scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances UAV formation flight flexibility, stability, and robustness, demonstrating capabilities suitable for real-world applications through simulation results.

Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear integrated guidance and control (IGC)
approach for flexible leader-follower formation flight of fixed-wing unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) while accounting for high-fidelity aerodynamics and
thrust dynamics. Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the
follower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain
range and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and
its line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the
prescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a
hemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly
maps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the
follower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control
surface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control
subsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based
backstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,
where Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's
bearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability
analysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict
constraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The
proposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation
mismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by
transitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set
when the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on
relative information and onboard sensors without the information about the
leader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative
scenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper explores terrain-aided navigation by comparing two point cloud measurement models for aiding inertial navigation systems, emphasizing innovation error generation and model observability properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance inertial navigation systems by innovating effective nonlinear state estimation using point cloud measurements, offering an alternative to radar altimeters.

Method: Two models for generating point cloud measurements are compared: ray-casting (predicts point cloud from pose) and sliding grid (requires pose and measurement pattern, but is computationally simpler). Observability properties of altitude are assessed.

Result: Point cloud measurements outperform radar altimeters in accuracy. Sliding grid offers computational advantages, but both models have distinct characteristics.

Conclusion: Point cloud measurements are more effective than radar altimeters, with the choice of model depending on computational resources and desired accuracy.

Abstract: We investigate the use of a point cloud measurement in terrain-aided
navigation. Our goal is to aid an inertial navigation system, by exploring ways
to generate a useful measurement innovation error for effective nonlinear state
estimation. We compare two such measurement models that involve the scanning of
a digital terrain elevation model: a) one that is based on typical ray-casting
from a given pose, that returns the predicted point cloud measurement from that
pose, and b) another computationally less intensive one that does not require
raycasting and we refer to herein as a sliding grid. Besides requiring a pose,
it requires the pattern of the point cloud measurement itself and returns a
predicted point cloud measurement. We further investigate the observability
properties of the altitude for both measurement models. As a baseline, we
compare the use of a point cloud measurement performance to the use of a radar
altimeter and show the gains in accuracy. We conclude by showing that a point

*Hamidreza Montazeri Hedesh,Milad Siami*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast, risk-aware safety certification method for autonomous systems using neural network controllers, outperforming current methods in efficiency and scope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns in autonomous systems under realistic risks like delays and uncertainties, particularly for neural network-based controllers.

Method: The authors model NN controllers using local sector bounds and positivity structures, deriving linear, delay-independent certificates for local exponential stability. They compare their method against state-of-the-art IQC verification pipelines.

Result: Their method is orders of magnitude faster than IQC-based verification and certifies safety in regimes that IQC cannot manage.

Conclusion: The method provides scalable safety guarantees that complement risk-aware control, showcasing improved efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: We present a risk-aware safety certification method for autonomous, learning
enabled control systems. Focusing on two realistic risks, state/input delays
and interval matrix uncertainty, we model the neural network (NN) controller
with local sector bounds and exploit positivity structure to derive linear,
delay-independent certificates that guarantee local exponential stability
across admissible uncertainties. To benchmark performance, we adopt and
implement a state-of-the-art IQC NN verification pipeline. On representative
cases, our positivity-based tests run orders of magnitude faster than SDP-based
IQC while certifying regimes the latter cannot-providing scalable safety
guarantees that complement risk-aware control.

*Phuong Tuan Dat,Tran Huy Dat*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper improves synthetic speech detection by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the XLSR-Conformer model, achieving notable reduction in Equal Error Rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As synthetic speech attacks become more sophisticated, there is a pressing need to enhance speech detection systems to safeguard automatic speaker verification.

Method: The authors replaced the Multi-Layer Perceptron component in the XLSR-Conformer model with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), utilizing it as a universal approximator to boost detection capabilities.

Result: Experimental tests on the ASVspoof2021 dataset showed up to 60.55% relative improvement in Equal Error Rate and achieved 0.70% EER on the 21LA set.

Conclusion: Integrating KAN into SSL-based speech detection models shows significant promise, offering enhanced robustness and detection performance against synthetic speech.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly
sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic
speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning
(SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated
remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for
architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer
model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator
based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results
on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model
can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA
and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed
replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest
that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for
advances in synthetic speech detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AudioMarathon is a new benchmark to evaluate Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) on long-form audio tasks, highlighting their limitations in attention cost and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio benchmarks mostly focus on short audio clips and lack the ability to evaluate models on realistic long-context scenarios, limiting the assessment of temporal reasoning and inference efficiency for LALMs.

Method: AudioMarathon benchmarks models on a diverse range of long-context audio inputs (90-300 seconds), covers speech, sound, and music domains, and includes tasks requiring multi-hop inference. It evaluates state-of-the-art LALMs and explores token pruning and KV cache eviction techniques.

Result: Current LALMs show significant performance drops as audio length increases. Additionally, acceleration techniques reveal trade-offs and inefficiencies in handling long-form audio.

Conclusion: AudioMarathon reveals critical gaps in LALM architectures, especially in long-term dependency modeling and memory efficiency, driving the need for more advanced audio processing models.

Abstract: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language
models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention
($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio
benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in
realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce
AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and
inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set
of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations
ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of
2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,
sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We
evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio
length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs
of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across
current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and
memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio
and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding
models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

### [369] [A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Repression and Mobilization in Bangladesh's July Revolution Using Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06264)
*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Anupam Debashis Roy*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper explores how state violence intended to suppress the 2024 student-led July Revolution in Bangladesh instead fueled its success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why state repression can inadvertently amplify civil resistance, as seen in the July Revolution.

Method: The study uses mixed methods including narrative generation, panel regression, VAR analysis, structural break analysis, and machine learning.

Result: Key findings include a suppression backfire effect fueled by moral shocks, protest momentum's role, and excessive force being a top predictor of nationwide protests.

Conclusion: The July Revolution's success was propelled by non-linear backfire dynamics triggered by moral shocks and viral visuals of state brutality.

Abstract: The 2024 July Revolution in Bangladesh represents a landmark event in the
study of civil resistance. This study investigates the central paradox of the
success of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to
quell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a
mixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the
conflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a
disaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative
analysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and
mobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like
the July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial
role of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,
we specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence
for a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.
Our Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an
immediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We
further demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break
analysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in
the conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of
the first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.
A complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)
corroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying "excessive force
against protesters" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide
escalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,
non-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and
accelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper explores image transmission over multi-hop AWGN channels using DeepJSCC combined with deep hash distillation to enhance semantic consistency and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving image transmission quality across multi-hop noisy channels by addressing noise accumulation and enabling semantic clustering for security-oriented applications.

Method: Combining DeepJSCC encoder-decoder with pre-trained deep hash distillation to optimize MSE and cosine distance, enhancing semantic alignment and perceptual quality.

Result: The approach achieves superior perceptual quality and semantic alignment across multi-hop settings, as evidenced by improved LPIPS metric scores.

Conclusion: Semantic clustering via deep hash distillation improves image transmission quality and robustness over noisy multi-hop channels, overcoming classical DeepJSCC limitations.

Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding
(DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by
training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash
distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating
security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and
improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module
to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD
hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual
quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different
multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise
accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS)
metric.

*Mehdi Rabiee,Sergio Greco,Reza Shahbazian,Irina Trubitsyna*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for segmenting Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) in 3D brain MRI images by improving segmentation accuracy and reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the difficulty in detecting FCD lesions in brain MRIs due to their subtle, small-scale nature, the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the need for smooth and anatomically consistent output.

Method: The framework combines a transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture with a novel loss function integrating Dice loss and an anisotropic Total Variation term to improve spatial smoothness and remove false positives, without post-processing.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed baseline methods, showing an 11.9% improvement in Dice coefficient, 13.3% higher precision, and a 61.6% reduction in false positive clusters on a dataset with 85 epilepsy patients.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances segmentation accuracy and achieves superior anatomical consistency and smoothness, aiding in the treatment and surgical planning for FCD-associated epilepsy.

Abstract: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy
and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to
the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD
regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical
planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to
the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size
and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal
inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is
often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents
a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt
state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and
introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total
Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and
reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The
framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and
demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to
standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\%
improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the
baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by
61.6%

### [373] [SER-Diff: Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion for Incremental Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06283)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SER-Diff, a framework unifying diffusion-based refinement and incremental learning for brain tumor segmentation, resolving catastrophic forgetting and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt models for brain tumor segmentation to evolving clinical datasets without losing previously acquired knowledge.

Method: SER-Diff employs a frozen diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps for past tasks, combining Dice and knowledge distillation losses for training.

Result: SER-Diff outperforms existing methods on BraTS datasets with high Dice scores (95.8%, 94.9%, 94.6%) and low HD95 values (4.4 mm, 4.7 mm, 4.9 mm).

Conclusion: SER-Diff effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing segmentation accuracy and anatomical coherence in incremental learning contexts.

Abstract: Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt
to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However,
catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge,
remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge
distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative
replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective
for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental
learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the
first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental
learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate
synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new
tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge
distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention.
Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff
consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of
95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7
mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only
mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and
anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

*Mohammed Alsubaie,Wenxi Liu,Linxia Gu,Ovidiu C. Andronesi,Sirani M. Perera,Xianqi Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved diffusion model for accelerating MRI reconstruction by embedding iterative data consistency into every reverse diffusion step, improving image quality significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is an essential diagnostic tool but its slow acquisition time limits its utility in urgent clinical scenarios. Current undersampling strategies accelerate MRI but compromise image quality.

Method: The study introduces a conditional denoising diffusion framework that integrates data-consistency corrections at every reverse diffusion step. It also trains the model using paired undersampled-ground truth data to enforce physics-based constraints.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion methods on the fastMRI dataset in metrics like SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS. LPIPS highlighted perceptual quality improvements.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining conditional supervision and iterative consistency updates boosts both fidelity and realism in MRI reconstruction, marking progress toward faster and more reliable diagnostics.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical
diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation,
especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies
can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and
degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing
high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors;
however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score
functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a
post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising
diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs
from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every
reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground
truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit
enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that
our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning
and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing
perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that
integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields
substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism,
establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI
reconstruction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in evaluating thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) rupture risk by developing methods to accelerate and automate patient-specific aortic biomechanical modeling using deep learning and computational tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a leading cause of death, and rupture risk assessment requires computationally intensive biomechanical analyses. However, clinical adoption is hindered by the labor-intensive modeling process and time-sensitive workflows.

Method: The paper introduces an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) to directly generate patient-specific finite element meshes (FEM) of the aorta from 3D CT images. This builds on prior work that integrated FEA (Finite Element Analysis) with PyTorch to significantly reduce computation times.

Result: The proposed method generates FEM directly from 3D CT images, reducing reliance on manual segmentation and labor-intensive processes, while maintaining speed and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses key barriers in TAA rupture risk assessment by combining deep learning and biomechanical modeling techniques, paving the way for clinically scalable and timely risk evaluation.

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in
the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal
bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.
From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on
the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be
obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite
Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be
calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure
model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture
risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited
due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient
specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it
time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and
computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and
incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was
successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA
library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA
functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static
determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately
three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the
PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to
only a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier
through the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of
generating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D
CT images.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Argus framework to automate test oracle creation for DBMS testing using LLMs, addressing design challenges and reducing false positives through formal validation to uncover bugs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the manual design bottleneck in DBMS test oracle generation and leverage LLMs' creativity for automated testing, while addressing associated challenges like hallucinations and efficiency.

Method: The framework employs LLMs to generate SQL skeleton query pairs with placeholders. Semantic equivalence of pairs is verified formally using a SQL equivalence solver. Verified skeletons are instantiated with concrete SQL snippets synthesized by LLMs.

Result: Argus discovered 40 previously unknown bugs in five well-tested DBMSs, with 36 confirmed and 26 fixes implemented by developers.

Conclusion: Argus demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLMs in automated DBMS testing for test oracle generation, providing a scalable, efficient, and accurate bug detection approach.

Abstract: Since 2020, automated testing for Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has
flourished, uncovering hundreds of bugs in widely-used systems. A cornerstone
of these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to
generate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the
consistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be
automated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper
explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and
instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards
fully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,
they are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug
reports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM
invocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and
economical.
  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core
concept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing
placeholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a
placeholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate
pairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This
equivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure
soundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are
instantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by
LLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and
evaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously
unknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already
fixed by the developers.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap between classical imperative process models based on Petri nets and relational databases. It provides a method to translate imperative models into SQL queries for conformance checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical imperative process models struggle to be directly applicable to structured process execution data stored in relational databases, leading to under-utilization of available models.

Method: The authors propose an approach to convert imperative process models into relaxed SQL queries, enabling conformance checking on relational databases.

Result: Their approach demonstrates the relevance of imperative models to data-driven process management while incorporating behavioral footprints and declarative methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the value of integrating model-based approaches with data-driven process management using innovative methodologies like SQL-query translation for conformance checking.

Abstract: Business process management is increasingly practiced using data-driven
approaches. Still, classical imperative process models, which are typically
formalized using Petri nets, are not straightforwardly applicable to the
relational databases that contain much of the available structured process
execution data. This creates a gap between the traditional world of process
modeling and recent developments around data-driven process analysis,
ultimately leading to the under-utilization of often readily available process
models. In this paper, we close this gap by providing an approach for
translating imperative models into relaxed process data queries, specifically
SQL queries executable on relational databases, for conformance checking. Our
results show the continued relevance of imperative process models to
data-driven process management, as well as the importance of behavioral
footprints and other declarative approaches for integrating model-based and
data-driven process management.

Motivation: Emulating multi-step attacks, especially those linked to advanced persistent threats, is challenging but necessary for improving defense training and tools.

Method: The authors developed and formally defined Effects Language (EL), incorporating graph-based operational semantics for attack emulation.

Result: The application of EL demonstrated better efficiency in time and resources for automating attack scenarios, and provided proofs for multi-step attacks.

Conclusion: Effects Language enhances repeatable automation for complex attack emulation, addressing key challenges in defense training and evaluation.

Abstract: The emulation of multi-step attacks attributed to advanced persistent threats
is valuable for training defenders and evaluating defense tools. In this paper,
we discuss the numerous challenges and desired attributes associated with such
automation. Additionally, we introduce the use of Effects Language (EL), a
visual programming language with graph-based operational semantics, as a
solution to address many of these challenges and requirements. We formally
define the execution semantics of EL, and prove important execution properties.
Furthermore, we showcase the application of EL to codify attacks using an
example from one of the publicly available attack scenarios. We also
demonstrate how EL can be utilized to provide proof-of-attack of complex
multi-step attacks. Our results highlight the improvements in time and resource
efficiency achieved through the use of EL for repeatable automation.

*Jiachen Li,Bang Wu,Xiaoyu Xia,Xiaoning Liu,Xun Yi,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses security vulnerabilities in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under backdoor attacks and proposes novel detection and mitigation frameworks to counter them, achieving high effectiveness without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), their security vulnerabilities, specifically to backdoor attacks, are underexplored. Traditional defenses fail in SNNs due to their energy-driven and temporal properties, necessitating dedicated solutions.

Method: The authors propose TMPBD, an unsupervised post-training detection framework that uses temporal membrane potential (TMP) statistics in the spiking layer to detect backdoors. Additionally, they introduce NDSBM, a mitigation mechanism that suppresses malicious neurons by clamping dendritic connections in early convolutional layers using TMP signals extracted from a small clean dataset.

Result: TMPBD achieves a 100% detection accuracy and, paired with NDSBM, reduces attack success rates from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when combined with detection, with no degradation in clean accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of TMPBD and NDSBM in detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks in SNNs, setting a pathway for enhancing security in SNN architectures.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their
superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have
received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform
poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal
dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional
backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection
framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome
these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal
membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels
without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust
mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM),
which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to
suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP
extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on
multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic
trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while
NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when
combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

Motivation: Copyright concerns for Large Language Models motivate the need for effective methods to verify their ownership and origin, as existing techniques often fail to produce distinct fingerprints.

Method: The authors use Fisher Information Theory to highlight the informativeness of input gradients, proposing ZeroPrint to approximate gradients in a black-box setup using zeroth-order estimation and semantic-preserving word substitutions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ZeroPrint's superior effectiveness and robustness compared to existing black-box fingerprinting methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZeroPrint significantly advances the field of LLM fingerprinting for copyright verification, offering a practical and reliable approach for distinguishing model origins in black-box settings.

Abstract: The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs)
makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about
copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to
address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic,
unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model
to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods
often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness
arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose
critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of
non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information
Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more
informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight,
we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich
gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint
overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input
perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows
ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint.
Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a
state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming
existing black-box methods.

Motivation: The authors aim to improve zero-knowledge machine learning frameworks, focusing on enabling client-side applications and efficient deployment on native EVM smart contracts.

Method: The methodology involves utilizing UltraGroth for zero-knowledge proofs, addressing preprocessing challenges, and evaluating performance on custom neural networks and mobile devices.

Result: Bionetta significantly outperformed alternatives like EZKL and zkml in proving time, demonstrating practicability on mobile devices without excessive verification overhead.

Conclusion: Bionetta is presented as a groundbreaking solution for efficient zero-knowledge machine learning applications, particularly suited for EVM smart contract environments.

Abstract: In this report, we compare the performance of our UltraGroth-based
zero-knowledge machine learning framework Bionetta to other tools of similar
purpose such as EZKL, Lagrange's deep-prove, or zkml. The results show a
significant boost in the proving time for custom-crafted neural networks: they
can be proven even on mobile devices, enabling numerous client-side proving
applications. While our scheme increases the cost of one-time preprocessing

is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that is deployable on the native
EVM smart contracts without overwhelming proof size and verification overheads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses heightened risks due to growing software complexity and the escalating need for effective vulnerability detection mechanisms.

Method: The framework employs knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from large teacher models to smaller, efficient student models. It integrates stages like data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning into a cohesive workflow.

Result: FineSec demonstrates superior performance in identifying vulnerabilities and logical flaws in C/C++ codebases compared to base models and larger LLMs.

Conclusion: FineSec is validated as a practical and scalable tool for software security that achieves robustness while being computation-efficient.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems exacerbates the
prevalence of security vulnerabilities, posing risks of severe breaches and
substantial economic loss. Consequently, robust code vulnerability detection is
essential for software security. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their
potential for automated code vulnerability detection remains underexplored.
This paper presents FineSec, a novel framework that harnesses LLMs through
knowledge distillation to enable efficient and precise vulnerability
identification in C/C++ codebases. FineSec utilizes knowledge distillation to
transfer expertise from large teacher models to compact student models,
achieving high accuracy with minimal computational cost. By integrating data
preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning into a unified,
single-task workflow, FineSec offers a streamlined approach. Extensive
evaluations on C/C++ codebases demonstrate its superiority over both base
models and larger LLMs in identifying complex vulnerabilities and logical
flaws, establishing FineSec as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
software security. To facilitate reproducibility, the datasets, source code,

*Junki Mori,Kazuya Kakizaki,Taiki Miyagawa,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DP-SynRAG is proposed as a privacy-preserving framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that avoids repeated noise injections by using synthetic differentially private RAG databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome privacy risks in sensitive domains posed by traditional RAG systems that rely on external knowledge and repetitive noise injection.

Method: Introduce the DP-SynRAG framework that uses LLMs to create synthetic differentially private databases, which avoids the need for repeated privacy interventions.

Result: Experiments show DP-SynRAG outperforms existing private RAG systems while adhering to a fixed privacy budget.

Conclusion: DP-SynRAG offers a more efficient and scalable approach to privacy-preserving RAG tasks compared to existing models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding them in external knowledge. However, its application in sensitive
domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically
rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise
injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we
propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially
private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can
be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and
additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG
tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate
text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show
that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private
RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable
solution for privacy-preserving RAG.

*Riku Mochizuki,Shusuke Komatsu,Souta Noguchi,Kazuto Ataka*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines generative engines (GEs) from a security perspective, particularly focusing on their vulnerability to web poisoning attacks and evaluating citation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of generative engines to poisoning attacks and improve citation reliability in AI-generated answers.

Method: The authors introduce evaluation criteria to assess citation publisher attributes, conduct experiments in political domains in Japan and the U.S. to estimate citation reliability, and analyze the injection barriers for content poisoning.

Result: The study reveals that political answers in the U.S. are at higher risk of poisoning attacks compared to Japan due to differences in citation sources. It finds that sources with low content-injection barriers are frequently cited but poorly integrated into answer content.

Conclusion: To mitigate poisoning threats, the paper suggests strategies for primary source publishers to improve their content exposure, noting current limitations tied to language differences.

Abstract: We analyze answers generated by generative engines (GEs) from the
perspectives of citation publishers and the content-injection barrier, defined
as the difficulty for attackers to manipulate answers to user prompts by
placing malicious content on the web. GEs integrate two functions: web search
and answer generation that cites web pages using large language models. Because
anyone can publish information on the web, GEs are vulnerable to poisoning
attacks. Existing studies of citation evaluation focus on how faithfully answer
content reflects cited sources, leaving unexamined which web sources should be
selected as citations to defend against poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, we
introduce evaluation criteria that assess poisoning threats using the citation
information contained in answers. Our criteria classify the publisher
attributes of citations to estimate the content-injection barrier thereby
revealing the threat of poisoning attacks in current GEs. We conduct
experiments in political domains in Japan and the United States (U.S.) using
our criteria and show that citations from official party websites (primary
sources) are approximately \(25\%\)--\(45\%\) in the U.S. and
\(60\%\)--\(65\%\) in Japan, indicating that U.S. political answers are at
higher risk of poisoning attacks. We also find that sources with low
content-injection barriers are frequently cited yet are poorly reflected in
answer content. To mitigate this threat, we discuss how publishers of primary
sources can increase exposure of their web content in answers and show that
well-known techniques are limited by language differences.

### [385] [VelLMes: A high-interaction AI-based deception framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06975)
*Muris Sladić,Veronica Valeros,Carlos Catania,Sebastian Garcia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces VelLMes, an AI-based cyber-deception framework leveraging LLMs to simulate various honeypot services such as SSH, MySQL, POP3, and HTTP, evaluated for realism and interactivity against human attackers and real-life scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deception systems based on LLMs are limited in scope and lack comprehensive evaluation involving human attackers. Generative AI advances offer potential to enhance cyber-deception capabilities.

Method: The researchers created VelLMes, a framework utilizing LLMs for realistic simulation of multiple service protocols. They assessed generative performance through unit tests and deception capabilities through interaction with human attackers and internet-deployed honeypots.

Result: LLMs showed high generative realism in unit tests, achieving up to 100% passing rates. About 30% of human attackers mistook VelLMes honeypots for real systems. Internet deployment demonstrated robustness against diverse unstructured attacks.

Conclusion: VelLMes proves effective as a deception framework, offering realistic, interactive honeypots adaptable to multiple services and capable of handling both targeted and real-world cyber-attacks.

Abstract: There are very few SotA deception systems based on Large Language Models. The
existing ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH
shells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -
lack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has
recently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and
practitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers
have demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking
honeytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as
honeypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,
which can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,
MySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus
VelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'
needs. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and
realism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities
and the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using
unit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful
prompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having
a 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception
capabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the
attackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were
assigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH
Linux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of
these attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform
well against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding
correctly to most of the issued commands.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RedTWIZ, a framework to rigorously test Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development by focusing on conversational vulnerabilities and exposing weaknesses using adaptive, multi-turn attack strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing and improving the robustness of LLMs, especially concerning conversational vulnerabilities and unsafe outputs in AI-assisted software development.

Method: RedTWIZ utilizes a unified framework that includes assessment of conversational jailbreaks, diverse generative attack strategies, and a hierarchical attack planner that adapts attacks to LLM vulnerabilities.

Result: Experiments show that RedTWIZ's multi-turn attacks can effectively induce state-of-the-art LLMs to generate unsafe outputs, underscoring the vulnerabilities in current systems.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical need for robust methods to evaluate and strengthen LLM defenses, particularly against sophisticated conversational jailbreak strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents the vision, scientific contributions, and technical
details of RedTWIZ: an adaptive and diverse multi-turn red teaming framework,
to audit the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-assisted software
development. Our work is driven by three major research streams: (1) robust and
systematic assessment of LLM conversational jailbreaks; (2) a diverse
generative multi-turn attack suite, supporting compositional, realistic and
goal-oriented jailbreak conversational strategies; and (3) a hierarchical
attack planner, which adaptively plans, serializes, and triggers attacks
tailored to specific LLM's vulnerabilities. Together, these contributions form
a unified framework -- combining assessment, attack generation, and strategic
planning -- to comprehensively evaluate and expose weaknesses in LLMs'
robustness. Extensive evaluation is conducted to systematically assess and
analyze the performance of the overall system and each component. Experimental
results demonstrate that our multi-turn adversarial attack strategies can
successfully lead state-of-the-art LLMs to produce unsafe generations,
highlighting the pressing need for more research into enhancing LLM's
robustness.

TL;DR: A new benchmark for generating dynamic community structures in graphs is introduced to test community detection algorithms, addressing overlooked aspects of community evolution in networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph benchmarks lack focus on tracking the evolution of communities in real-world networks, motivating a need for realistic models.

Method: A community-centered graph model was proposed that enables simulation of dynamically evolving communities and temporal networks.

Result: The benchmark successfully tested three methods for tracking nodes' cluster memberships and detecting community transitions using customizable metrics.

Conclusion: The study offers tools and metrics, alongside the benchmark model, to improve the assessment of community detection algorithms for evolving networks.

Abstract: Graph models help understand network dynamics and evolution. Creating graphs
with controlled topology and embedded partitions is a common strategy for
evaluating community detection algorithms. However, existing benchmarks often
overlook the need to track the evolution of communities in real-world networks.
To address this, a new community-centered model is proposed to generate
customizable evolving community structures where communities can grow, shrink,
merge, split, appear or disappear. This benchmark also generates the underlying
temporal network, where nodes can appear, disappear, or move between
communities. The benchmark has been used to test three methods, measuring their
performance in tracking nodes' cluster membership and detecting community
evolution. Python libraries, drawing utilities, and validation metrics are
provided to compare ground truth with algorithm results for detecting dynamic
communities.

TL;DR: This study analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) on Reddit from 2022 to 2024, finding it moderately present but influential in certain communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative AI-produced text integrates and influences social media, especially Reddit.

Method: Used state-of-the-art statistical detection methods to examine Reddit activity across 51 subreddits over two years.

Result: MGT is marginally present overall but peaks at 9% in specific communities, shows distinct stylistic signals, and achieves comparable or better engagement levels than human-authored texts.

Conclusion: MGT is becoming an organic part of online discourse; further studies on its impact on community dynamics and governance are needed.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by
enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost.
While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how
MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the
first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art
statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity
(2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community
types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the
concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to
human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it
receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that
synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to
9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across
communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and
social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of
users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving
typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT
achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few
cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic
component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on
the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving
platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.

*Bang Chen,Lijun Guo,Houli Fan,Wentao He,Rong Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEFGNN, a framework for identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) by integrating multiple biological networks through uncertainty-aware decision-level fusion, showing superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve CDG identification by overcoming the limitations of using a single PPI network or representation-level fusion of multiple networks, which may miss network heterogeneity and introduce conflicts.

Method: The proposed method, SEFGNN, treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and uses Dempster-Shafer Theory for decision-level fusion, along with a Soft Evidence Smoothing module to enhance stability and maintain performance.

Result: SEFGNN demonstrates consistent outperformance compared to existing methods across three cancer datasets and shows promise in identifying new CDGs.

Conclusion: SEFGNN provides a robust and effective approach to CDG identification by leveraging uncertainty-aware fusion and addressing limitations in prior methods, offering significant potential for advancing cancer research.

Abstract: Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer
mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have
recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological
interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information
from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by
aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene
representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level
fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may
overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To
address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a
novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision
level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each
biological network as an independent evidence source and performs
uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory
(DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a
Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while
preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets
show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a pilot onboarding program using systems thinking and Labelled Transition System modelling to enhance comprehensions skills in new hires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many software industry graduates lack preparation in understanding large, complex software systems.

Method: A five-session course with a structured modelling approach and pre/post assessments was provided to 35 new hires.

Result: Participants below median showed significant improvement, while above median regressed slightly. Feedback indicated high engagement and perceived usefulness.

Conclusion: Onboarding interventions focused on modelling can benefit less-prepared hires but require tailored approaches for stronger hires and scalability across companies.

Abstract: Working effectively with large, existing software systems requires strong
comprehension skills, yet most graduates enter the industry with little
preparation for this challenge. We report early results from a pilot
intervention integrated into a SaaS company's onboarding program: a
five-session course introducing systems thinking and Labelled Transition System
(LTS) modelling. Participants articulated their understanding of product
behaviour using a structured template and completed matched pre- and
post-assessments. Of 35 new hires, 31 provided paired records for analysis.
Across the full cohort, gains were small and not statistically significant.
However, participants below the median on the pre-test improved by 15
percentage points on average (statistically significant), while those above the
median regressed slightly (not statistically significant). Course feedback
indicated high engagement and perceived applicability. These results suggest
that short, modelling-focused onboarding interventions can accelerate
comprehension for less-prepared new hires. At the same time, they point to the
need for differentiated pathways for stronger participants, and to the
potential for companies to adopt such interventions at scale as a low-cost
complement to existing onboarding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online education platforms need assessment tools that evaluate both answer accuracy and cognitive depth in line with curriculum goals.

Method: Implemented a rubric-based framework powered by LLMs that evaluates correctness and the quality of problem-solving across five dimensions. Conducted a field study with middle school students involving quadratic equation tasks with block coding.

Result: The LLM-based rubric evaluation closely aligned with expert ratings and provided process-oriented feedback, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: LLM-driven rubric assessments are valid, scalable, and beneficial for STEM education in online learning environments.

Abstract: As online education platforms continue to expand, there is a growing need for
assessment methods that not only measure answer accuracy but also capture the
depth of students' cognitive processes in alignment with curriculum objectives.
This study proposes and evaluates a rubric-based assessment framework powered
by a large language model (LLM) for measuring algebraic competence,
real-world-context block coding tasks. The problem set, designed by mathematics
education experts, aligns each problem segment with five predefined rubric
dimensions, enabling the LLM to assess both correctness and quality of
students' problem-solving processes. The system was implemented on an online
platform that records all intermediate responses and employs the LLM for
rubric-aligned achievement evaluation. To examine the practical effectiveness
of the proposed framework, we conducted a field study involving 42 middle
school students engaged in multi-stage quadratic equation tasks with block
coding. The study integrated learner self-assessments and expert ratings to
benchmark the system's outputs. The LLM-based rubric evaluation showed strong
agreement with expert judgments and consistently produced rubric-aligned,
process-oriented feedback. These results demonstrate both the validity and
scalability of incorporating LLM-driven rubric assessment into online
mathematics and STEM education platforms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation protocol for assessing demographic biases in vision language models in healthcare settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare relies on AI for hiring and analytics, necessitating equity and trust in model outputs.

Method: (i) Define a taxonomy of healthcare roles, (ii) create profession-aware prompts, and (iii) benchmark demographic bias using balanced face data.

Result: Empirical evidence shows consistent demographic biases across healthcare roles and models.

Conclusion: Bias identification in healthcare-related AI tools is critical for ensuring equity and patient trust.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and
reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic
attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for
healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their
operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians
and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse,
pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe
model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face
corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple
roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias
identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and
workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance,
and patient trust.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces ModQ, a question-answering framework to improve rule-sensitive content moderation and enforce community rules more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online community moderation faces challenges due to the diversity, evolution, and inconsistency of community rules enforcement.

Method: The authors developed ModQ, a QA-based framework with two model variants (extractive and multiple-choice) training on datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, using community rules for inference.

Result: ModQ models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying rule violations, generalize well to new contexts, and are lightweight and interpretable.

Conclusion: ModQ offers a scalable solution to enhance transparency and governance in online communities, suitable for both large-scale and low-resource environments.

Abstract: Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored
rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules
vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced
inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation.
In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at
scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for
rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or
generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules
at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We
implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train
them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we
construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both
models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant
rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ
models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting
low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether providing more specific prompts improves evaluation consistency of ChatGPT, finding that it doesn't; performance variance remains unchanged.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that more specific instructions lead to consistent evaluation by AI tools, leveraging the human-like mental model users often apply to systems like ChatGPT.

Method: A controlled experiment with ChatGPT tasked to evaluate 29 student submissions using four prompts of increasing specificity. Consistency was assessed using intra-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa).

Result: Contrary to expectations, increased prompt specificity did not result in significant improvements in performance consistency or reduced variance.

Conclusion: The assumption that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT behave as human evaluators is questionable; these findings underscore the need for more robust systems and better input handling.

Abstract: Many users interact with AI tools like ChatGPT using a mental model that
treats the system as human-like, which we call Model H. According to
goal-setting theory, increased specificity in goals should reduce performance
variance. If Model H holds, then prompting a chatbot with more detailed
instructions should lead to more consistent evaluation behavior.
  This paper tests that assumption through a controlled experiment in which
ChatGPT evaluated 29 student submissions using four prompts with increasing
specificity. We measured consistency using intra-rater reliability (Cohen's
Kappa) across repeated runs.
  Contrary to expectations, performance did not improve consistently with
increased prompt specificity, and performance variance remained largely
unchanged. These findings challenge the assumption that LLMs behave like human
evaluators and highlight the need for greater robustness and improved input
integration in future model development.

Result: The author provides insights and answers to the three posed questions, drawing examples and mechanisms for responsible AI regulation while addressing public interest, competitiveness, and rights protection.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of balancing innovation with regulation, fostering global accountability, and highlights implications for education and research in the context of responsible AI development.

Abstract: This short essay is a reworking of the answers offered by the author at the
Debate Session of the AIHUB (CSIC) and EduCaixa Summer School, organized by
Marta Garcia-Matos and Lissette Lemus, and coordinated by Albert Sabater
(OEIAC, UG), with the participation of Vanina Martinez-Posse (IIIA-CSIC),
Eulalia Soler (Eurecat) and Pompeu Casanovas (IIIA-CSIC) on July 4th 2025.
Albert Sabater posed three questions: (1) How can regulatory frameworks
priori-tise the protection of fundamental rights (privacy, non-discrimination,
autonomy, etc.) in the development of AI, without falling into the false
dichotomy between regulation and innova-tion? (2) Given the risks of AI (bias,
mass surveillance, manipulation), what examples of regu-lations or policies
have demonstrated that it is possible to foster responsible innovation, putting
the public interest before profitability, without giving in to competitive
pressure from actors such as China or the US? (3) In a scenario where the US
prioritizes flexibility, what mecha-nisms could ensure that international
cooperation in AI does not become a race to the bottom in rights, but rather a
global standard of accountability? The article attempts to answer these three
questions and concludes with some reflections on the relevance of the answers
for education and research.

### [396] [Artists' Views on Robotics Involvement in Painting Productions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07063)
*Francesca Cocchella,Nilay Roy Choudhury,Eric Chen,Patrícia Alves-Oliveira*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines how professional abstract artists experience co-creative painting sessions with a robotic arm versus a human partner, highlighting differences in interaction styles and responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of robotic systems in artistic co-creation and understand how professional abstract artists perceive and interact with such technology compared to human collaborators.

Method: Eight artists participated in six painting sessions, three with a human partner and three with a robotic arm. Their experiences were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted post-sessions.

Result: Human-human interactions were perceived as intuitive, dialogic, and emotionally engaging. In contrast, human-robot interactions were seen as more playful and reflective, encouraging artists to devise novel strategies to adapt to the robot's limitations.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the significance of long-term, multidisciplinary exploration of human-robot artistic co-creation, suggesting that autonomous robots inspire unique and valuable creative approaches.

Abstract: As robotic technologies evolve, their potential in artistic creation becomes
an increasingly relevant topic of inquiry. This study explores how professional
abstract artists perceive and experience co-creative interactions with an
autonomous painting robotic arm. Eight artists engaged in six painting sessions
-- three with a human partner, followed by three with the robot -- and
subsequently participated in semi-structured interviews analyzed through
reflexive thematic analysis. Human-human interactions were described as
intuitive, dialogic, and emotionally engaging, whereas human-robot sessions
felt more playful and reflective, offering greater autonomy and prompting for
novel strategies to overcome the system's limitations. This work offers one of
the first empirical investigations into artists' lived experiences with a
robot, highlighting the value of long-term engagement and a multidisciplinary
approach to human-robot co-creation.

*Jenny T. Liang,Titus Barik,Jeffrey Nichols,Eldon Schoop,Ruijia Cheng*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study examines user experience needs for designing AI-enabled interface agents (referred to as agents), involving non-AI experts in prototyping via AgentBuilder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between AI engineers and non-experts in prototyping generative AI agent experiences, ensuring diverse perspectives contribute to the design.

Method: Conducted two studies: (1) requirements elicitation with 12 participants; (2) in situ prototyping using AgentBuilder with 14 participants.

Result: Key activities and desired capabilities for agent prototyping systems were identified. Validation conducted via prototyping studies with insights into developer needs.

Conclusion: AgentBuilder serves as a valuable tool that supports diverse needs in designing agent experiences, emphasizing holistic and participatory approaches.

Abstract: Interface agents powered by generative AI models (referred to as "agents")
can automate actions based on user commands. An important aspect of developing
agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing
need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers
to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives
to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent
prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study
with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key
activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of
agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the
AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent
prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the
design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and
what their needs are in this process.

### [398] [A Multimodal GUI Architecture for Interfacing with LLM-Based Conversational Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06223)
*Hans G. W. van Dam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an architecture enabling GUIs to integrate LLM-based speech assistants for seamless voice accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUIs were not designed for speech-enabled interaction, necessitating frameworks to bridge natural language interfaces with visual systems.

Method: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is used to make application navigation and semantics accessible, alongside the ViewModel to provide tools for interaction.

Result: Recent open-weight LLMs show competitive performance against proprietary models, proving effective for speech-enabled multimodal UIs.

Conclusion: The proposed system ensures accessibility, feedback alignment, privacy, and future compatibility with OS advancements.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now
make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through
natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through
the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind.
This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface
with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.
  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics
available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to
the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view
and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This
architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable
alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by
consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS
super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume
MCP if an application provides it.
  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical
effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled
multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight
models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall
accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

*Suchismita Naik,Austin L. Toombs,Amanda Snellinger,Scott Saponas,Amanda K. Hall*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines multi-agent generative AI tools adopted by Microsoft, their conceptualization as collaborative "teams," and associated challenges like transparency and error mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how early adopters and developers perceive and conceptualize the role and dynamics of multi-agent generative AI tools in human-AI collaboration and workflow integration.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 developers at Microsoft, focusing on their experiences as early adopters of multi-agent generative AI systems.

Result: Early adopters view multi-agent systems as structured collaborations with specialized task roles, highlighting challenges like error propagation, agent loop behaviors, and layered transparency issues for trust and efficiency.

Conclusion: Insights advance CSCW research on collaborative mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of transparency, error tracing, and customization for diverse workflows, suggesting future directions for inter-agent and human-AI interactions.

Abstract: With recent advancements in multi-agent generative AI (Gen AI), technology
organizations like Microsoft are adopting these complex tools, redefining AI
agents as active collaborators in complex workflows rather than as passive
tools. In this study, we investigated how early adopters and developers
conceptualize multi-agent Gen AI tools, focusing on how they understand
human-AI collaboration mechanisms, general collaboration dynamics, and
transparency in the context of AI tools. We conducted semi-structured
interviews with 13 developers, all early adopters of multi-agent Gen AI
technology who work at Microsoft. Our findings revealed that these early
adopters conceptualize multi-agent systems as "teams" of specialized role-based
and task-based agents, such as assistants or reviewers, structured similar to
human collaboration models and ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted,
user-controlled interactions. We identified key challenges, including error
propagation, unpredictable and unproductive agent loop behavior, and the need
for clear communication to mitigate the layered transparency issues. Early
adopters' perspectives about the role of transparency underscored its
importance as a way to build trust, verify and trace errors, and prevent
misuse, errors, and leaks. The insights and design considerations we present
contribute to CSCW research about collaborative mechanisms with capabilities
ranging from AI-dominant to AI-assisted interactions, transparency and
oversight strategies in human-agent and agent-agent interactions, and how
humans make sense of these multi-agent systems as dynamic, role-diverse
collaborators which are customizable for diverse needs and workflows. We
conclude with future research directions that extend CSCW approaches to the
design of inter-agent and human mediation interactions.

### [400] [Evaluating Node-tree Interfaces for AI Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06457)
*Lifei Wang,Natalie Friedman,Chengchao Zhu,Zeshu Zhu,S. Joy Mountford*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study compared chatbot interfaces and node-tree interfaces, finding that node-tree interfaces boost brainstorming, task performance, and user trust by preserving context, and encourage adaptive AI designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in explainability and user trust in AI interfaces as large language models are increasingly integrated into workplace tools and decision-making.

Method: The researchers developed a node-tree interface that visually structures AI-generated responses into hierarchies, enabling interaction and refinement. They conducted a comparative study with 20 business users to evaluate task performance in exploratory and decision-making contexts.

Result: The node-tree interface enhanced brainstorming and outperformed chatbots in supporting complex tasks. It also boosted user trust by preserving contextual information.

Conclusion: Adaptive interfaces that switch between visualizations and conversational formats based on tasks can significantly improve transparency, user confidence, and trust in AI systems for enterprise applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in workplace tools and
decision-making processes, ensuring explainability and fostering user trust are
critical. Although advancements in LLM engineering continue, human-centered
design is still catching up, particularly when it comes to embedding
transparency and trust into AI interfaces. This study evaluates user
experiences with two distinct AI interfaces - node-tree interfaces and chatbot
interfaces - to assess their performance in exploratory, follow-up inquiry,
decision-making, and problem-solving tasks. Our design-driven approach
introduces a node-tree interface that visually structures AI-generated
responses into hierarchically organized, interactive nodes, allowing users to
navigate, refine, and follow up on complex information. In a comparative study
with n=20 business users, we observed that while the chatbot interface
effectively supports linear, step-by-step queries, it is the node-tree
interface that enhances brainstorming. Quantitative and qualitative findings
indicate that node-tree interfaces not only improve task performance and
decision-making support but also promote higher levels of user trust by
preserving context. Our findings suggest that adaptive AI interfaces capable of
switching between structured visualizations and conversational formats based on
task requirements can significantly enhance transparency and user confidence in
AI-powered systems. This work contributes actionable insights to the fields of
human-robot interaction and AI design, particularly for enterprise applications
where trust-building is critical for teams.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study assesses the performance of zero-shot large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4V and GPT-5, on chart-reading tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how model architecture and prompting affect inference accuracy on complex visualization questions.

Method: The authors tested LLMs by asking 107 visualization-related questions to compare accuracy between GPT-4V and GPT-5, focusing on difficult instances where GPT-4V struggled.

Result: GPT-5 achieved significantly better accuracy than GPT-4V, showing that model architecture had a larger impact than prompt design.

Conclusion: Model architecture plays a dominant role in improving inference accuracy, with minimal improvements from prompt variation.

Abstract: We present a quantitative evaluation to understand the effect of zero-shot
large-language model (LLMs) and prompting uses on chart reading tasks. We asked
LLMs to answer 107 visualization questions to compare inference accuracies
between the agentic GPT-5 and multimodal GPT-4V, for difficult image instances,
where GPT-4V failed to produce correct answers. Our results show that model
architecture dominates the inference accuracy: GPT5 largely improved accuracy,
while prompt variants yielded only small effects. Pre-registration of this work

### [402] [Emotionally Vulnerable Subtype of Internet Gaming Disorder: Measuring and Exploring the Pathology of Problematic Generative AI Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06908)
*Haocan Sun,Di Wua,Weizi Liu,Guoming Yua,Mike Yao*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study created and validated a 9-item scale (PUGenAIS-9) to measure problematic use of generative AI, using established addiction frameworks and empirical tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing concern about over-pathologizing generative AI use and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding its potential addictive qualities.

Method: The researchers conducted confirmatory factor analysis and validated a 9-item scale (PUGenAIS-9) using samples from China and the U.S., employing both latent profile and network analysis to assess its applicability and robustness.

Result: The PUGenAIS-9 scale successfully identifies problematic generative AI use, especially in profiles resembling the emotionally vulnerable subtype of Internet Gaming Disorder.

Conclusion: The PUGenAIS-9 is a reliable tool for identifying problematic GenAI use, and the study emphasizes rethinking digital addiction with a new ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model to prevent over-pathologizing.

Abstract: Concerns over the potential over-pathologization of generative AI (GenAI) use
and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding GenAI addiction call for
empirical tools and theoretical refinement. This study developed and validated
the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9
items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the
Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the
United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and
identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then
derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each
dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426).
Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and
gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered
(network analysis) approaches found that PUGenAIS matches the traits of the
emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD, not the competence-based kind. These
results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the
need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and
device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while
avoiding over-pathologizing.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper outlines a roadmap for neurotechnology development to address interdisciplinary challenges and accelerate their application in clinical and non-clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurotechnologies have transformative potential for brain-body interaction control, but realizing their benefits requires interdisciplinary collaboration and solving complex challenges.

Method: A strategic roadmap was developed by early-career researchers to define cross-disciplinary challenges, opportunities, and trade-offs in neurotechnology innovation.

Result: Five critical trade-offs were identified (functionality, scalability, adaptability, translatability), along with a unified framework for overcoming them.

Conclusion: The proposed roadmap aims to align technical advancements with societal needs, fostering equitable and impactful neurotechnology development globally.

Abstract: Neurotechnologies are transforming how we measure, interpret, and modulate
brain-body interactions, integrating real-time sensing, computation, and
stimulation to enable precise physiological control. They hold transformative
potential across clinical and non-clinical domains, from treating disorders to
enhancing cognition and performance. Realizing this potential requires
navigating complex, interdisciplinary challenges spanning neuroscience,
materials science, device engineering, signal processing, computational
modelling, and regulatory and ethical frameworks. This Perspective presents a
strategic roadmap for neurotechnology development, created by early-career
researchers, highlighting their role at the intersection of disciplines and
their capacity to bridge traditional silos. We identify five cross-cutting
trade-offs that constrain progress across functionality, scalability,
adaptability, and translatability, and illustrate how technical domains
influence their resolution. Rather than a domain-specific review, we focus on
shared challenges and strategic opportunities that transcend disciplines. We
propose a unified framework for collaborative innovation and education,
highlight ethical and regulatory priorities, and outline a timeline for
overcoming key bottlenecks. By aligning technical development with
translational and societal needs, this roadmap aims to accelerate equitable,
effective, and future-ready adaptive neurotechnologies, guiding coordinated
efforts across the global research and innovation community.

*Elena Senger,Yuri Campbell,Rob van der Goot,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) methods by introducing a robust LLM-based model and a new benchmark spanning seven diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ATE methods have limited scalability, domain transfer issues, and rely on expensive human annotations, restricting practical deployment.

Method: The authors use a black-box LLM to generate pseudo-labels across domains, fine-tune LLMs for ATE, and employ post-hoc heuristics to improve document-level consistency.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms supervised cross-domain models and few-shot learning baselines on 5/7 domains, achieving an average improvement of 10 percentage points.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new benchmark for ATE, introduces a high-performing model, and releases resources to facilitate future research in the field.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP
tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis.
Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and
struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This
highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic
evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark
spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the
document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model
that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot
learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this
benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this
black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability.
Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance
document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we
introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous
approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points.
We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this
area.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3Retrieve, a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal medical retrieval models using text and image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of a standard benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of multimodal retrieval models in medical settings.

Method: The researchers developed M3Retrieve, a dataset spanning 5 domains, 16 medical fields, and 4 tasks, with extensive text documents and multimodal queries. They also evaluated leading models using this benchmark.

Result: The study highlights specific challenges in retrieval performance across medical specialties and provides a resource to systematically compare models.

Conclusion: M3Retrieve serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal medical retrieval systems by promoting systematic evaluation and innovation.

Abstract: With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong
retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare,
multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images
offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering,
cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often
includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to
evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this
gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark.
M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over
1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under
approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this
benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities
and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing
M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation,
and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal
retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code
are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulation systems struggle with scalability across diverse scenarios and lack modularity, limiting their reusability and performance.

Method: The authors developed a modular, object-oriented hierarchical structure framework, introduced derived classes for specific applications, and implemented a memory summarization mechanism to refine memory data.

Result: The framework was used to customize a simulated environment, effectively simulating human interactions on social media and replicating real-world online behaviors.

Conclusion: The developed modular framework successfully enhances scalability and reusability in simulating multi-agent social interactions. Its source code will be made available for future development.

Abstract: Multi-agent social interaction has clearly benefited from Large Language
Models. However, current simulation systems still face challenges such as
difficulties in scaling to diverse scenarios and poor reusability due to a lack
of modular design. To address these issues, we designed and developed a
modular, object-oriented framework that organically integrates various base
classes through a hierarchical structure, harvesting scalability and
reusability. We inherited the framework to realize common derived classes.
Additionally, a memory summarization mechanism is proposed to filter and
distill relevant information from raw memory data, prioritizing contextually
salient events and interactions. By selecting and combining some necessary
derived classes, we customized a specific simulated environment. Utilizing this
simulated environment, we successfully simulated human interactions on social
media, replicating real-world online social behaviors. The source code for the
project will be released and evolve.

*Ye Hong,Yatao Zhang,Konrad Schindler,Martin Raubal*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: MobilityGen is a deep generative model designed to simulate realistic and diverse individual mobility trajectories, addressing challenges in transport planning, urban design, and public health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling human mobility is important for transport planning, urban development, and public health. Existing models struggle to capture the complex and context-dependent nature of individual mobility behavior.

Method: The authors developed MobilityGen, a deep generative model that links behavioral attributes with environmental contexts and incorporates spatio-temporal variability. It accounts for scaling laws, activity time allocation, and the interaction between travel modes and destinations.

Result: MobilityGen can generate realistic and novel mobility patterns. It reproduces observed patterns like location visit scaling laws and travel mode-destination coupling, while reflecting spatial and temporal variations.

Conclusion: MobilityGen surpasses prior models by providing actionable insights on urban access, social dynamics, and segregation, enabling fine-grained, data-driven analyses of mobility and human behavior.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in
transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite
decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because
of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we present
MobilityGen, a deep generative model that produces realistic mobility
trajectories spanning days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking
behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key
patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation,
and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects
spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel
mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard
validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models,
including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how
co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Our work
establishes a new framework for mobility simulation, paving the way for
fine-grained, data-driven studies of human behavior and its societal
implications.

*Mengqi Lou,Guy Bresler,Ashwin Pananjady*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper develops efficient methods to map a sample from one Gaussian distribution to another distribution uniformly for any parameter. The method helps to derive computational limits for various statistical models using complexity-theoretic reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing computational challenges in generating samples from specific target distributions and understanding the intrinsic statistical-to-computational trade-offs for high-dimensional statistical models.

Method: The authors design procedures that facilitate reductions, allowing them to generate samples from different distributions and analyze computational limits under conjectures in average-case complexity.

Result: The paper extends computational lower bounds of Gaussian-specific models to generalized non-Gaussian setups. It resolves a key conjecture about gaps in $k$-sparse models and ties the phase diagrams of related statistical problems while preserving computational properties.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates reduction-based techniques to generalize computational lower bounds and confirms statistical-to-computational gaps in problems like $k$-sparse phase retrieval and submatrix models.

Abstract: Given a single observation from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean
$\theta$, we design computationally efficient procedures that can approximately
generate an observation from a different target distribution $Q_{\theta}$
uniformly for all $\theta$ in a parameter set. We leverage our technique to
establish reduction-based computational lower bounds for several canonical
high-dimensional statistical models under widely-believed conjectures in
average-case complexity. In particular, we cover cases in which:
  1. $Q_{\theta}$ is a general location model with non-Gaussian distribution,
including both light-tailed examples (e.g., generalized normal distributions)
and heavy-tailed ones (e.g., Student's $t$-distributions). As a consequence, we
show that computational lower bounds proved for spiked tensor PCA with Gaussian
noise are universal, in that they extend to other non-Gaussian noise
distributions within our class.
  2. $Q_{\theta}$ is a normal distribution with mean $f(\theta)$ for a general,
smooth, and nonlinear link function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
Using this reduction, we construct a reduction from symmetric mixtures of
linear regressions to generalized linear models with link function $f$, and
establish computational lower bounds for solving the $k$-sparse generalized
linear model when $f$ is an even function. This result constitutes the first
reduction-based confirmation of a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-to-computational gap
in $k$-sparse phase retrieval, resolving a conjecture posed by Cai et al.
(2016). As a second application, we construct a reduction from the sparse
rank-1 submatrix model to the planted submatrix model, establishing a pointwise
correspondence between the phase diagrams of the two models that faithfully
preserves regions of computational hardness and tractability.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: GyroSwin introduces a scalable 5D neural surrogate to model nonlinear plasma turbulence, improving heat transport predictions and reducing computational costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of modeling plasma turbulence, a critical element impairing nuclear fusion energy confinement and requiring accurate predictions for next-generation reactor designs.

Method: GyroSwin leverages Vision Transformers extended to 5D, cross-attention mechanisms for latent dimensional interactions, and mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics to approximate turbulent transport.

Result: The approach outperformed reduced models, capturing non-linear plasma turbulence effects, enhancing prediction accuracy of heat flux, and reducing simulation costs by three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: GyroSwin offers scalable and physically-verifiable models, showing promise for future high-parameter gyrokinetic simulations to enhance plasma confinement in fusion reactors.

Abstract: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable
energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding
plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital
for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the
nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over
time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often
employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,
they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D
nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena
neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent
heat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,
(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent
3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and
the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation
inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely
used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy
cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three
orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows
promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for
scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.

### [410] [Mass Conservation on Rails -- Rethinking Physics-Informed Learning of Ice Flow Vector Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06286)
*Kim Bente,Roman Marchant,Fabio Ramos*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs) to accurately model Antarctic ice flow by enforcing exact mass conservation, surpassing the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reliability of Antarctic ice sheet models for future sea level rise projections by embedding physics principles and addressing limitations in current neural network approaches.

Method: The authors design dfNNs that enforce local mass conservation precisely using vector calculus. These are compared with PINNs and unconstrained NNs, applying a learning strategy called directional guidance using satellite velocity data.

Result: DfNNs demonstrated superior reliability in ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier, outperforming PINNs and unconstrained NNs, particularly when directional guidance was used.

Conclusion: Exact enforcement of physical constraints, such as mass conservation, enhances model reliability and robustness for ice flow interpolation, providing a promising direction for sea level rise modeling.

Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs
that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into
models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse & noisy
measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy
and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics
as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead
propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass
conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs,
PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier
suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and
that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide
satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.

Result: The study highlights the diverse visualization techniques available, their practical implementations, and their limitations, emphasizing the absence of a universally perfect solution.

Conclusion: Visualization of search landscapes is complex and requires trade-offs; recommendations for future research are provided to further advance this field.

Abstract: This work walks through different visualization techniques for combinatorial
search landscapes, focusing on multimodality. We discuss different techniques
from the landscape analysis literature, and how they can be combined to provide
a more comprehensive view of the search landscape. We also include examples and
discuss relevant work to show how others have used these techniques in
practice, based on the geometric and aesthetic elements of the Grammar of
Graphics. We conclude that there is no free lunch in visualization, and provide
recommendations for future work as there are several paths to continue the work
in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in capturing and rendering 3D objects in real time, which are crucial for applications like augmented reality and remote collaboration.

Method: The proposed pipeline involves smartphone video scanning, cloud-based 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, and Unity-based rendering at 150 fps on a laptop.

Result: The system achieves 3D object reconstruction in 10 minutes using a GPU and real-time rendering on laptops.

Conclusion: The pipeline demonstrates an effective solution for real-time, interactive 3D object visualization using scalable mobile and cloud technologies.

Abstract: Capturing and rendering three-dimensional (3D) objects in real time remain a
significant challenge, yet hold substantial potential for applications in
augmented reality, digital twin systems, remote collaboration and prototyping.
We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS)
to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects
using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an
object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and
visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second
(fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and
Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that
the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics
processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop.
